{"Headline": "Russian Banker Denies Role in Planned Trump Building in Moscow", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A top Russian banker said Friday that his bank never had a role in a project once planned by the Trump Organization to build a tower in Moscow, despite an assertion by one of President Trump\u2019s associates that the banker had helped finance the deal.The Times reported in August that Mr. Sater had boasted in a series of emails to the lawyer, Michael Cohen, that he had close ties to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. He said that building a Trump tower in Moscow would demonstrate Mr. Trump\u2019s business prowess and help get him elected president. The emails were provided to the House Intelligence Committee in August as part of the panel\u2019s inquiry into Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt last year\u2019s election.Mr. Kostin said a review by the bank\u2019s security department of all emails and documents showed that Mr. Sater had no dealings with the bank. \u201cWe never, ever heard about this case,\u201d Mr. Kostin said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely wrong information; it\u2019s absolutely fake news.\u201dIn one of the emails given to the House committee, Mr. Sater said that he had lined up financing through Mr. Kostin.\u201cI will get Putin on this program, and we will get Donald elected,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote in the email.In another message to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater said that \u201cour boy can become president of the U.S.A. and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin\u2019s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.\u201dMr. Kostin said that he was skeptical of intelligence agencies\u2019 determination that the Russian government had meddled in the election, and that he believed Democrats had used that issue as part of a strategy to undermine Mr. Trump.Mr. Kostin said that while many in Russia last year did not believe that Mr. Trump would win the election, they were optimistic that he might do more to improve relations between Russia and the United States than his opponent, Hillary Clinton.He added, \u201cI would think that Trump was seen as a better solution for Russia.\u201dAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized the type of assistance Felix Sater gave to federal investigations. He was a cooperating witness for the Justice Department, and was not an F.B.I. informant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Is Humming, but That May Not Win Janet Yellen Another Term", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Since Janet L. Yellen became the Federal Reserve\u2019s chairwoman in February 2014, unemployment in the United States has steadily declined while inflation has remained low. Few Fed chairmen have achieved comparable success.Yet President Trump, who is scheduled to meet Ms. Yellen on Thursday, says he is still considering whether to nominate her for a second four-year term, and key White House aides are pressing for her to be replaced.She may also become a victim of her own success. Steady economic growth and the tranquillity of financial markets have emboldened some critics, who see an opportune moment for a transition to new leadership.But Mr. Trump also faces warnings that replacing Ms. Yellen is an unnecessary risk to the economic growth the president has repeatedly pointed to as a primary success of his young administration.\u201cThe economy is humming along,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, a New York economic research firm. \u201cThe markets are humming along. Given all the other stuff that\u2019s going on, why mess with that?\u201d\u201cHonestly, I like them all,\u201d Mr. Trump said Tuesday. He added that he would choose a nominee \u201cover the next very short period of time.\u201d The White House would like to make the nomination before he departs for a 12-day trip to Asia in early November. Ms. Yellen\u2019s term ends in early February, and the next chairman must be confirmed by the Senate.Ms. Yellen, 71, has spent almost two decades at the Fed. She was a Fed governor in the mid-1990s, then returned to the Fed as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004. She became vice chairwoman in 2010 and chairwoman in 2014.Ms. Yellen\u2019s calm and careful leadership style has won fans, both inside and outside of the Fed. John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that Ms. Yellen had been effective in building a consensus about the direction of policy among Fed officials, and in communicating policy to the markets and the public.\u201cWhen she came in there was a lot of concern about how would we unwind our policies and would that be disruptive and difficult, especially in the context of a global economy where other central banks were going in the other direction,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s almost like, \u2018That was easy!\u2019 But it wasn\u2019t. It took hard work.\u201dSome of the other candidates, notably Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh, have argued the Fed should be raising interest rates more quickly. But financial regulation is the area in which a new chairman likely would make the largest changes. The Fed supervises the nation\u2019s largest banks and oversees the broader financial system.The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has argued that installing a new Fed chairman would help Mr. Trump achieve his goal of reducing regulation.Charles W. Calomiris, a finance professor at Columbia University, said that Ms. Yellen\u2019s approach to regulation was reason enough to replace her. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that regulation is excessively costly and complex,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also failing to achieve its objectives.\u201dBut Ms. Yellen has faced relatively little public criticism. Mr. Trump criticized her on the campaign trail, but he has praised her since taking office.Mr. Trump\u2019s choice, Randal K. Quarles, who was sworn in last week, will oversee the Fed\u2019s regulatory work, including its stress tests of large banks.Mr. Hensarling also has criticized Ms. Yellen\u2019s approach to monetary policy. But he has not commented on whether Ms. Yellen should be nominated for a second term, and a spokeswoman did not respond to an email on Wednesday.A spokeswoman for Senator Michael D. Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the Banking Committee, said he had not taken a position on Ms. Yellen\u2019s candidacy.Even some of Ms. Yellen\u2019s critics favor her reappointment.\u201cShe is an intelligent and levelheaded individual,\u201d said Deborah J. Lucas, an economics professor at M.I.T. who has criticized the Fed\u2019s bond purchases. \u201cI trust her to make prudent decisions, particularly when it matters most, which is if there is another crisis. Continuity and experience seem especially valuable right now.\u201dPresidents in recent decades have generally decided to reappoint Fed chairmen, even from the opposing political party, on the theory that stability would comfort markets. Ronald Reagan, the last Republican president to inherit a Fed chairman who was a Democrat, thought seriously about replacing Paul A. Volcker in 1983, but ultimately decided to nominate Mr. Volcker to a second term. \u201cThe financial market seems set on having him,\u201d Reagan wrote in his diary. \u201cI don\u2019t want to shake their confidence in recovery.\u201dPresident Clinton nominated Alan Greenspan in 1996 and in 2000 and President George W. Bush nominated Mr. Greenspan to a fifth term in 2004, before tapping Ben S. Bernanke to begin in 2006.President Obama nominated Mr. Bernanke for a second term in 2010. When Mr. Bernanke stepped down in 2014, Mr. Obama named Ms. Yellen.The last Fed chairman who did not serve a second term was G. William Miller, who is widely regarded as the least effective leader in the Fed\u2019s modern history. Mr. Miller was also the last person without an economics degree to run the central bank. He was nominated by President Carter in 1978. Both unemployment and inflation were high and rising, and he was replaced after just 17 months by Mr. Volcker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once So Chic and Swooshy, Freeways Are Falling Out of Favor", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "Several cities face pressure to tear down the 1960s-era mega-roads and reinstate pedestrian-friendly streets. Jane Jacobs told you so!Supported byBUFFALO \u2014 The Scajaquada Corridor is a city dweller\u2019s dreamland, a culture-vulture Valhalla. Within two miles there is a restored Frank Lloyd Wright house you can visit, an art museum with Picassos and Gauguins, three college campuses, a zoo and a history museum in a majestic Greek Revival building from the 1901 Pan Am Exposition listed on the National Historic Register. All of it borders a 356-acre park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.There is just one problem: An expressway runs through it.The Scajaquada Expressway, or Route 198, is a 3.2-mile tear in the urban fabric. Built in the early 1960s, it slices Delaware Park in half, isolates north Buffalo from destinations south, makes walking or bicycling in the area a death-courting activity and creates the strange optical illusions common to freewayscapes. The Albright-Knox Art Gallery and the Buffalo History Museum are less than half a mile apart, on opposite sides of the Scajaquada. Looking across the expanse of pavement and speeding traffic, however, the distance seems insurmountable.The Scajaquada is not just a local barrier but also a poster road for a growing movement being championed by progressives in the urban-planning community. They want to tear down some highways in cities and replace all that elevated-and-barricaded pavement with lower-speed streets that favor pedestrians and bicyclists and foster greater connectivity among neighborhoods and residents.Lynn Richards, the president and chief executive officer of C.N.U., said that removing a highway is \u201ca somewhat radical idea.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of analysis that needs to go into it about where the traffic is going to go,\u201d she said.And because of a confluence of factors, including the embrace of ride-hailing services like Uber and the rebirth of cities as places to live, work, raise families and retire to, advocates like Ms. Richards see an \u201cincredible opportunity\u201d to remove even more pavement. \u201cWhen we put out a call last summer for freeways without a future, we got almost 75 recommendations,\u201d she said. \u201cThis can kick-start a conversation about the best way to spend infrastructure dollars.\u201dPerhaps the greatest argument that removal advocates have is that so much of this infrastructure is nearing the end of its life span. In this era of tight budgets and political gridlock, it may be cheaper for local and state governments to remove a freeway rather than repair or build a new one.\u201cThe Embarcadero came out of the waterfront, and now the waterfront real estate is seeing tremendous value,\u201d said Peter Park, a city planner in favor of removing highways in cities where neighborhoods have been \u201csignificantly disconnected.\u201dNot only in San Francisco but also in every case where a highway has been removed, Mr. Park argues, \u201cthe city has improved.\u201d\u201cThe basic argument for it was, people will never get to the city without it,\u201d said John Norquist, Milwaukee\u2019s mayor at the time, who spearheaded the removal campaign. \u201cWell, how do they get to Paris? The arguments were left over from this glorious age of motoring after World War II.\u201dThe bill to demolish the Park East and restore the street grid was around $30 million, significantly less than the $80 to $100 million estimated cost to rebuild the 40-year-old freeway, Mr. Norquist said. He pointed to the rising land values and the slow-but-steady development along the 26-acre corridor in the years since \u2014 and the lack of a traffic apocalypse \u2014 as signs of success.Mr. Norquist, who went on to run Congress for the New Urbanism for a decade and is now a semiretired consultant, said removing a highway is not just about addressing local residents\u2019 concerns. \u201cWe had to make the big argument, the Jane Jacobs argument, that the freeway was harmful to the whole city,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat we envision going to would be more of an urban boulevard that allows all modes of transportation \u2014 pedestrians, bicyclists and cars \u2014 to use that facility,\u201d said Angelo Trichilo, deputy chief engineer for the New York State Transportation Department.Still, some argue that the department\u2019s current plan, which eliminates features like merged lanes and uses seven new traffic lights and a raised median with curbs to slow cars, doesn\u2019t go far enough to reduce the expressway\u2019s impact or image and fails to look at the redesign in an innovative way.In the conservancy\u2019s office cottage inside Delaware Park, Ms. Crockatt and her colleagues showed a color rendering of their own \u201cvision for the new Buffalo.\u201d Most notably, their plan calls for an Olmsted-designed stone arch bridge, presently used by cars and as retained in the state\u2019s proposal, to be returned to its pedestrians and bicyclist origin \u2014 in essence, to replace pavement with grass and knit back together the park\u2019s two halves in a way that visually reduces car traffic. They also want to remove the median and scale back the footprint of eight-lane intersections.In response, Mr. Trichilo said the agency has held \u201cover 50 meetings\u201d with stakeholders and the public \u201cto build consensus that we can all agree to\u201d \u2014 though opinions diverge widely from keeping the expressway to downsizing to a two-lane road. The Transportation Department considered the conservancy\u2019s plan to eliminate traffic on the stone bridge. But based on its study, a new intersection would be required, and that intersection \u201cjust could not handle the traffic,\u201d Mr. Trichilo said, adding that the Federal Highway Administration has concurred.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to get it right now, and not finance a mistake into perpetuity,\u201d Mr. Booth said.At a Transportation Department public presentation meeting last year, Ms. Crockatt learned that for some, the 19th-century Delaware Park is the problem, not the \u201960s-era expressway.She recalled that one attendee stood up and asked, incredulously: \u201cWhy in the world did you build this park next to this highway?\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Space Council Chooses the Moon as Trump Administration Priority", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHANTILLY, Va. \u2014 Standing before the space shuttle Discovery in a voluminous hangar outside of Washington, Vice President Mike Pence announced on Thursday a renewed focus on putting Americans in space and making a return to the moon.\u201cWe will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond,\u201d Mr. Pence said during a meeting of the National Space Council.Mr. Pence did not lay out a timetable for when American astronauts would step on the moon again or propose a strategy for getting there, much less broach the topic of a price tag.In his introductory comments to the council, Mr. Pence described the United States space program as in decline, and leveled sharp criticism of the Obama administration. \u201cRather than competing with other nations to create the best space technology, the previous administration chose capitulation,\u201d he said.\u201cHave we fallen behind as we believe?\u201d Mr. Pence asked private sector aerospace executives speaking at the session. \u201cIs that your judgment from the outside?\u201dThe executives largely sidestepped the question.\u201cI would say, first of all, that is very important today, that it is an imperative,\u201d said Marillyn A. Hewson, chief executive of Lockheed Martin. She said that there was a need to be \u201cvigilant\u201d about protecting communications and intelligence satellites from attack, but then pivoted to talking about the economic, educational and inspirational benefits of the space program.She and Dennis A. Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing, both said there was a need for consistent financing and steady commitment to achieve long-term objectives in space.Officials from newer space companies, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Jeffrey P. Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin, called for public-private partnerships rather than traditional government-run programs and called for streamlining the bureaucratic process of licensing launches.Gwynne Shotwell, president of SpaceX, far from describing a neglected space program in the United States, highlighted her company\u2019s meteoric rise in recent years, with 13 launches in 2017. \u201cIn short, there is a renaissance underway right now in space,\u201d she said.The focus on the moon marks an expected turn from the priorities of the Obama administration, which had downplayed the moon and instructed NASA to instead aim for an asteroid and then Mars. The approach is more of a return to the path described by President George W. Bush in 2004 and his father, President George H.W. Bush, 15 years earlier.Both times, the initiatives petered out. Since the last Apollo moon landing in 1972, no astronauts have traveled beyond low-Earth orbit.Mr. Pence suggested that private industry might play a larger role in a moon mission this time. \u201cTo fully unlock the mysteries of space, President Trump recognizes that we must look beyond the halls of government for input and guidance,\u201d he said.What will change in practice under the Trump administration is unclear. Although the Obama administration downplayed sending NASA astronauts to the moon, it did support commercial start-ups seeking to send robotic landers there, and Mr. Pence said that the longer-term goal of getting astronauts to Mars remains.Phillip Larson, a former White House space adviser in the Obama administration and now an assistant dean at the University of Colorado engineering school disagreed with Mr. Pence\u2019s criticism. He pointed to SpaceX\u2019s success and billions of dollars of private investment in space ventures in recent years.\u201cThat type of activity is what the Obama administration worked to promote and create and foment a whole new industry,\u201d said Mr. Larson, who did not attend the meeting.He said it was also too early to tell whether the Trump administration\u2019s space efforts would succeed. \u201cIt was just very interesting to do this type of process without a NASA administrator or a science adviser in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil they produce a plan, which it looks like they\u2019re moving toward, this is mostly theater and produces a little bit of confusion, I think. I still remain optimistic.\u201dJohn Logsdon, a former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, was more positive, noting that administration had chosen to hold its first meeting publicly at a high-profile venue to draw more attention.\u201cWords are the first step to action,\u201d he said.Are the words different this time?Dr. Logsdon paused. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied wistfully.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a former White House space adviser in the Obama administration.

{"Headline": "Trump Campaign Spending on Legal Fees Surges as Russia Inquiries Widen", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s campaign spent more than $1.1 million on legal fees over the last three months \u2014 a sharp increase that coincided with the escalation of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.The spending was revealed in reports filed on Sunday with the Federal Election Commission detailing the campaign\u2019s finances from the beginning of July through the end of last month.During that period, legal fees represented more than 25 percent of all spending by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The legal spending was nearly twice as much as the campaign spent during the preceding three months.The report underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump\u2019s team has been consumed by investigations being pursued by congressional committees and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the presidential election, and connections between Russia, Mr. Trump and his associates.The biggest share of the legal payments revealed on Sunday by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the joint committees it formed with the Republican Party \u2014 $830,000 \u2014 went to Jones Day, the law firm representing the campaign in connection with the investigations.In May, the campaign sent a letter to current and former staff members instructing them to retain documents related to the campaign. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, indicated that Jones Day lawyers \u201cwill be responsible for collecting, reviewing and, if appropriate, producing materials to the congressional committees and the special counsel.\u201dMr. Futerfas did not respond to a request for comment, nor did representatives from the Trump campaign and Jones Day.Jones Day also represents the campaign in matters related to election and campaign finance law, as well as litigation stemming from the campaign, and it is not clear what percentage of the legal payments relate to those matters, as opposed to the Russia investigations.The legal spending revealed on Sunday brings to $2.1 million the legal fees paid by the campaign and its two joint committees this year.The spending not consumed by legal expenses was more reflective of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign-style political operation, which did not pause after his election, unlike most presidential campaigns\u2019 operations, which are dialed back or rolled into party committees. Mr. Trump still holds rallies around the country, and the costs included facility rentals, as well as travel and the red Make America Great Again hats sold on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign website.The campaign has also continued spending heavily on online fund-raising and other digital outreach, paying $1.1 million in the third quarter to firms run by the campaign\u2019s digital director, Brad Parscale, who also has been interviewed by congressional investigators in Russia inquiries.The Republican National Committee, which discloses its finances to the Federal Election Commission on a different schedule and did not file a report on Sunday, has also paid legal fees related to the Russia inquiries, including to Mr. Futerfas\u2019s firm. It is legally permissible for campaigns and party committees to foot the bill for legal costs that stem from matters related to the campaign in question.Not all the legal payments revealed on Sunday are related to the Russia investigations, though.In addition to the standard legal costs stemming from running any large organization, the campaign has continued to pay fees related to lawsuits against it.The campaign appears to have paid $10,000 to settle a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by a photographer named Julie Dermansky, who alleged that Mr. Trump\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, used a photo she had taken of Trump supporters at a 2016 rally without her permission.The payment to Ms. Dermansky\u2019s lawyer was listed as being made on Aug. 2 \u2014 the same day the lawyer withdrew the lawsuit in a court filing indicating that \u201ca settlement has been reached between the parties.\u201dMs. Dermansky declined to comment on the case, referring questions to her lawyer, who did not respond to requests for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back Home, a Unanimous Verdict on Corker vs. Trump: That\u2019s Just Bob", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014 \u201cLiddle\u201d Bob Corker is kind of a big deal around here.They knew it in high school, when he swaggered into the student body presidency without having to campaign. They knew it in business, when locals could not turn their heads on many downtown streets for a time without encountering a building he owned.They knew it when he was mayor \u2014 more iconoclast technocrat than conservative crusader \u2014 with a habit of scooping up sidewalk trash, calling in potholes and staring up, nodding, at park-dwelling homeless men with grievances to air.And they know it now, on the occasion of a higher-profile confrontation: Mr. Corker, Tennessee\u2019s junior Republican senator, has become President Trump\u2019s chief congressional antagonist, warning of gross executive incompetence and a possible \u201cWorld War III\u201d in the most sweeping intraparty indictment yet of Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for office.The nation has seen a reliable Republican from a deep-red state stunningly undermining his president. Chattanooga has seen it coming, for better or worse.\u201cHe\u2019s certainly not a grandstander, has never been that,\u201d said Jon Kinsey, a Democrat, who preceded Mr. Corker as mayor. \u201cHe is simply saying what he thinks is the truth. That can be alarming.\u201dOn paper, Mr. Corker \u2014 a drawling 65-year-old deficit hawk who detests the Affordable Care Act and declined to oppose a single Trump cabinet nominee \u2014 might seem an unlikely candidate to send up warning signals about a Republican president, particularly one he has often supported behind the scenes.Those who know Mr. Corker best have viewed his unburdening as largely inevitable, the breaking point after a year of often pointed Trump critiques. Mr. Corker spoke out despite being one of the few establishment-aligned Republicans to develop a relationship with the president, who once weighed choosing him as secretary of state.For Mr. Corker, whose surest path to re-election would most likely have involved hugging the president tight, the decision not to run has removed any electoral constraint against full candor. The choice also spares him the potential threat of a difficult primary challenge from his right.All year, Mr. Corker has strained to maintain a careful balance. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he has forged close relationships with administration officials like Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state. And since last year, he and Mr. Trump had appeared to achieve something of a mutual respect themselves \u2014 the president finding in Mr. Corker another fortune-making builder and self-styled dealmaker in construction and real estate, who thrilled as much at the chase as at the profit.\u201cDo you think if we gave it back to them,\u201d Mr. Corker once asked an associate, Michael Compton, moments after buying two of the largest real estate companies in town, \u201cthey\u2019d let us try to buy it again?\u201dYet after wrestling with how thoroughly to lash a president whose temperament he had come to doubt (he did, during the spring, suggest that the White House was in a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d), Mr. Corker has turned to total bluntness, the logical extension of a professional life spent in near-permanent states of restlessness and cost-benefit analysis.The evening before he said he would not seek re-election, Mr. Corker held a fund-raiser near the Capitol. One by one, guests raised questions about the Republican agenda, and what could reasonably be accomplished in Congress. Repeal-and-replace? Entitlement reform?Not happening, Mr. Corker said on a loop.He did not linger at the event. The next morning, he stepped into his Senate office with news.The announcement went out that afternoon.Days later, Mr. Corker\u2019s other dilemma \u2014 how aggressively to lace into Mr. Trump \u2014 came into clearer view. He had set off on a risky investment, like the rest of the Republican Party, in standing with the president. He had labored furiously to make it work. And it was time, Mr. Corker concluded, to be honest about the dim returns.\u201cI thought he was extremely patient with President Trump,\u201d said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and Mr. Corker\u2019s friend and counterpart on the Foreign Relations Committee, \u201cknowing how quickly he can respond to absurdities.\u201dThis past week, Mr. Corker released a blueprint aimed at imposing an automatic return of sanctions if Iran was believed to be capable of producing a nuclear weapon within a year, or if it violated other restrictions. He worked with Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and a close administration ally, suggesting that his feud with the president will not undercut cooperation on this score.And if many Republicans \u2014 from fellow senators in his conference to zealous Trump supporters in his own state, which the president carried by more than 25 points last year \u2014 have questioned the wisdom of Mr. Corker\u2019s searing public remarks, his hometown has generally greeted the moment with a collective shrug.They know Bob Corker.\u201cSame person he\u2019s always been,\u201d said Brent Leatherwood, a former executive director of the Tennessee Republican Party.\u201cCorker\u2019s right,\u201d said Luke Morin, 76, a Trump voter and lifelong Chattanoogan who said he had socialized occasionally with Mr. Corker in the 1970s. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of turned against Trump now.\u201dAides to Mr. Corker, who was vacationing with his family in Florida, did not make him available for an interview.The son of a DuPont engineer, born in South Carolina and delivered to Chattanooga before seventh grade, Mr. Corker often seemed to prefer outdoor labor to classroom fare. He got a job collecting trash and lining off baseball fields, blossoming into a star (if undersize) player himself at his public high school.He also worked construction, taking quickly to the rhythms and tangibility of a job site and opting for a degree in industrial management at the University of Tennessee. After a stint as a construction superintendent, Mr. Corker put aside $8,000 to start his own company, settling into a career spent amassing a small fortune building shopping centers and later investing in higher-end real estate.Seven years later, the political itch first struck, when Mr. Corker unsuccessfully challenged Senator Bill Frist in a Republican primary. After his defeat, the governor at the time, Don Sundquist, another Republican, recruited Mr. Corker to Nashville as the state\u2019s commissioner of finance and administration, a job in which he helped bring the N.F.L.\u2019s Houston Oilers to Tennessee\u2019s capital.By 2001, after a brief return to business life, Mr. Corker hungered for a more public-facing role: mayor of his hometown, a long-fading manufacturing nexus where dismal air quality once compelled white-collar workers to pack a second shirt for the office to account for airborne soot stains.Though the opening of an aquarium in 1992 helped jump-start the city\u2019s revitalization, Mr. Corker is credited with seeing the task through, leading a push to overhaul the waterfront, develop a 1,200-acre industrial park that is now home to a Volkswagen assembly plant and helping to fashion Chattanooga \u2014 now nicknamed \u201cGig City\u201d \u2014 into a technology hub of the South.\u201cHe can\u2019t stand people operating at non-Corker speed,\u201d said Mr. Compton, who became his chief of staff in the mayor\u2019s office. An editorial cartoonist captured Mr. Corker\u2019s sartorial signature \u2014 a tie thrown over his shoulder \u2014 with a depiction of a Tasmanian devil-like governing blur with a tie tossed askew.After four years in the job, a bigger stage beckoned. With Mr. Frist, then the Senate majority leader, retiring, Mr. Corker sought the seat in one of the most-watched races of 2006, facing down Harold E. Ford Jr., a Democratic congressman from Memphis.Mr. Corker strained to distance himself from the spot, which was seen as an unsubtle bid to stir racial stereotypes about black men and white women as Mr. Ford tried to become the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction.In the race\u2019s final weeks, as Mr. Corker struggled to fight off his opponent, he phoned a top adviser, Tom Ingram.\u201cHe called me, just almost on a tirade,\u201d Mr. Ingram recalled. \u201cHe said: \u2018Man, I\u2019m tired of this. I may not be as good-looking, I may not be as smooth-talking, but I know the issues.\u2019\u201dWhen Mr. Corker was through, Mr. Ingram, who had been scribbling notes on the call, dialed another campaign hand with an update: Mr. Corker had, inadvertently, just written their closing ad for them.Since arriving in Washington, Mr. Corker has established himself as a dependably conservative but not overly partisan committee leader, eager to hold forth with reporters in the Senate bowels and occasionally grating on colleagues with his windiness and healthy self-regard in a chamber overstuffed with both. (Mr. Corker, a yoga enthusiast, is among the nimbler senators wending through the halls, though.)If his next move remains unclear, once his term expires, friends say he is likely to anchor himself back home \u2014 in a mansion guarded on a recent weekday by two non-fearsome dogs on the lawn; at a favorite Italian restaurant, Il Primo, where the hostess has promised \u201cUncle Bob\u201d a free limoncello pie on his next visit for confronting Mr. Trump; across a downtown that can skew almost bohemian in some patches, with a growing lot of Republicans joining the younger liberal demographic in questioning the president\u2019s abilities.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that is accurate,\u201d his Senate chief of staff, Todd Womack, marveled over hamburgers at Main Street Meats, scrolling through @realDonaldTrump\u2019s handiwork on Mr. Corker.But enough of that, he said, putting the phone away. The waterfront was just down the road.Mr. Womack returned to his car \u2014 with its backside sticker, \u201cBob Corker for U.S. Senate,\u201d nearly worn away for good \u2014 and invited his lunchmate to join him for a Chattanooga drive, to talk a little Bob Corker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Frightful Five Want to Rule Entertainment. They Are Hitting Limits.", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that\u2019s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline.Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing \u2014 in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches \u2014 are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit.This is the first of several columns in which I\u2019ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment \u2014 their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked.Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201dThe Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.There\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201dThis story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?It\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It\u2019s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Without Harvey Weinstein, Is There a Weinstein Company?", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A bicoastal staff meeting of the Weinstein Company was hastily convened late Thursday. Staff members were scared and shaken after public complaints of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein, the entertainment company\u2019s pugnacious co-founder. With the help of a video conferencing system, David Glasser, the Weinstein Company\u2019s president and chief operating officer, tried to rally the troops.\u201cWe are going to be O.K.,\u201d two people who attended the meeting recalled Mr. Glasser saying. He said his door was open to anyone who wanted to talk and encouraged everyone to stay focused on scheduled films.The movie and television company\u2019s other founder and co-chairman, Bob Weinstein, has a substantial track record running Dimension Films, a label dedicated to horror movies and family fare, like the \u201cSpy Kids\u201d franchise. Mr. Glasser, sometimes referred to in Hollywood as the third Weinstein brother, is an experienced executive. But Harvey Weinstein is the one who called \u2014 or screamed \u2014 the shots, often pushing the company forward by sheer force of will.\u201cWithout Harvey actively managing, the Weinstein Company will become even more capital constrained \u2014 tougher to find funding,\u201d Harold L. Vogel, a media analyst and the author of the book \u201cEntertainment Industry Economics,\u201d wrote in an email on Friday. Even without a crisis, Mr. Vogel noted, the studio\u2019s \u201cbusiness model doesn\u2019t function as well as it once did.\u201dThe Weinstein Company\u2019s board had a heated meeting on Thursday night. On Friday, three members of the board \u2014 Marc Lasry, Dirk Ziff and Tim Sarnoff \u2014 resigned, according to a board member and a company executive. In a statement, Bob Weinstein and three other board members said that a group of lawyers from Debevoise & Plimpton, including one with experience prosecuting sex crimes, would lead an investigation into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s behavior.\u201cAs Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNext steps will depend on Harvey\u2019s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the board\u2019s independent investigation and Harvey\u2019s own personal decisions.\u201dThe Weinstein brothers first came to prominence with Miramax in 1989, the year they helped to activate the indie-film boom with \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape.\u201d They sold Miramax to Disney in 1993 and left in 2005 to form the Weinstein Company. They unsuccessfully dabbled in side businesses, including a fashion label, but eventually found their film footing with releases like \u201cInglourious Basterds.\u201dSo far this year, the Weinstein Company, a boutique studio that specializes in sophisticated, small-budget dramas like the 2011 Oscar winner \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d has released six films, which have taken in a combined $123 million at the domestic box office. (The biggest hit has been \u201cWind River,\u201d a well-reviewed murder mystery that has collected about $33 million.) Last year, the Weinsteins had seven films, with combined ticket sales of just $65 million.To compare, major studios like Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Company generally take in $1 billion to $2.5 billion annually at the domestic box office.The Weinstein Company has also found itself sidelined at film festivals, where Mr. Weinstein has long shopped for movies to release, helping to discover auteurs like Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh. For years at the Sundance Film Festival, for instance, his wallet was the only one that mattered to agents, who would track his team relentlessly. Netflix and Amazon dominate now.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in his more recent diminished state, he remained a player, prodding a tiny, largely subtitled art film, \u201cLion,\u201d to six nominations this year. (The last time a Weinstein film was a force at the Oscars was in 2012, when \u201cThe Artist\u201d collected five awards, including best picture.)In this year\u2019s Oscars cycle, the company\u2019s big hopes are \u201cWind River\u201d and \u201cThe Current War,\u201d a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that is scheduled for a late November release. It received a tepid response at last month\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival, but Mr. Weinstein has personally helped to re-edit the movie since then.Several agents and producers said that, without Mr. Weinstein\u2019s all-or-nothing campaigning style, those films would probably be stranded on the awards trail.As the movie business has become more difficult, the Weinsteins have found success in television, especially the reality genre, with Heidi Klum\u2019s \u201cProject Runway.\u201d That series runs on Lifetime, a division of A&E Networks, and has spawned several spinoffs.Amazon, Showtime, A&E and Paramount all declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein on Friday or did not respond to queries. Ms. Klum, Mr. Sheridan and other people involved with Weinstein Company films and shows responded similarly.One prominent agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to draw his company into the controversy, said that he would advise female clients against withdrawing from Weinstein projects. He quickly added, however, that he would also tell them to ask for a contract saying that they would have zero contact with Harvey Weinstein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ben & Jerry\u2019s Strikes Deal to Improve Migrant Dairy Workers\u2019 Conditions", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat Ben & Jerry\u2019s did not have was a reliable way of ensuring that the dairy farms supplying it with milk were providing humane conditions for their workers, a major issue in an industry where many people work seven days a week for less than minimum wage.On Tuesday, the ice cream maker, which is based in Vermont, took a big step toward changing that, signing an agreement with a farmworkers\u2019 group that establishes labor standards for the company\u2019s suppliers in the state, and creates an enforcement strategy that encourages workers to speak up about violations.\u201cWe love to be part of innovation,\u201d said Jostein Solheim, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe believe in worker-led movements, and in bringing in dairy and doing it in Vermont.\u201dThe 1,200 to 1,500 workers in Vermont\u2019s dairy industry have been laboring under their own grim circumstances.\u201cOne of the biggest issues was housing conditions, the need for workers to be provided with basic amenities, like electricity, water, and housing that is free from pest infestations,\u201d said Enrique Balcazar, a former dairy worker who has helped lead the organizing effort, speaking through a translator.The workers tend to be undocumented, making it difficult for them to speak out.The agreement requires Ben & Jerry\u2019s to acquire its milk from farms that adhere to the standards. It will be enforced in part by the affected workers, who will be informed of their rights and encouraged to report violations to a 24-hour hotline.Compliance will be monitored by a group led by a former staff lawyer at the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Immigrant Justice Project, which will conduct audits. Ben & Jerry\u2019s will effectively finance the benefits by paying an undisclosed premium on the milk it buys, based on volume.Brendan O\u2019Neill, an organizer with Migrant Justice, praised the company.\u201cBy signing this agreement, Ben & Jerry\u2019s is prioritizing dairy workers as the most important ingredient in their ice cream,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said.\u201cWe don\u2019t see a huge gap in hard-core standards,\u201d Mr. Solheim said, \u201cbut we see an opportunity to make it work better.\u201dMigrant Justice began its campaign to improve conditions for immigrant farm workers in Vermont several years ago, not long after a worker died after getting tangled in a piece of machinery and being strangled by his own clothes.\u201cThese are real family businesses,\u201d Mr. Solheim said, describing what he saw as a big distinction between the agricultural industries in Vermont and Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s a different dynamic than what we have in a big produce area, where hundreds of people show up to harvest.\u201dThe program will be adopted in stages, with some standards, like prohibitions on sexual assault, forced labor and violence toward workers, taking effect immediately. Others, like raising pay to the minimum wage, will come more gradually. Farms must first go through an orientation, and workers must complete education sessions before Ben & Jerry\u2019s begins making the larger payments that will finance some of the benefits.The only necessary conditions, he said, were the buying power of major brands, which exert enormous leverage over suppliers, and worker participation, to define the needed rights and to help ensure compliance.Margaret Gray, an associate professor of political science at Adelphi University who has studied farm labor conditions, praised both the Fair Food Program and the Ben & Jerry\u2019s arrangement. But she warned that one force that made such programs effective, the power of corporate giants, could make it hard to extend their reach.\u201cIt\u2019s the corporations who tend to be making the most money, doing so at the expense of the workers, and at the expense of a lot of farmers,\u201d she said. They excel at \u201cfostering division between the two.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Philip Murphy, Key R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Entries Are Often Left Unspoken", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for Philip D. Murphy, the Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey, features two impressive entries: a 23-year tenure at Goldman Sachs, with high-ranking positions in Frankfurt and Hong Kong, and a four-year tenure under President Barack Obama as ambassador to Germany.But Mr. Murphy, who has a significant lead in recent polls, rarely talks about his two high-profile jobs.\u201cMy life\u2019s a book; I\u2019ve got a bunch of different chapters,\u201d he likes to say. But if that\u2019s the case, there are chapters he seems to want voters to skip.While Mr. Murphy, 60, has held other positions, including finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee and chairman of numerous nonprofits, his years at Goldman Sachs and as ambassador offer the broadest picture of the man who could occupy the governor\u2019s office in Trenton.Mr. Murphy, who lives in Red Bank and has four children, became ambassador in 2009, about six months after Mr. Obama was inaugurated, a delay that reportedly irked some German officials.The Times asked Philip D. Murphy, the Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey, to fill in the blanks in a letter to New Jerseyans.What also troubled the Germans, according to former American diplomats, was Mr. Murphy\u2019s lack of diplomatic experience, though he was familiar with the country because he had overseen Goldman Sachs\u2019s office there from 1993 to 1997.Mr. Murphy, however, was a fast study, according to Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, a former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council, who communicated regularly with the American embassy in Berlin. He traveled around the country and used his affinity for soccer to bond with German officials, she said.The cables also contained critical comments Mr. Murphy made about senior German officials. He called Chancellor Angela Merkel \u201cinsecure\u201d and referred to her as \u201cTeflon\u201d because of her penchant for avoiding political controversy.He described the foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, as \u201cincompetent, vain and critical of the United States.\u201dWithin diplomatic circles, many saw Mr. Murphy\u2019s remarks as common chatter in confidential cables. The German government, while publicly displaying irritation, never asked for another ambassador, according to former White House officials who would only discuss internal diplomatic matters on the condition of anonymity.\u201cThe thing with cables, they all carry the ambassador\u2019s name, but they aren\u2019t necessarily things he wrote,\u201d said Karen Donfried, a former official with the National Security Council. \u201cI remember it being a kerfuffle at the time, but I don\u2019t recall it as having lasting damage for him.\u201dIn some ways, the WikiLeaks crisis may have helped elevate Mr. Murphy\u2019s profile, making him a familiar face. Bild, Germany\u2019s highest-circulation tabloid, began featuring him as a boldfaced name spotted at upscale, celebrity-stocked parties. Photos appeared of Mr. Murphy and his wife, Tammy, on the red carpet at film festivals.\u201cIt was not a cakewalk in his time as ambassador and I thought he handled it extremely well,\u201d Ms. Donfried said.If Mr. Murphy\u2019s role as ambassador produced more public insights than he would have preferred, his long tenure at Goldman Sachs remains largely opaque. The investment firm\u2019s culture of secrecy makes many current and former employees reticent to talk in depth about colleagues or the company\u2019s inner workings.Mr. Murphy, who received an undergraduate degree from Harvard and a master\u2019s in business administration from the Wharton School of Business, began as an intern at Goldman Sachs in 1982, and was hired by the firm a year later. He rose quickly, eventually becoming head of Goldman Sachs Germany in Frankfurt, responsible for establishing a beachhead in a country that often preferred doing business with local banks.Mr. Murphy assembled a team and demanded that they all learn to speak German, even though banking business was mostly conducted in English. He played a key role in signing a major German client, Deutsche Telekom, and his success earned him a spot on the bank\u2019s lucrative managing committee.It also led him to Hong Kong, as president of Goldman Sachs Asia, where he helped secure $4.2 billion in underwriting for an initial public offering of China Telecom, which was considered a landmark achievement in the privatization of a Chinese national company on the international market.But deals made by Goldman Sachs under his watch in Asia also drew scrutiny. The firm had been working to take the state oil company, China National Petroleum Corp., public. But the oil company had international associations that ran afoul of American regulations, especially its dealing with the government of Sudan at the time of the genocide in Darfur.Mr. Murphy had left his role in Asia before the PetroChina initial public offering was finalized and his part in the deal remains murky. Peter Rose, a former senior manager at Goldman Sachs, said that Mr. Murphy was instrumental in \u201cstarting the process,\u201d but said he left his post in Asia before it moved forward.Henry M. Paulson, who was Goldman\u2019s chief operating officer at the time, also said \u201cI don\u2019t recall his involvement with the PetroChina I.P.O.\u201dAs the campaign for governor nears its end, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, the Republican, has used the deal involving PetroChina, as well as others, to attack Mr. Murphy, demanding he release his \u201cGoldman Sachs client list.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s campaign has declined to comment in any detail on his Goldman Sachs tenure. However, in a separate interview, he said his years at Goldman and as ambassador were assets.\u201cI see that this is a state in crisis and the economy is broken,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there are things that I learned while I was there that actually matter and are applicable to what we need to do in the state.\u201dMr. Rose, Mr. Paulson and other senior managers at Goldman Sachs, described Mr. Murphy\u2019s time at Goldman in the same way others described his performance as ambassador: highly energetic and engaged, skilled at leading conversation and public speaking.At Goldman, he was known to hold \u201cone conversation\u201d dinner parties at his house, orchestrating the discussion and calling on people to answer questions.Mr. Paulson recalled a time when he leaned on Mr. Murphy\u2019s public speaking ability and it did not go as planned.\u201cPhil is a terrific public speaker so after I had become the head of the investment banking division in 1990, I had Phil giving me some tips on delivery at the banquet after the year end conference,\u201d Mr. Paulson said. \u201cI am a teetotaler and Phil, who is not, left his glass of vodka next to my glass of water on the podium. When I mistakenly grabbed his glass to chug some water I thought I was going to die. And when I next opened my mouth to speak nothing came out.\u201dThose who worked with Mr. Murphy in Germany and Asia said he enjoyed socializing.\u201cThe holiday parties are legendary,\u201d Mr. Rose said, citing a costume party where he mingled with senior Goldman managers while dressed as Buzz Lightyear of \u201cToy Story.\u201dHe could not recall what Mr. Murphy wore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Middle East Feud Looms Over Jailing of Egyptian Woman", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Confined to a tiny windowless cell without a mattress or a toilet, denied visitors and held in solitary for months on end, Ola al-Qaradawi is being subjected to harsh treatment even by the grim standards of Egyptian prisons.Ms. Qaradawi, 55, was arrested in June when national security officers swooped in on her family\u2019s summer villa on the Mediterranean coast. Since then, her lawyers say, she has been denied the most basic privileges, and is allowed a single, five-minute bathroom break every morning.What crime merits such tough conditions is unclear. The Egyptian authorities have yet to formally charge Ms. Qaradawi, who works in an embassy and is a permanent American resident, or her husband, Hosam Khalaf, who is being held in similar conditions at a separate Cairo prison. State news media outlets say they are accused of belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood.\u201cA big part of this is about Qatar,\u201d said Aayah Khalaf, Ms. Qaradawi\u2019s daughter.Mr. Qaradawi is one of the Arab world\u2019s most popular televangelists. For years, his regular appearances on \u201cShariah and Life\u201d on Al Jazeera attracted tens of millions of viewers. His popularity stemmed from his folksy, religiously inflected guidance on a wide range of subjects, from oral sex and the morality of lottery cards to when it is acceptable to own a dog.Mr. Qaradawi, a longtime resident of Qatar, is less popular among Western governments: Britain, the United States and some European countries have refused him visas because of his pronouncements in favor of violent attacks on American soldiers in Iraq, and in favor of suicide bombings in Israel.In television terms the bespectacled cleric, 90, is a waning force: His last broadcast was about four years ago. But he still widely viewed as the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, and his presence in Qatar is a longstanding irritation for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Egypt stepped up its demand for Mr. Qaradawi\u2019s extradition as one condition for the lifting of the anti-Qatar boycott, shortly after it was imposed in early June. Qatar\u2019s leaders, who have a longstanding relationship with Mr. Qaradawi and have given him Qatari citizenship, refused to comply.Then, on June 30, Egyptian security forces seized his daughter and her husband, Mr. Khalaf, 58, at their vacation home on Egypt\u2019s Mediterranean coast. The security forces raided their Cairo apartment and confiscated money, jewelry and documents. In August, the authorities froze the couple\u2019s assets which, they said, were being used to finance the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201cIt is unbelievable that we are now living in the era of taking hostages from the families of opponents,\u201d Mostafa al-Naggar, a former lawmaker, wrote in a Facebook post.Ms. Qaradawi and her husband were already under official scrutiny before their arrest. Mr. Khalaf was imprisoned in 2014 for his ties to a small Islamist political party, and released without charge two years later. Ms. Qaradawi is employed as a researcher at the Qatari Embassy in Cairo.They hope their status as American residents, which they obtained last year, might help persuade the White House to take up their case. Although President Trump has hailed Mr. Sisi as a \u201cfantastic guy,\u201d his administration in August cut or withheld $291 million in aid in response to Mr. Sisi\u2019s woeful human rights record.Last spring, in one of his administration\u2019s most clear-cut foreign policy achievements, Mr. Trump helped secure the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American aid worker imprisoned in Egypt.But the Muslim Brotherhood, never popular in Washington, is an especially tough sell right now. Mr. Trump considered designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization this year, holding back only on the advice of intelligence officials and diplomats.Although he denies being a member of the Brotherhood, his sermons are hugely influential in Egypt, where Mr. Sisi\u2019s government has charged him with terrorism. Some sermons are tinged with sectarianism \u2014 he once said that Christians in Egypt have sided with the military and the West against the Brotherhood.The Egyptian prosecutor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Prospect Park, First the Goats, Then the Shrubbery", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorks in ProgressA black goat named Eyebrows and his sand-colored pals, Lily Belle and Swiss Cheese, lay sunbathing atop their wooden lean-to at the highest point of Prospect Park. Their job was done, their time in Brooklyn coming to an end.Having eaten much more than their weight in poison ivy and invasive species from the steep slopes of the park, the goats would soon be headed back to their farm upstate in Rhinebeck. Before the goats left in mid September, park workers enjoyed a group hug with them at Lookout Hill, their latest dining spot.But there was so much more work to be done. Now it was time for the humans to get busy.Across the park, at a woodland area called the Vale of Cashmere, a 26-foot-long truck had just parked. For two hours, a dozen soil-dusted, sweaty men and women from the Prospect Park Alliance formed a human chain that stretched down a small hill, passing tulip trees, elderberry plants, American holly and other potted native flora hand to hand to hand to hand. The plantings, when added to two other deliveries, would make up the new landscape on the sloped spot prepared by the goats earlier in summer.\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a naturalized woodland, but we\u2019re still keeping in mind the sightlines,\u201d said Mary Keehbauch, the forewoman of the crew, wiping sweat and dirt from her face with a bandanna and surveying the sea of new trees she had ordered. \u201cSo many plantings. And we\u2019re not even all in yet.\u201dThe project \u2014 from goats to planting \u2014 is part of a woodland reclamation following the destruction of the area by Hurricane Sandy and other storms over the last few years. The Vale of Cashmere alone lost 50 trees to Sandy. \u201cThat was a section that was almost like a blow down,\u201d said the chief landscape architect, Christian Zimmerman.\u201cThey were big mature trees,\u201d Sue Donoghue, president of the alliance, said. \u201cIt was devastating.\u201d She pointed to a patch of blue sky through the treetops. \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in the canopy,\u201d she added. More than 500 trees were lost or damaged by Sandy parkwide.But the restoration was underway, at least in the northeast corner of the park. Standing at the back of his truck, John Panacek was drenched in sweat, as he helped unload the 1,658 shrubs and trees he had delivered from Pinelands Nursery in Columbia, N.J. \u201cThe end is near!\u201d Mr. Panacek, who is 6-foot-6 and is known as Big John, yelled as he emerged from the back of the truck around 9 a.m.A few minutes later, the last of the haul was unloaded, the rows of plants standing at attention in the sun, waiting to be planted.That morning\u2019s shipment was the second of three. In all there would be 1,821 trees, 2,168 shrubs, 887 ferns and 16,993 herbaceous plugs. Planting at the one-and-a-half acre site \u2013 done both by hand and auger (a planting drill) \u2014 began last week and will stretch through the end of the month.Back in the 1970s and \u201980s, because of city budget cuts, the park\u2019s woodlands suffered from neglect. Native trees and plants were overtaken by invasive species, and the balance of understory and overstory growth, which make a forest strong, was lost. So when Sandy and other storms hit, the toll in trees was great. But it left a blank slate for rebuilding some of the woodlands. The non-profit alliance, started in 1987, has been working on woodland renewal for years, planting 500,000 trees, plants and shrubs since 1990 at a total cost of $15 million. For its latest woodlands project, including not just the Vale of Cashmere but also Lookout Hill, they received $1.2 million in financing from the National Park Service through Hurricane Sandy disaster relief grants.The new plantings will help make the woodlands more resilient in future storms. Invasive species like English ivy, Japanese honeysuckle, Norway maples and sycamore maples will be replaced with black oak, dogwood, spicebush and native ferns.Work at the Vale of Cashmere started in the spring of 2016 by a large team of goats. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure how many goats we would need, so we started with eight,\u201d said Mr. Zimmerman. \u201cThen went down to six and then four.\u201d\u201cThey were very productive,\u201d said Mr. Zimmerman, smiling.Eyebrows, a Nubian goat, Lily Belle, a Nigerian Dwarf goat, and Swiss Cheese, an Alpine goat, have four stomachs each and eat 25 percent of their body weight each day on the park\u2019s steep hillsides. (The fourth goat, Horatio, also a Nubian, was sent home over the summer when he developed a rash.)A season of goat rental cost $15,000. They are great climbers and are an environmentally safe approach to clearing the land, said Ms. Donoghue. Roundup herbicide \u2013 a cheaper, faster solution \u2013 is sometimes used in projects like this, but the Alliance went with the goats instead. And they were also very popular with park visitors.They ate the invasive species down to their roots, forcing the plants to use all their energy to grow new shoots, only to be eaten again and again, Mr. Zimmerman explained. The plants grow back smaller and smaller, until they don\u2019t have the energy to grow back anymore.Next year, the goat-cleared area near Lookout Hill will be planted with new shrubs and trees as well.\u201cIt\u2019s all about shoring up and strengthening,\u201d said Ms. Donoghue, pointing to the trees, \u201cand giving this the optimal chance to survive.\u201dThe ParticularsProject: Vale of Cashmere woodlands restorationSite: Northeast corner of Prospect Park in BrooklynCost: $727,970, from a New York State parks grantIn the works: Since 2016Driving Force: Prospect Park AllianceBiggest obstacle: Pesky invasive plant speciesAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hopes Dim for Congressional Russia Inquiries as Parties Clash", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a secured room in the basement of the Capitol in July, Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, fielded question after question from members of the House Intelligence Committee. Though the allotted time for the grilling had expired, he offered to stick around as long as they wanted.The exchange, described by three people with knowledge of it, typified the political morass that is crippling the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election \u2014 and whether the Trump campaign colluded in any way.But the problems extend beyond that panel. All three committees looking into Russian interference \u2014 one in the House, two in the Senate \u2014 have run into problems, from insufficient staffing to fights over when the committees should wrap up their investigations. The Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s inquiry has barely started, delayed in part by negotiations over the scope of the investigation. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, while maintaining bipartisan comity, have sought to tamp down expectations about what they might find.Nine months into the Trump administration, any notion that Capitol Hill would provide a comprehensive, authoritative and bipartisan accounting of the extraordinary efforts of a hostile power to disrupt American democracy appears to be dwindling.\u201cCongressional investigations unfortunately are usually overtly political investigations, where it is to one side\u2019s advantage to drag things out,\u201d said Mr. Gowdy, who made his name in Congress as a fearsome investigator of Democrats. He added, \u201cThe notion that one side is playing the part of defense attorney and that the other side is just these white hat defenders of the truth is laughable.\u201dInstead, he said, he is looking to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to conduct an apolitical investigation.But all three are up against a ticking clock, with Republicans in both chambers eager to wrap up the investigations before too long.Particularly in the House, partisan fighting is likely to undermine whatever conclusions the committee reaches. One lawmaker said the committee would probably produce two reports. The first, written by Republicans, is expected to forcefully say there is no proof that anyone around Mr. Trump worked with Russia to tip the election. A Democratic report will probably raise unanswered questions and say that the committee was never fully committed to answering them.Mr. Nunes handed control to three of the committee\u2019s Republicans, Representatives K. Michael Conaway of Texas, Tom Rooney of Florida and Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Conaway, a well-liked accountant, helped put the investigation back on track and has maintained a productive relationship with Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the panel\u2019s top Democrat.\u201cFrankly, I have been doing everything I can to try to get us to do a credible investigation and to reach a common conclusion,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cI view these things as obstacles that are in the way to overcome, and I am doing my best to overcome them almost daily.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not reply to a request for comment.Democrats were also incensed by Mr. Gowdy\u2019s remarks to Mr. Kushner in July, which they said were representative of efforts by some Republicans to cut the investigation short. Shortly after the meeting, Mr. Schiff publicly accused Mr. Gowdy of playing defense attorney for the administration.Republicans have returned the biting words, sharply criticizing Mr. Schiff, whose frequent television appearances irk them. Mr. Rooney used a vulgarity when he called Mr. Schiff\u2019s comments about the Kushner interview nonsense. And Mr. Gowdy said on Friday that he had been compelled to weigh in by the Democrats\u2019 repetitive and meandering questions \u2014 and that a transcript would show his own questions to have been appropriately aggressive.The Republican said it had become clear where the committee was headed.\u201cWill our private conclusions be the same? Yes,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said. \u201cWill our public pronouncements be the same? No, of course not.\u201d\u201cThis is politics,\u201d he added.Across Capitol Hill, the tone has been different. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and its top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia, have worked to project a collaborative rapport that committee members insist is real.\u201cAt the end of the day, what we owe the American people is the truth,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s something there, then they should know that. And if there\u2019s not something there, I\u2019ll be the first to acknowledge that.\u201d\u201cThe special counsel is focused on criminal acts; we\u2019re not focused on criminal acts,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we find one, then they\u2019re the first phone call we make.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no proof yet that it\u2019s happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the ability to use a grand jury. He\u2019s got the ability to use the power of subpoena without question. And he\u2019s got the ability to do a criminal investigation.\u201dBoth intelligence committees will also face questions about how much of what they find can be declassified and shared with the public. Mr. Burr said on Wednesday that his goal was to have the \u201cmeat of our business\u201d done by late spring, in time for state governments to make changes to their voting systems before next year\u2019s midterm elections. He said he would push to declassify the findings as much as possible.Mr. Grassley has spent weeks negotiating with the Justice Department on the committee\u2019s behalf to try to gain access to two key F.B.I. officials who worked closely with Mr. Comey, Carl Ghattas and James Rybicki. Hopes of interviewing Paul J. Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, collapsed over the summer after prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller warned Mr. Manafort that they planned to seek criminal charges against him.On Wednesday, Mr. Grassley unilaterally sent a flurry of letters requesting interviews with and information from current and former Justice Department officials, as well as Mr. Kushner and others involved in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer said to be offering incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton.Senators said they were still hopeful that the committee would break through the logjam, but a deal had not been reached as of Friday.\u201cThe American people deserve a public investigation,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, noting that the Judiciary Committee could work more publicly than the intelligence panels. \u201cThey deserve witnesses who will give an accounting in public under oath.\u201dReporting was contributed by Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldman, Mark Mazzetti, Matthew Rosenberg and Sharon LaFraniere.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rockwell\u2019s Children Sue Berkshire Museum to Stop Sale of His Works", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the Berkshire Museum in Western Massachusetts has struggled financially as companies have left the region and competing art institutions have sprung up nearby.In July, museum officials announced a plan to reinvent it, placing a greater emphasis on science and history. To help pay for the changes and create an endowment, they said, the museum plans to auction off 40 works of art \u2014 including two paintings by Norman Rockwell that the renowned artist had donated to the institution \u2014 for about $50 million.There is, however, notable resistance to this plan. On Friday, a group that includes Rockwell\u2019s three children filed papers asking a Massachusetts judge to stop the museum, which was established in 1903 in Pittsfield, Mass., from selling the artwork.The plaintiffs, who also include a local artist and several members of the museum, argue that the institution\u2019s trustees have \u201cgrossly exaggerated\u201d its financial straits and that selling the works would represent a \u201cmassive overkill\u201d and breach of their fiduciary duties.They also argue that selling the art would violate the statute that established the museum, which requires it to maintain any gifts it receives for \u201cthe people of Berkshire County and the general public.\u201d\u201cThis move is also antithetical to the museum\u2019s stated charitable purpose, and is financially unnecessary,\u201d Michael B. Keating, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement.Lawyers for the plaintiffs have asked for a temporary restraining order to halt the auctions, which are to be handled by Sotheby\u2019s. The two paintings by Norman Rockwell, the most valuable among the works for sale, are scheduled to be offered on Nov. 13. Nineteen works are set to be auctioned by March, with others to follow.In a statement late Friday, William F. Lee, a lawyer for the Berkshire Museum, said, \u201cWe are confident that the museum has the right to go forward and that the lawsuit is factually and legally flawed.\u201dMaura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, is also named in the lawsuit as a so-called necessary party because it is her office\u2019s job to oversee public charities like the museum.Emily Snyder, a spokeswoman for Ms. Healey, said her office \u201chas been closely reviewing\u201d whether there are restrictions on the museum\u2019s ability to sell the art, and that it would also review Friday\u2019s filings.In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Keating acknowledged that the museum had the right to deaccession works for various reasons, but he emphasized that trustees \u201cmust do it in a way that is fiduciarily responsible.\u201d He argued that they had failed.Museum officials, however, have insisted that it must evolve into an \u201cinnovative 21st-century institution.\u201d They have said that the works they selected for deaccession are \u201cnot essential to the museum\u2019s refreshed mission.\u201dIn a statement to The New York Times on Friday, Elizabeth McGraw, president of the museum\u2019s board of trustees, said the \u201cNew Vision\u201d plan would \u201callow this important local museum to continue to contribute to the educational and cultural life of this region for another century.\u201dThe way museum officials see it, the next century\u2019s visitors will not need to see certain works by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, \u00c9douard Vuillard and Rockwell. The two Rockwell paintings, \u201cShuffleton\u2019s Barbershop\u201d \u2014 which plaintiffs say is considered to be his finest work \u2014 and \u201cBlacksmith\u2019s Boy \u2014 Heel and Toe (Shaftsbury Blacksmith Shop),\u201d are expected to bring up to $30 million and $10 million, respectively.Court documents say Mr. Rockwell was a longtime resident of Berkshire County who befriended a director of the museum; he donated the two paintings in 1958 and 1966 and died in 1978.\u201cNorman Rockwell didn\u2019t give it to finance the museum\u2019s renovation plans,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHe gave it hoping the people of the Berkshires would see it and enjoy it. By auctioning off his gift, the Berkshire Museum risks the painting being lost to a private collector who won\u2019t share the painting with the public.\u201cThat,\u201d they added, \u201cwould be a great loss.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats, Seeking to Disavow Weinstein, Plan to Give His Donations to Charity", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts each said they would transfer money to charity in amounts equal to donations they had received from Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Leahy was planning to donate $5,600, Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Heinrich $5,400 and Ms. Warren $5,000. Some of them were planning to give to groups that advocate for women who are the victims of domestic violence.With the four senators ridding themselves of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s contributions, other Democratic lawmakers were expected to follow suit on Friday in order to mitigate a deeply embarrassing story.Mr. Weinstein has for decades been a generous contributor to liberal candidates and causes, and in recent years has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to some of the most prominent Democrats in the country, including five-figure sums to President Barack Obama and to Hillary Clinton, the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee.Mr. Weinstein has been a fixture at Democratic fund-raisers on both coasts in every recent presidential campaign and has helped gather checks for candidates from others in the entertainment industry.Last October, for example, Mr. Weinstein co-produced a Broadway fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign that was headlined by former President Bill Clinton, her husband, and Chelsea Clinton, her daughter, and featured dozens of performing artists.But he went from being a coveted contributor to a pariah almost immediately on Thursday afternoon after The New York Times posted an article revealing that allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretched back nearly three decades.He issued an apology and said he was \u201ctrying to do better.\u201d\u201cIf the Democratic Party purports itself to be the champion of women, they ought to lead by example in returning or donating the donations received from Harvey Weinstein,\u201d said Alexandra Smith, who runs America Rising PAC, a Republican opposition research group.Ms. Smith\u2019s group noted that Mr. Weinstein had donated more than $300,000 to Democrats in the past six years. Nearly $100,000 of that money went to the Democratic National Committee, which has struggled to raise funds since Mr. Trump took office, and more than $20,000 went to the House Democratic campaign arm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the E.U.\u2019s Weakest Link Hold?", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS Relations between the countries with the European Union\u2019s strongest economy and its most troubled one have been testy at times, but the bond has held. Yet just when it needs strengthening, the link between Germany and Greece may be at risk of fraying further.During Greece\u2019s debt crisis, angry exchanges in the Greek and German news media and populist rhetoric on both sides encouraged national stereotyping, affecting each country\u2019s domestic politics and relations between them. But the need for Germany and other countries to support Greece also prompted moves toward closer union in Europe. Passions in Greece seem to be abating, but now Germany is in danger of being swayed by simplistic narratives \u2014 at potential cost to Greece and the European Union.Failure to keep the eurozone intact would be a disaster \u2014 in economic and human terms for Greece, and as proof that the political will to protect the European project is lacking.In Greece, the political center fragmented, to the benefit of formerly marginal extremist groups that have exploited public anger without solving the problems that cause it. This has hindered the consensus needed for recovery. Germany\u2019s recent elections suggest that the combustible mix of political passions and simplistic economic narratives has taken center stage there, too.Greece\u2019s economic problems triggered the European Union\u2019s first major crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was in favor of Greece remaining in the eurozone but made a point of not making things easy for Athens. This was ostensibly to avoid moral hazard, but perhaps more to appease critics at home. Now, with her conservative party having won the elections by a reduced majority, she is likely to be under pressure to make things even harder for Greece.The irony is that until recently, it was Greek politicians who railed loudest against the bailouts, with opposition parties branding governments as sellouts for signing on to reforms and austerity in exchange for loans. The present government \u2014 a coalition of the radical left and nationalist right \u2014 came to power in early 2015 on an anti-austerity, frequently anti-German platform. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras demanded support with no strings attached.When Greece\u2019s partners and creditors called his bluff, the country defaulted on a payment to the International Monetary Fund and was on the brink of exiting the eurozone when Mr. Tsipras signed on to a new bailout agreement with even tougher terms. Forced to abandon his radical policy, he came to rely on the German chancellor for support and understanding. But his brinkmanship undermined earlier efforts and pushed Greece back into recession. The country is still trying to pull itself together, with the economy showing modest growth this year.Now it is German politicians who threaten to derail the relationship that held the eurozone together. Even before the Sept. 24 election, the surge in support for the extreme-right-wing Alternative for Germany party had skewed the country\u2019s politics, with members of other parties echoing some of its demands, including opposition to the eurozone and to support for Greece.In trying to forge a governing coalition, Ms. Merkel will have to reconcile contradictory policies among potential partners and placate critics within her own party. The Free Democrats, who are likely partners, advocate a hard line on Greece. Recently, the party leader, Christian Lindner, accused the soon-to-be-former finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who had repeatedly proposed that Greece leave the eurozone (at least temporarily), of being too soft. Mr. Lindner is in a position to demand commitments that there be no debt relief for Greece and that Germany maintain a strict fiscal policy with regard to Europe.This is a difficult time for liberal democracy. The threat to the European Union and its principles demands a stronger union, as the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, has stressed. The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, refers to the need for social values that go beyond the concerns of the single market and the eurozone.Over the past few years, Ms. Merkel has agreed to move toward closer union. This was not so clear at the start of the crisis. In 2010, there was no centralized fund to rescue Greece. The system that was adopted, mainly at Germany\u2019s insistence, involved eurozone countries making bilateral loans to Greece; its terms were punitive, and it also made taxpayers in donor countries keenly aware that their money was going toward bailing out the Greeks rather than protecting the common currency.This caused lasting suspicion of Greece in many countries. It kept the focus on national interests rather than encouraging confidence in the European whole. The immigration crisis magnified this, with several countries breaking ranks with the European Union\u2019s policy, erecting walls and refusing to accept their quota of refugees, choosing their own perceived interests over the bloc\u2019s principles.The eurozone now has the institutions and procedures to cope with economic emergencies. It dealt with crises in Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus without provoking turmoil similar to that in Greece or inciting anger in donor countries. The European Central Bank \u2014 despite German protestations \u2014 plays a more active role defending the euro and member states than it did in 2010. As long as Greece remains in bailout limbo, however, it is shut out of the E.C.B.\u2019s bond-buying program, which would give Greek banks greater liquidity and improve confidence in the economy.It is no surprise that populists have made gains in Germany. But they still account for a small percentage of voters and should not be allowed a disproportionate say in national policy. There is too much at stake. In Greece, we saw what happens when politicians with slogans rather than serious proposals dominate the scene. In Greece, though, it is the Greeks who pay for their mistakes. The world cannot afford for Germans to make the same mistake.If Germany is kept from working toward European unity, this will mark a lack of leadership of historic consequences. If the European Union\u2019s weakest link cannot hold, the union may fall apart. If nations allow irresponsible minorities to dictate policy and sow division, what will keep them, too, from falling apart?Nikos Konstandaras is a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini.Advertisement"}

Tillerson made an impassioned plea on Wednesday for closer ties with India while casting China as a threat to the world order and saying Pakistan needed to do more to fight terrorism.The pro-India tone of his speech, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, was clear when Mr. Tillerson began by wishing everyone a \u201cHappy Diwali,\u201d a reference to the fall Hindu festival of lights that is often marked by fireworks displays.But he asked the audience to refrain from lighting any.\u201cI don\u2019t need any fireworks,\u201d he said to audible chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m getting too many fireworks around me already.\u201dBut top American officials have been calling for closer ties with India for most of India\u2019s seven decades as an independent nation, and little was new about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s calls for improved military and economic relations between the two.\u201cThe Trump administration is determined to dramatically deepen ways for the United States and India to further this partnership,\u201d he said.What was unusual, though, was that Mr. Tillerson felt the need to emphasize how much more the United States likes India than it does China and, to a lesser extent, Pakistan.\u201cChina, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly, at times undermining the international, rules-based order even as countries like India operate within a framework that protects other nations\u2019 sovereignty,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cChina\u2019s provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for.\u201dHe was less critical of Pakistan, but his spare remarks \u2014 only three sentences in a 20-minute speech \u2014 made clear that the country would not get the affection its neighbor received.\u201cWe expect Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based within their own borders that threaten their own people and the broader region,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.Mr. Tillerson is expected to visit New Delhi and Islamabad, Pakistan\u2019s capital, next week.As it has formulated its strategy for hot spots around the world, the Trump administration has emphasized that it looks at problems with a wider lens than its predecessors did \u2014 making decisions about troop levels in Afghanistan, for instance, dependent on a regional approach. So what goes up in India \u2014 meaning ties with the United States \u2014 seems to be headed down elsewhere.Mr. Tillerson\u2019s sharply critical remarks about China are the latest in what has been an almost bipolar attitude toward the country. Mr. Trump excoriated China during his campaign, but after assuming office, he expressed great respect for its president, Xi Jinping, saying that the United States was depending on China to rein in North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions.And even as Chinese leaders have made clear that they will not or cannot resolve the North Korean crisis, Mr. Trump has continued to treat Beijing gently, imposing none of the trade and currency sanctions he promised.China experts have been predicting for months that mutual disappointment was inevitable. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s speech suggested that moment may have arrived, at least at the State Department.In a question-and-answer session after his speech, Mr. Tillerson even criticized the way China invested in its neighbors, saying infrastructure projects that it financed brought few local jobs and saddled countries with enormous debt.Mr. Tillerson also briefly touched on the plight of the Rohingya in Myanmar.Myanmar\u2019s government must allow improved access to the area for aid agencies, he said.\u201cThe world just can\u2019t stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in the area,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

(For the sake of comparison, a highly produced minute of programming on YouTube might cost $10,000.) And he wants to attract A-list talent both in front of and behind the camera. That\u2019s one reason the financing ask is so high: Hollywood heavyweights cannot be convinced to do 10-minute video snippets unless they are paid what they are accustomed to being paid.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s hunch about the way a huge swath of consumers will watch television in the future is, in all likelihood, right. The number of teenagers and young adults who have their nose pressed to their mobile devices watching video content is startling. Globally, 72 percent of all video is viewed on a mobile device, according to Ooyala, a video platform provider.The question is whether his idea is ahead of its time. And whether he can find the right business model to support such expensive programing.Mr. Katzenberg is a realist. \u201cWe need $2 billion. That\u2019s a high bar,\u201d he said. And he acknowledges that the financial details still need to be worked out. It\u2019s daunting. He needs to build an instant library of content \u2014 and a big one.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s gamble is being taken seriously because of his long history of success and his provocative thesis about the current television model. \u201cThe design and the architecture of the storytelling fit the business paradigm, not the other way around,\u201d he explained, suggesting that shows were made in the format of a half-hour or an hour for business reasons and do not make sense in the world of mobile devices and streaming.He also took a shot at all the advertising on network programs. \u201cI would actually make the argument that one of the challenges for network TV has been that they\u2019ve actually busted the form by asking people to watch 19 minutes of commercial time inside of 60 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-two percent of your watch time is watching commercials.\u201dInstead, Mr. Katzenberg is hoping to create a premium network that will probably rely on a combination of subscription fees and advertising \u2014 \u00e0 la Spotify. He does not believe he will put television companies out of business; in fact, he needs them as partners and believes they can live side by side.But Mr. Katzenberg does not want to simply create a studio that specializes in short-form storytelling; he wants to create a platform for it. He is hoping that many of the big television networks both invest and produce content for the service.\u201cThis is literally a true moment in time here in which we\u2019re going to create a new form, a new format, a new platform, new content and we\u2019re going to supply that content and we\u2019re going to let them,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg said of the big networks, \u201cgrab what ultimately will be the biggest value here by owning the platform.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve all grown up with this idea that content is king,\u201d he said, explaining his rationale for trying to create a new service rather than simply creating the content itself. \u201cAnd I realized, it actually isn\u2019t. Content is the king maker, it\u2019s not the king. The king is the platform. HBO is the king. Netflix is the king. Spotify is the king.\u201dWhen I mentioned to Mr. Katzenberg that well-heeled competitors like Apple and Facebook are getting into the television business and may seek to innovate the form, he was unfazed.\u201cThis idea that Apple and Facebook and YouTube are now coming into Hollywood with these billions of dollars and are in fact going to change the enterprise of television is actually wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything new or different or unique. It simply broadens the offering and it may broaden the destinations that you can go to, but in fact that fragmentation at some point is going to implode.\u201dMr. Katzenberg believes he is offering something that will start the next leg of growth in the industry.Executives who have seen Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s plan, including Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, and Leslie Moonves of CBS, have expressed enthusiasm for the project.Still, there are skeptics. Several media executives pointed to Nielsen data showing that traditional television still accounts for the bulk of the video viewing among people over 18 years old in the United States. (The country is far behind other nations in video mobile viewing.)And of course there is the question of what kind of content consumers want to watch on a phone. So far, most short-form content has been relatively cheap to produce, because of lower production quality, and customers have willingly watched it. Who\u2019s to say they are craving HBO-level production quality? And many viewers are happy to watch Netflix on a mobile device and press pause on their favorite show or movie and return to it later.But Mr. Katzenberg says that to think about it like that is backward. There is always an opportunity to create a premium product, he said, and there will be \u201ca pretty meaningful subset of people who would actually pay for it.\u201dTo Mr. Katzenberg, the idea is too obvious not to pursue. \u201cYou have an installed base of one and a half billion people who watch 45 minutes of video on a smartphone every day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is where I say to you, \u2018They\u2019re drinking water. We\u2019re going to give it to them in a bottle.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Epic, and Costly, Boardroom Battle at Procter & Gamble", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorporate board elections are usually dull affairs best left to investor newsletters and government filings.But the battle between Procter & Gamble and the activist investor Nelson Peltz, who is seeking a seat on the company\u2019s board, has the hallmarks of a heated political campaign: eye-popping amounts of spending, acrimonious exchanges and aggressive grass-roots lobbying of the small shareholders whose votes are normally meaningless but, in this case, may have an outsize effect on the result.It\u2019s the biggest corporate proxy fight in history and also staggeringly expensive; the two sides will have spent at least $60 million, and probably tens of millions more, as they try to sway investors to their point of view.Shareholders say they are being inundated with mailings, phone calls and outreaches on social media platforms featuring sleekly produced websites and videos.Of course, the vote on Tuesday at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Cincinnati is about much more than Mr. Peltz\u2019s quest to gain a single seat on Procter & Gamble\u2019s board.It is a referendum on the leadership of a $235 billion company as its stock has languished, underperforming its peers in the last decade. The outcome could affect the future course of the 180-year-old corporation, which has more than $65 billion in annual revenue and is home to familiar household brands like Tide and Pampers.The proxy war is also a warning shot to blue-chip companies across the country that activist investors are setting their sights on ever-bigger corporate targets as they agitate for changes in strategy and structure. This year, General Motors and Tiffany & Company found themselves targeted by activists.\u201cNo company is off limits because of its size, industry, the complexity of its business or even its stock price performance,\u201d as activist investors control larger sums of assets, said Damien Park, a managing director at Spotlight Advisors, which advises companies and investors on activism.Indeed, in recent years, through his investment firm Trian Fund Management, Mr. Peltz, 75, has taken significant stakes in H. J. Heinz, Mondelez International and DuPont. Sometimes, but not always, he has been given representation on the board.This time around, Procter & Gamble is fighting Mr. Peltz\u2019s attempt to get a seat, saying he is a late arrival to a corporate turnaround that is already underway.Mr. Peltz, who owns a $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble, has said he is not looking to oust any board members or the chief executive, David Taylor. If he wins a seat, he hopes to convince the other directors, including Kenneth Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, and Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, that the company should be organized from its current multilevel \u201cmatrix\u201d structure to three clear global business units to improve accountability. He also contends that a study should be conducted to understand why Procter & Gamble\u2019s once-vaunted innovation machine appears to have stalled.\u201cThis is different from the normal activist slate, which is seeking to replace much of the board or the C.E.O.,\u2019\u2019 said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cHere, he\u2019s simply seeking input into the board process. He seeks a change of direction and I think he\u2019s right. I think the company has stalled.\u201dIn the last decade, Procter & Gamble\u2019s total return \u2014 stock performance plus reinvested dividends \u2014 was around 77 percent. That is about half the returns for peers like Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive.Procter & Gamble argues that Mr. Peltz is not providing any new ideas. The company\u2019s management, including its board and Mr. Taylor, a longtime Procter & Gamble veteran who was named chief executive nearly two years ago, has already identified the changes that need to be made and is in the midst of making them, it argues.Furthermore, the company says its plan is yielding results, noting that it has delivered total shareholder return of 28 percent since Mr. Taylor took over, outperforming its peers.The company also argues that Mr. Peltz lacks the criteria that it seeks for its directors, noting that it is now looking for leaders with digital and \u201cbig data/analytics\u201d experience, skills in artificial intelligence and direct experience in household and personal categories. The board added in a statement on Friday that Mr. Peltz\u2019s push to reorganize the company into global units was a \u201cbad idea\u201d that would only stall its momentum.Still, Mr. Peltz\u2019s arguments were striking a chord with some investors. Late last week, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which invests in Trian funds and controls 5.6 million shares of Procter & Gamble, said it was throwing its vote to Mr. Peltz. Earlier, the three largest proxy advisory firms also gave their support to him, an important victory because many institutional investors vote their shares based on the firms\u2019 recommendations.But a crucial piece of this battle sits with smaller so-called retail shareholders who control 40 percent of Procter & Gamble\u2019s stock and may have emotional ties to the company.Many of them are retirees who were given shares over the years as part of the company\u2019s profit-sharing plan. But some stock is held by individuals who inherited it.\u201cGrandpa or their dad worked there and you\u2019re not supposed to sell the P.&G. stock,\u201d said John Lame, a former finance manager for Procter & Gamble who now runs the financial advisory firm Lenox Wealth Management in Cincinnati. Among his clients are the families of 150 current and former Procter & Gamble employees and executives.\u201cPeople have been very loyal to the stock and the company,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cA lot of those people are going to vote with management.\u201dIt has been the effort to reach out to this sizable retail base that has ramped up the costs of this campaign. In regulatory filings, the two sides said they had over 600 people working on the board election, and they expected to spend $60 million, combined.But according to interviews with former executives, analysts and observers who are closely monitoring the battle, the cost, when all is said and done, will very likely be closer to $100 million. Mr. Peltz has accused P.&G. of spending $100 million to keep him off the board.\u201cThe communications have been voluminous,\u201d said Jim Langendonk, 66, of Slidell, La., who retired from Procter & Gamble in 2010 after working for 25 years in information technology. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten eight to 10 voting forms from both sides. Almost too many to count, and they just keep on coming.\u201dMr. Langendonk said he intended to vote for Procter & Gamble in the proxy fight. \u201cTypically, what guys like Peltz do is try to break up the company or load it up with a bunch of debt,\u201d said Mr. Langendonk. \u201cThat\u2019s my biggest concern: that he\u2019ll ruin a really good company.\u201dBut others wonder, what\u2019s the harm in adding a different voice to the board?\u201cThe restructuring at P.&G. has been going on for 20 years. That\u2019s a long time without much to show for it,\u201d said Mr. Lame, who estimates that the company\u2019s underperformance relative to its category has cost his clients $200 million over the last 10 years. \u201cMaybe you need to have one person on the board who has a different point of view.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Unrest Threatens Spain\u2019s Return to Economic Vigor", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Those inclined to the view that no price can be placed on freedom have presumably missed the action in the Spanish bond market.As a result, Spain now finds itself having to pay slightly higher premiums to persuade investors to buy its debt. That is likely to translate into higher borrowing costs for Spanish banks, and less credit for Spanish businesses and households, depriving the economy of fuel.Increased borrowing costs were showing no signs of spilling into Italy, Portugal or other regional economies on Friday. The euro \u2014 seemingly never far from danger \u2014 was, at least for the time being, spared fresh crisis.But banks based in Catalonia, which suffered plunges in their share prices following the independence referendum, have been exploring plans to shift their headquarters to other parts of Spain. The possibility that Catalonia might declare independence has left those banks vulnerable to being severed from Spain and \u2014 by extension \u2014 the European Union and the bloc of nations that uses the euro currency.Such isolation would put at risk the banks\u2019 ability to transact with clients across the Continent and to tap the largess of European institutions should another crisis emerge.On Thursday, the board of one bank, Banco Sabadell, approved the transfer of the lender\u2019s headquarters to Alicante, a city on the Mediterranean, 330 miles south of Barcelona, and a place in no danger of ceasing to be part of Spain. By the end of the day, Sabadell\u2019s stock had surged more than 6 percent.On Friday, the Spanish government decreed a legal change giving firms the right to move their headquarters without having to win the approval of shareholders. Soon, CaixaBank convened its board, agreeing on Friday evening to move from Barcelona to Valencia \u2014 another city solidly within Spain.In other industries, like textiles, telecommunications and energy, companies have in recent days made similar moves. All were seemingly intent on foreclosing the possibility of landing in a state of crippling purgatory if Catalonia became independent.\u201cWe have just gotten through a major crisis,\u201d said Carlos Buesa, founder and chief executive of Oryzon Genomics, a Spanish biopharmaceutical firm. \u201cWhat is happening now gives me a sense of sadness and incredulity. If this political conflict over the Catalan identity continues, the Catalan economy will be impoverished.\u201dInvestment has been returning to Spain, financing its fast-growing auto industry and a resumption of construction. The unemployment rate has dropped from a terrifying peak of 26 percent to a still-alarming 17 percent. But political turmoil, legal ambiguity and confusion over the basic geography of Spain could prompt a reversal.\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Angel Talavera, a senior eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London and a native of Spain. \u201cAs long as this situation is so confusing and no one really knows what\u2019s going to happen, money is going to start leaving Spain. Money moves fast.\u201dOn Friday, Madrid was paying 1.7 percent on its 10-year bonds. That was a modest number, far from a sign of the world on fire. Yet it was twice as high as a year earlier. The gap between what investors were demanding for taking on Spanish debt and that for taking on German debt \u2014 the least risky asset in Europe \u2014 has widened slightly in recent weeks.The increase to borrowing costs was fueled by a gnawing question: If Catalonia were to depart Spain, what happens to Spain\u2019s debt obligations?\u201cIn the sovereign bond market, the only guarantee is that someone should trust the state that issued the debt,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cSay Spain breaks up. Who is responsible for this debt? Are they going to split it between Catalonia and the rest of Spain?\u201dRoughly a fifth of Spain\u2019s total economic output comes from Catalonia. Whatever territories were to emerge from a divorce, they would be smaller and presumably less creditworthy than the government standing behind Spanish bonds now.The operative assumption in the marketplace is that Catalan independence will not happen. But markets trade in probabilities. The odds for independence have improved in recent days. Investors are demanding compensation for the elevated risks of holding Spanish debt.The unease appeared to be amplified by a case of chronic uncertainty fatigue plaguing Europe, especially as Britain pursues its exit from the European Union. Brexit, as that is known, has unleashed a bewildering array of unknowns on the European marketplace, and especially for global banks.In Spain, unpredictable forces were washing over the economy. The Catalan referendum was held on Sunday. As markets opened on Monday, investors punished banking stocks.\u201cInvestors saw the ears of the wolf,\u201d said Miguel Otero Iglesias, a senior analyst at Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid. \u201cIf people are willing to put children in front of riot police, they might as well be claiming independence. That\u2019s when rational business calculation starts to flounder.\u201dBy the end of trading on Wednesday, Banco Sabadell\u2019s shares were down by nearly 10 percent while CaixaBank had suffered an 8 percent plunge.Among the most heavily regulated products on the planet are pharmaceuticals. On Tuesday, Oryzon Genomics announced that it was moving to Madrid from Barcelona.\u201cWe are at risk of being caught in a situation of legal limbo following a possible unilateral declaration of independence,\u201d said Mr. Buesa, the company\u2019s chief executive. Oryzon\u2019s share price soon surged by nearly 13 percent.The rest of Catalonia and Spain do not appear likely to find such a quick fix.\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty right now,\u201d said Mr. Borri, the finance professor. \u201cMarkets are worried.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Money Shouldn\u2019t Buy Democrats\u2019 Silence", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFor years, Harvey Weinstein, a film and television producer at the apex of the American entertainment industry, has lavished money and attention on the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest names and causes.The report described Mr. Weinstein\u2019s efforts to meet women in hotel rooms, where he touched them, asked them to watch him shower or massage him while he was nude.The report revealed Mr. Weinstein to be a big-screen version of what working women encounter every day: a boss who thinks he can take what he wants from them, and cover his tracks with money when he\u2019s caught. There\u2019s little doubt his power encouraged his brazenness and helps explain how he got away with it for so long. Mr. Weinstein controlled many avenues to advancement in his industry and could kill the career of any woman who didn\u2019t hush up.The sums he paid his accusers were paltry compared with those that men like Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly paid their accusers, but the accusations were similar.Women who spoke on the record for Thursday\u2019s report, including the actress Ashley Judd, said they hoped to encourage women throughout the work force, not just celebrities in high-profile industries, to come forward and expose predatory behavior. \u201cWomen have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it\u2019s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly,\u201d Ms. Judd said. How familiar that sounds to all working women.Tales of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s offenses were widely shared in Hollywood but not publicly discussed. Despite years of fund-raisers with Hollywood celebrities, those who took his donations may have never heard the stories. But they have now.In a statement both remorseful and self-aggrandizing, Mr. Weinstein pledged yet more money for liberal causes, including gun control and scholarships for women in film. Money, though, is not going to solve this problem.Those allies, including Mr. Weinstein\u2019s prominent friends, need to publicly assert that the behavior that has made him notorious cannot be tolerated. Not from anyone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At a Tumultuous Moment, Unesco Picks a New Leader", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe change of leadership comes at a tumultuous time for the agency, whose goals of promoting education and defending human rights have been hampered in recent years by a lack of funding and disputes between member states, which sometimes use the organization as a forum to settle political or historical scores.\u201cIt\u2019s an institution that for a while now has lost the thread of its initial mission,\u201d said Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris.Mr. Lafont Rapnouil, a former French diplomat who has worked on United Nations affairs, said that the organization was started to foster cultural and educational exchange as a way of contributing to world peace. Instead, he said, too often it has been used as a platform for countries to take largely symbolic jabs at other countries.The former culture minister, Audrey Azoulay, was elected by Unesco\u2019s executive board, meeting at the organization\u2019s Paris headquarters, to a four-year term. She defeated Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari, a Qatari diplomat.Jean-Yves Le Drian, France\u2019s foreign minister, said in a statement congratulating Ms. Azoulay that Unesco was facing \u201chistoric challenges\u201d and that France would work toward \u201ca strong and responsible multilateralism.\u201dThe election on Friday ended a weeklong process that whittled down a field of nine candidates during several rounds of voting. Although the executive board\u2019s nominee must be formally approved by Unesco\u2019s 195 member states in November, that step is seen as a formality.Ms. Azoulay argued before the vote that she would strive to \u201crestore\u201d Unesco\u2019s credibility and efficiency by focusing on its core missions. In the wake of the United States\u2019 withdrawal, she said France had decided \u201cnot to leave it, but to get even more involved.\u201dBut she will lead at a difficult time for the agency.Regional rivalries were also on display during this week\u2019s voting. Qatar, Egypt and Lebanon each fielded a candidate instead of uniting behind a common bid, even though Arab countries had long agreed that it was their turn to lead Unesco, which Westerners have directed repeatedly since its founding in 1945.Qatar had lobbied extensively over the past two years for the Unesco position, and Mr. Kawari was seen as a favorite.Moushira Khattab, a diplomat who was Egypt\u2019s candidate, was eliminated from the race earlier on Friday after a preliminary vote to decide whether she or Ms. Azoulay would move into the final round. Both had received 18 votes in the fourth round of voting on Thursday.The balloting for director general is secret, making it difficult to know how each member state on the board voted, but Ms. Azoulay, a latecomer to the race, might have benefited in the final round from the rivalry between Qatar and Egypt.Unesco\u2019s difficulties were compounded on Thursday when the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw from the organization. The administration, which has repeatedly criticized United Nations agencies over the past months, cited anti-Israel bias and mounting arrears to explain the decision. Israel also said Thursday that it was taking steps to withdraw.\u201cDespite all of its many shortcomings,\u201d the newspaper wrote, Unesco has an important role to play \u201cin a world beset by political and religious extremism, by conspiracy theories, and often by a calling into question of science.\u201dMs. Azoulay, who was born into a Jewish Moroccan family, served for just over a year as culture minister under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Although she declared her candidacy before the election of the current president, Emmanuel Macron, the new government supported her bid.Mr. Lafont Rapnouil, the analyst, said that the first challenge for Ms. Azoulay would be to find common ground among Unesco\u2019s member states to define the body\u2019s key priorities in the coming years, a task he called \u201cdifficult.\u201d\u201cIn a context where the United States and Israel are readying to leave, there is going to be an even more political and polarized dimension to the way Unesco is going to work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Does Verizon Care About Telephone Poles?", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Like every other 8-year-old whom I tutored at a local school, Omar didn\u2019t know anything \u2014 and didn\u2019t care much \u2014 about high-stakes disputes over net neutrality, free speech and privacy that have consumed much of the news coverage of the telecommunications industry in recent years. Yet the inability of Omar\u2019s parents to afford broadband internet access lies at the heart of a battle that will have a far greater impact on his future: the fight over street poles.Public street poles may not look like much, but to wireless service providers, they\u2019re valuable real estate. Companies like Verizon want low-cost access to them to install equipment to handle the rapidly growing demand for mobile data. But poles are owned locally, and cities and counties aren\u2019t eager to give away access at below-market rates. Doing so would essentially subsidize an already wealthy industry \u2014 nationwide, as much as $2 billion a year, money that could otherwise go to expanding low-cost broadband access for people like Omar\u2019s family.As a result, the industry is waging a war for those poles, at all levels. Big Telecom and its allies in the White House have quietly carried out a campaign to secure rapid and cheap access to those poles, at taxpayer expense. Here in California, state legislators recently advanced a bill introduced by Senator Ben Hueso that would allow wireless service providers to install their equipment on public street poles at below-market rates \u2014 and to do so nearly wherever and whenever they choose \u2014 all in the name of \u201cstreamlining\u201d local permit approvals.What do our taxpayers get in return for this sweetheart deal? Wireless companies insist that these legislative proposals will reduce costs for consumers, and deliver better-quality cellular voice and data service. Yet, in truth, they do nothing to actually ensure that customers will benefit from a single dollar of the cost savings that the corporate telecoms will pocket.Moreover, service improvements will benefit only those customers able to afford its service. Despite the windfall that wireless providers receive at taxpayer expense, these industry-backed proposals do not require, or even encourage, the companies to expand broadband access to underserved rural and low-income neighborhoods.There\u2019s no provision in the California legislation, for example, for broader deployment for low-income neighborhoods. In San Jose alone, over 40 percent of low-income residents lack broadband access. While the industry will respond by pointing to its discounted internet service plans, they remain of such poor quality that students like Omar cannot download their teachers\u2019 video-recorded lesson plans, or a Khan Academy instruction on algebra, particularly when multiple family members are sharing the same account.In essence, these wireless service providers seek all of the privileges of a regulated water or electric utility \u2014 taxpayer-subsidized use of public infrastructure, deployment in locations of their choosing, overrides of the local government\u2019s authority \u2014 but without the accompanying responsibility: to serve everyone.It gets worse. The push by industry and the Trump administration to override local authority to set lease rates will undermine many cities\u2019 efforts to expand digital access. That\u2019s because San Jose; Tacoma, Wash.; and many other progressive cities seek to use lease revenues from street poles to finance the expansion of low-cost broadband to poorer neighborhoods. Otherwise, the wealthy will receive better service, and the poor will remain shut out.These proposed regulations also supplant local communities\u2019 authority with industry fiat to determine how to deploy telecommunications equipment over public streets, sidewalks and parks. Homeowners surprised by the sight of refrigerator-size equipment installed on poles outside of their windows will have no ability to seek redress from City Hall to change the location or to mitigate the aesthetic impact of these unsightly fixtures. And because signals from of these devices can disrupt the operations of others, they can preclude cities from installing public-serving devices \u2014 such as gunshot-spotters or traffic safety sensors \u2014 on their own street poles.These are just a few of the reasons a growing number of local elected leaders have opposed the industry\u2019s efforts in state legislatures and at the F.C.C. Here in California, the mayors of six of our largest cities \u2014 Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, Long Beach and Santa Ana \u2013 have joined leaders of 150 other cities in opposing California\u2019s version of this industry-backed effort.There is a better way. If the industry wants the same access to taxpayer-funded infrastructure that public utilities enjoy, it should bear the concomitant responsibility to make its services available to everyone in that jurisdiction. Alternatively, if Big Telecom doesn\u2019t want the responsibility of deploying broadband in low-income neighborhoods, then the states and the F.C.C. should continue to allow cities to charge market-rate fees and leases to generate municipal dollars needed to broaden access, as San Jose is doing in several low-income neighborhoods.We should all embrace the opportunity of greater broadband deployment, at better speeds, with the latest technology. Yet how we deploy this technology \u2014 and whether families like Omar\u2019s\u2019 will benefit \u2014 matters. If we\u2019re going to provide the telecom industry with unfettered access to public property, then the public\u2019s interest must come first.Sam Liccardo is the mayor of San Jose, Calif., and a member of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Broadband Development Advisory Committee.Advertisement"}

We are not here simply to mark time. Sustained incumbency is certainly not the point of seeking office and there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles. Now is such a time.It must also be said that I rise today with no small measure of regret. Regret because of the state of our disunion. Regret because of the disrepair and destructiveness of our politics. Regret because of the indecency of our discourse. Regret because of the coarseness of our leadership.Regret for the compromise of our moral authority, and by our, I mean all of our complicity in this alarming and dangerous state of affairs. It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end. In this century, a new phrase has entered the language to describe the accommodation of a new and undesirable order, that phrase being the new normal.But we must never adjust to the present coarseness of our national dialogue with the tone set up at the top. We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals. We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country. The personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms and institution, the flagrant disregard for truth and decency.The reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have been elected to serve. None of these appalling features of our current politics should ever be regarded as normal. We must never allow ourselves to lapse into thinking that that is just the way things are now.If we simply become inured to this condition, thinking that it is just politics as usual, then heaven help us. Without fear of the consequences and without consideration of the rules of what is politically safe or palatable, we must stop pretending that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal. They are not normal. Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as telling it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified.And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy. Such behavior does not project strength because our strength comes from our values. It instead projects a corruption of the spirit and weakness. It is often said that children are watching. Well, they are. And what are we going to do about that? When the next generation asks us, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you do something? Why didn\u2019t you speak up?\u2019 What are we going to say?Mr. President, I rise today to say: enough. We must dedicate ourselves to making sure that the anomalous never becomes the normal. With respect and humility, I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it.We know better than that. By now, we all know better than that. Here today I stand to say that we would be better served \u2014 we would better serve the country \u2014 by better fulfilling our obligations under the Constitution by adhering to our Article 1 \u2014 \u201cold normal,\u201d Mr. Madison\u2019s doctrine of separation of powers. This genius innovation which affirms Madison\u2019s status as a true visionary \u2014 and for which Madison argued in Federalist 51 \u2014 held that the equal branches of our government would balance and counteract with each other, if necessary.\u201cAmbition counteracts ambition,\u201d he wrote. But what happens if ambition fails to counteract ambition? What happens if stability fails to assert itself in the face of chaos and instability? If decency fails to call out indecency? Were the shoe on the other foot, we Republicans \u2014 would we Republicans meekly accept such behavior on display from dominant Democrats?Of course, we wouldn\u2019t, and we would be wrong if we did. When we remain silent and fail to act, when we know that silence and inaction is the wrong thing to do because of political considerations, because we might make enemies, because we might alienate the base, because we might provoke a primary challenge, because ad infinitum, ad nauseam, when we succumb to those considerations in spite of what should be greater considerations and imperatives in defense of our institutions and our liberty, we dishonor our principles and forsake our obligations. Those things are far more important than politics.Now, I\u2019m aware that more politically savvy people than I will caution against such talk. I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s a segment of my party that believes that anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a president who belongs to my party is unacceptable and suspect. If I have been critical, it is not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the president of the United States.If I have been critical, it is because I believe it is my obligation to do so. And as a matter and duty of conscience, the notion that one should stay silent \u2014 and as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters \u2014 the notion that we should say or do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavior is ahistoric and, I believe, profoundly misguided.A president, a Republican president named Roosevelt, had this to say about the president and a citizen\u2019s relationship to the office: \u201cThe president is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able and disinterested service to the nation as a whole.\u201dHe continued: \u201cTherefore, it is absolutely necessary that there should be \u2014 that there should be a full liberty to tell the truth about his acts and this means that it is exactly as necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile.\u201d President Roosevelt continued, \u201cTo announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by a president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.\u201dActing on conscience and principle in a manner \u2014 is the manner \u2014 in which we express our moral selves and as such, loyalty to conscience and principle should supersede loyalty to any man or party. We can all be forgiven for failing in that measure from time to time. I certainly put myself at the top of the list of those who fall short in this regard. I am holier than none.But too often we rush to salvage principle \u2014 not to salvage principle, but to forgive and excuse our failures so that we might accommodate them and go right on failing until the accommodation itself becomes our principle. In that way and over time, we can justify almost any behavior and sacrifice any principle. I am afraid that this is where we now find ourselves.When a leader correctly identifies real hurt and insecurity in our country, and instead of addressing it, goes to look for someone to blame, there is perhaps nothing more devastating to a pluralistic society. Leadership knows that most often a good place to start in assigning blame is to look somewhat closer to home. Leadership knows where the buck stops.Humility helps, character counts. Leadership does not knowingly encourage or feed ugly or debased appetites in us. Leadership lives by the American creed, \u201cE pluribus unum.\u201d From many one. American leadership looks to the world and just as Lincoln did, sees the family of man. Humanity is not a zero sum game. When we have been at our most prosperous, we have been at our most principled, and when we do well, the rest of the world does well.These articles of civic faith have been critical to the American identity for as long as we have been alive. They are our birthright and our obligation. We must guard them jealously and pass them on for as long as the calendar has days. To betray them or to be unserious in their defense is a betrayal of the fundamental obligations of American leadership and to behave as if they don\u2019t matter is simply not who we are.Now the efficacy of American leadership around the globe has come into question. When the United States emerged from World War II, we contributed about half of the world\u2019s economic activity. It would have been easy to secure our dominance keeping those countries who had been defeated or greatly weakened during the war in their place. We didn\u2019t do that. It would have been easy to focus inward.We resisted those impulses. Instead, we financed reconstruction of shattered countries and created international organizations and institutions that have helped provide security and foster prosperity around the world for more than 70 years.Now it seems that we, the architects of this visionary rules-based world order that has brought so much freedom and prosperity, are the ones most eager to abandon it. The implications of this abandonment are profound and the beneficiaries of this rather radical departure in the American approach to the world are the ideological enemies of our values. Despotism loves a vacuum and our allies are now looking elsewhere for leadership. Why are they doing this? None of this is normal.And what do we, as United States senators, have to say about it? The principles that underlie our politics, the values of our founding, are too vital to our identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the requirements of politics because politics can make us silent when we should speak and silence can equal complicity. I have children and grandchildren to answer to.And so, Mr. President, I will not be complicit or silent. I\u2019ve decided that I would be better able to represent the people of Arizona and to better serve my country and my conscience by freeing myself of the political consideration that consumed far too much bandwidth and would cause me to compromise far too many principles.To that end, I\u2019m announcing today that my service in the Senate will conclude at the end of my term in early January 2019. It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative, who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party, the party that has so long defined itself by its belief in those things.It is also clear to me for the moment that we have given in or given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment. To be clear, the anger and resentment that the people feel at the royal mess that we\u2019ve created are justified. But anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.There is an undeniable potency to a populist appeal by mischaracterizing or misunderstanding our problems and giving in to the impulse to scapegoat and belittle \u2014 the impulse to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking people. In the case of the Republican Party, those things also threaten to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking minority party.We were not made great as a country by indulging in or even exalting our worst impulses, turning against ourselves, glorifying in the things that divide us, and calling fake things true and true things fake. And we did not become the beacon of freedom in the darkest corners of the world by flouting our institutions and failing to understand just how hard-won and vulnerable they are.This spell will eventually break. That is my belief. We will return to ourselves once more, and I say the sooner the better. Because we have a healthy government, we must also have healthy and functioning parties. We must respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared facts and shared values, comity and good faith. We must argue our positions fervently and never be afraid to compromise. We must assume the best of our fellow man, and always look for the good.Until that day comes, we must be unafraid to stand up and speak out as if our country depends on it, because it does. I plan to spend the remaining 14 months of my Senate term doing just that.Mr. President, the graveyard is full of indispensable men and women. None of us here is indispensable nor were even the great figures of history who toiled at these very desks, in this very chamber, to shape the country that we have inherited. What is indispensable are the values that they consecrated in Philadelphia and in this place, values which have endured and will endure for so long as men and women wish to remain free.What is indispensable is what we do here in defense of those values. A political career does not mean much if we are complicit in undermining these values. I thank my colleagues for indulging me here today.I will close by borrowing the words of President Lincoln, who knew more about healthy enmity and preserving our founding values than any other American who has ever lived. His words from his first inaugural were a prayer in his time and are now no less in ours.\u201cWe are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break the bonds of our affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely as they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\u201dThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy\u2019s 3% Spurt Emboldens Tax Cut Supporters (and Critics)", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States economy is showing increased signs of resilience.Republicans called the report a sign that businesses were already spending more in anticipation of a corporate tax cut, and evidence that the economy could grow faster over the long term than currently forecast.\u201cIf you look at the G.D.P. data, it\u2019s clear that is a major reason,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, asserted on Friday.Many economists, however, are reluctant to give Congress or the administration too much credit for the economy\u2019s trajectory.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been anything concrete in terms of spending or tax cuts that we can point to that\u2019s fueling the acceleration,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. If anyone deserves credit for the good news, he said, it is the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.But economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent. The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent.With legislation embodying the party\u2019s tax proposals expected next week, the figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their policy: They are celebrating faster growth while arguing that tax reform is needed to accelerate it further.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that \u201cour economy produced solid growth last quarter\u201d and went on to say that tax reform was a way to \u201ccontinue this growth\u201d and \u201creinvigorate America\u2019s economy.\u201dThe complication is that faster growth could undermine the party\u2019s case that tax cuts are needed to add fuel to an economy that is already running with low unemployment \u2014 and it could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly, which could dampen the effects of any tax bill.Liberal economists said the report showed the success of Ms. Yellen at the Fed and undermined the case for the Republican tax bill. \u201cThe underlying trend in G.D.P. growth is clearly telling us two things,\u201d Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email. \u201cKeep on rockin\u2019 steady with Yellen at the Fed, and there\u2019s no need for a big, wasteful tax cut.\u201dThe Fed, judging that the economy is growing about as fast as it can, is on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December to a level Fed officials have described as likely neither to encourage nor to discourage growth. The Fed\u2019s plans do not reflect the potential economic impact of a tax cut.After the shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output. After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year.\u201cIf you don\u2019t go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house,\u201d said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. \u201cIf you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy.\u201dThe destruction wrought by the storms was outweighed by the continued spending of consumers and businesses. The job market is lively, and the stock market has rallied to record highs. Chief executives and consumers are more confident than they have been in more than a decade, recent surveys show.\u201cThere are no real headwinds to growth for the first time since the expansion began,\u201d said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe are at full employment and we are in full swing; let the good times roll.\u201dSpending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements. One reason companies may be investing more in their business is that the labor market has tightened and wages are rising.\u201cBusinesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies,\u201d said Mr. Anderson of Bank of the West.Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust 3.9 percent. Mr. Zandi said the numbers were \u201ca sign that consumers are hanging tough.\u201dAt the same time, with a weak dollar making American goods more competitive abroad, international trade contributed positively to output for the third quarter in a row. Imports decreased.The weak dollar through much of this year has been a boon to exporters like David Ickert, vice president for finance at Air Tractor Inc. The company, which is based in Olney, Tex., a town of about 3,100 people west of Dallas, makes crop dusters and forestry firefighting planes for markets including European countries along the Mediterranean Sea, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Half of its sales are international.\u201cThings are picking up \u2014 I sense it in Europe,\u201d Mr. Ickert said. He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filtered down to rural communities. \u201cTrade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business,\u201d he said.The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent. And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year.\u201cThis is happening globally,\u201d Mr. Zandi, the Moody\u2019s economist, said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single major economy that is in recession.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Push Into a Resurging Market: House Flipping", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersBut that real estate strategy \u2014 in which a home is bought, renovated and resold quickly \u2014 requires fast access to money, and developers are willing to pay higher interest rates for it. The loans are backed by the property and are short, typically running for a year or less. And the funds that finance them offer reliable returns of about 8 percent, for those who can meet minimum investments, generally $100,000.But the loans \u2014 sometimes referred to as fix-and-flip or hard-money loans \u2014 come with risks, including developers unable to pay them back and a drop in real estate prices that could make properties hard to sell or even rent.Chris Gutek, a former equity analyst at Morgan Stanley who has been an independent investor in Grand Rapids, Mich., for the last decade, said he lost money on loan funds in 2008 but remained bullish on the sector.\u201cI was getting nice 12 to 13 percent interest for a few years, but I had one very bad experience in 2008,\u201d Mr. Gutek said. \u201cI lost a bunch of money. It was not good underwriting.\u201dFunds set up these days by lenders like Genesis Capital in Los Angeles and Anchor Loans in Calabasas, Calif., say they are more transparent and conservative in their underwriting. Mr. Gutek has put about 20 percent of his liquid assets in a fund managed by Broadmark Capital, an investment bank in Seattle that has $350 million in 200 short-term loans.\u201cSince 2009, the fund hasn\u2019t been tested, and I\u2019m very, very aware of that,\u201d Mr. Gutek said. \u201cThere is some risk that real estate values will reset, but I feel good about the meaningful investment process.\u201dFor skeptics, the quick turnaround on real estate speculation might evoke the go-go thinking that led to the mortgage crisis just a decade ago. But investors say hard-money loans are more stable than a bank mortgage because they are secured by properties at a lower loan-to-value ratio, a risk assessment used by lenders.The average loan-to-value ratio in the industry is about 55 percent, compared with 75 percent to 80 percent for a typical mortgage. This provides a substantial cushion to protect against a property\u2019s falling in value. It also ensures that developers do not walk away from the properties, because they have put a substantial amount of their own money into a project.\u201cWhen the loan matures \u2014 let\u2019s say it\u2019s 11 months \u2014 we want our borrower to be successful,\u201d said Stephen Pollack, the chief executive and president of Anchor Loans.If the developer runs into a problem, \u201cwe\u2019ll try to help them come up with a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll ask them to put a tenant in there and take out a rental loan. But if the risk of the loan has changed and it\u2019s at a higher leverage amount, we want to do something to get us in a safer position.\u201dIn other words, the developer needs to put more money in, which Mr. Pollack said most of them agree to because they want to continue their relationship with Anchor.And because the length of the loan is shorter than a mortgage, the risk is smaller.\u201cThere\u2019s an asset bubble in stocks and a bond rally,\u201d said Shannon L. Saccocia, managing director of Boston Private Wealth. \u201cIs this creating the opportunity for another bubble in real estate? The reality is for us, given the short duration of the loans, they\u2019re easy for us to monitor. They\u2019re very different from securitization.\u201dTo make their portfolios more stable, some lenders diversify across several states so they are not stuck in one market or move into different types of real estate, like retail and land.\u201cThe benefit for a high-net-worth investor coming in is, they\u2019re instantly diversified,\u201d said Joseph L. Schocken, president of Broadmark Capital. \u201cAnd to have that kind of diversified portfolio producing the yield we\u2019ve produced \u2014 roughly 11 percent \u2014 is very unusual. What will get your attention is the stability.\u201dHis firm runs two funds and is about to start a third. All three focus on booming cities like Atlanta, Denver and Seattle. He said his goal was to make the book of loans as transparent as possible.The average loan varies in size depending on the lender, ranging from several hundred thousand to $15 million. At Rubicon Mortgage Fund, loans average $800,000 to $1 million. Douglas C. Watson, a principal at the firm, said that although Rubicon was focused on the San Francisco Bay Area, it had diversified into retail, storage and land.Hard-money lenders boast of the speed in which they finance loans, typically in less than a week, compared with several months for a traditional bank. For the smaller builders and house flippers who rely on these loans to do business, the speed with which these lenders can have the money ready trumps the high interest rates they charge.Jeff Walker, a principal at Square One Homes in Renton, Wash., which builds multifamily homes in Seattle, said he had been using hard-money lenders for more than a decade. He has borrowed often from Broadmark and tries to laugh off the rates he gets \u2014 usually around 12 percent interest with 4 percentage points of fees for a one-year loan: \u201cThat\u2019s outrageous, but what are you going to do?\u201dIt\u2019s the company\u2019s timeliness that matters to him when he needs to move quickly in the hot Seattle real estate market.\u201cI can say, I\u2019ll close on it within 48 hours, and I can get them to help me do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can compete against a cash buyer, even though I\u2019m not a cash buyer.\u201dBut even Mr. Walker, who said he typically made 35 to 40 percent return on his projects, is cautious that too much of a good thing can be, well, too much.\u201cSeattle is a booming market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come to an end at some point, but why not make it while you can?\u201dInvestors seem undaunted by the risk of a collapse.Richard Mulcahy, president of the Washington division of Northwest Bank, said he had started investing his personal money in hard-money loans after seeing how well the builders did with the loans.\u201cThe vast majority of builders could graduate to the national bank stage, but many are willing to pay that cost of credit because they know they can get a loan,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulcahy said he had invested about 50 percent of his wealth in one of the Broadmark funds. \u201cVarious people who are professionals in the industry, including one of my sons, say it\u2019s too high,\u201d he said. \u201cIt speaks to my absolute feeling of security and the way they\u2019ve set up the fund,\u201d which has no debt and invests only in first mortgages.Goldman Sachs\u2019s acquisition of Genesis Capital might demonstrate the evolution of the industry.The firm had expanded rapidly after a 2014 investment of at least $250 million from Oaktree Capital Management that Genesis used to buy out its early, individual investors and grow nationally, said Rayman Mathoda, co-chief executive of Genesis.Ms. Mathoda said the company focused now on small to midsize real estate businesses, not individual borrowers.\u201cA lot of folks make the mistake of thinking of this as a \u2018once in a cycle\u2019 opportunity when real estate is booming,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s driven by the metropolitan areas. We\u2019re improving the super-aged housing stock in America.\u201dBut the business is still driven by wealthy investors able to meet minimum investments of $100,000 or more.\u201cIn these markets, the risks feel reasonable,\u201d Mr. Gutek said. \u201cIf Seattle\u2019s real estate is cratering, the stock market has already cratered.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the name of a money lender focused on the San Francisco Bay Area. It is Rubicon Mortgage Fund, not Rubicon Mortgage Lending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A 3-Way Debate Is Expected to Be a 2-on-1 Against de Blasio", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio and two of his general election opponents will face off in a televised debate Tuesday night that could produce a few sparks \u2014 but not if the mayor can help it.Both challengers, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican candidate, and Bo Dietl, a former police detective running as an independent, said they planned to ignore each other and seek to make the debate a two-way contest between themselves and the mayor.\u201cShe needs to try to make news in some way or get under the mayor\u2019s skin,\u201d Mollie Fullington, a Republican political consultant who is not working with any of the candidates, said of Ms. Malliotakis.Mr. de Blasio, she said, \u201cneeds to be the statesman. He needs to talk about the things he\u2019s accomplished for the City of New York and rise above it.\u201dThe three candidates were at the rain-soaked Columbus Day Parade on Monday. At one point, Mr. Dietl shouted to Mr. de Blasio from the sidewalk as the mayor passed by.\u201cThe mayor is going to discuss his record lifting up New Yorkers by highlighting his achievements, such as record-low crime, a greater push on affordable housing, fighting for working people,\u201d said Phil Walzak, a senior adviser to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign.He said that Mr. de Blasio would also drive home the message \u201cthat New York City needs and deserves someone who\u2019s going to stand up to Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous agenda, and the other people on stage can\u2019t be trusted to do that because they both voted for him.\u201dAsked about Mr. Dietl, Mr. Walzak said: \u201cNew Yorkers aren\u2019t interested in a circus. They want a serious conversation about the issues.\u201dMs. Malliotakis, who represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn in the Assembly, spent part of the weekend and Monday preparing for the debate, including holding mock debating sessions. Her campaign spokesman, Rob Ryan, played the role of Mr. Dietl, while in at least one session, the state Republican Party chairman Edward F. Cox played Mr. de Blasio.\u201cThis is my chance to introduce myself to New York City,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be judged for some party label, but my platform and the vision I have for this city.\u201dShe added, \u201cThis election is really between Mayor de Blasio and myself, and there\u2019s a stark contrast between what our priorities are and where we believe the city should be heading.\u201dShe accused Mr. Dietl of wanting to promote himself instead of discussing issues.Mr. Dietl said in an interview last week that in preparing for the debate he had practiced only with a stand-in for Mr. de Blasio, with no one standing in for Ms. Malliotakis. (Mr. Walzak refused to say how the mayor had prepared for the debate.)But on Monday, Mr. Dietl said that he did not need to prepare.\u201cWhen you tell the truth, you don\u2019t have to remember what you said,\u201d said Mr. Dietl, who cultivates a Yogi Berra-like relationship with the English language that may be more intentional than spontaneous. \u201cI don\u2019t have to prepare. When you know the facts you know the facts. I\u2019m so excited.\u201dHe said that his strategy was to train his fire on the mayor and ignore Ms. Malliotakis. If she targets him, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to say, \u2018I\u2019m not here against you, you\u2019re a nonentity. It\u2019s me vs. Big Bird de Blasio.\u2019\u201dMr. Dietl added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be better than Sonny Liston vs. Muhammad Ali, and I\u2019m Muhammad Ali.\u201dJ.

{"Headline": "British Columbia Shelves Opaque System for Corporate Tax Breaks", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBritish Columbia\u2019s government has rejected a last-ditch effort to save a longstanding program of tax breaks that was meant to create jobs and attract businesses to the western Canadian province but was widely criticized for failing to do so.The International Business Activity Program, created in 1988 and expanded several times, operated under an unusual cloak of secrecy compared with similar efforts in Canada and the United States.At that time, more than 80 companies participated in the program, according to the Ministry of Finance, which ran it.In September, the program was canceled by the recently elected provincial government, led by the New Democratic Party. On Thursday, an amendment to maintain the program\u2019s funding was defeated by the provincial legislature, after the ministry revealed previously undisclosed data showing the tax incentives did little to benefit the provincial economy.\u201cMinistry of Finance analysis, based on actual taxpayer data, clearly shows this tax subsidy wasn\u2019t delivering the promised jobs or economic activity,\u201d Carole James, the minister of finance, said in a statement.\u201cThe program was projected to cost $25 million in 2017-18 \u2014 money that is better invested in areas that matter to British Columbians, like education, health care and transit,\u201d she said.The tax breaks allowed companies to claim a refund of up to 100 percent of their provincial corporate income taxes on business activities that included lending, foreign exchange trading and investment management. Such breaks had the potential to reduce a company\u2019s tax rate to 15 percent.Although the government oversaw the program, participating companies were required to join and fund a nonprofit group, AdvantageBC, led by a former provincial finance minister, Colin Hansen. He declined to identify which companies were in the program.Critics said the opaque nature of the program made it virtually impossible for British Columbians to learn whether the tax incentives were worth the lost revenue. Although the tax breaks had been projected to generate thousands of jobs, ministry estimates showed that as few as 122 jobs had been created as a result of the program.While the tax breaks were designed to attract companies to British Columbia, Ms. James, the finance minister, told the legislature on Wednesday that the five companies receiving the largest tax refunds were already in the province before the program was expanded in 2004.The ministry released a 2010 review of the program that included previously redacted information. One of the program\u2019s objectives, the review noted, was to \u201ccreate new employment opportunities and well-paid, highly skilled jobs.\u201d But it said that companies benefiting from the tax breaks had generated \u201cminimal\u201d job growth, even though the program was dramatically expanded that year.Critics said the newly disclosed information underscored the need to abolish an opaque system.\u201cIt\u2019s a demonstration of what happens when you\u2019re not running an open and transparent government,\u201d said Dermod Travis, the executive director of IntegrityBC, a nonpartisan political watchdog group based in Victoria, the provincial capital. \u201cYou end up with bad programs that produce little or nothing in terms of benefits for British Columbians.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mnuchin Says Estate Tax Repeal Will Help \u2018Rich People\u2019 Most", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and Republican leaders have positioned a proposed repeal of the estate tax as a way to help farmers, ranchers and small business owners. But on Friday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, offered a significant concession about who would benefit the most if the so-called death tax disappears: the rich.Speaking at the Institute for International Finance conference, Mr. Mnuchin said the estate tax should be eliminated for both philosophical and economic reasons. He said that many taxpayers give the government half their income during their lives and that they should not have to give away a big chunk when they die \u2014 even if their families are wealthy.\u201cObviously, the estate tax, I will concede, disproportionately helps rich people,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of the administration\u2019s proposal to repeal the measure.\u201cTo protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Preliminary analyses of the tax framework produced by the \u201cBig Six\u201d Republican tax working group last month were faulted for overwhelmingly benefiting the rich while potentially increasing taxes on some upper-middle-class families. The overall cost of the plan is expected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit and, according to the Tax Policy Center, repealing the estate tax would reduce federal revenues by $239 billion over a decade.Mr. Mnuchin expressed confidence on Friday that tax legislation would at least \u201cbreak even\u201d and that it would likely reduce the deficit because of the robust economic growth he thinks it will create. However, he said that because of congressional rules about calculating the effects of the tax bill on the economy, some of the changes to the tax code will likely have to expire.\u201cParts will be permanent and parts will be temporary,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Republicans could face pressure to keep the estate tax in place if their tax rewrite, which has yet to be detailed in its entirety, is seen as skewed toward the rich and not doing enough to help the middle class. The push to entirely repeal the tax has also been complicated by previous efforts that pared it back.A tax-cut package passed by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 gradually phased out the tax for nearly all Americans. Before its passage, only the first $650,000 in an estate was exempt from taxation. That exemption grew over the course of a decade and, after a year of all estates being shielded from the tax, it settled in 2011 near its current level.That growing exclusion weakened the long-running contention, which Mr. Trump and others have continued to press this year, that the tax hurt family farms, small businesses and Americans whom many people would not consider wealthy.Mr. Mnuchin, who previously said that tax bill would be signed into law by August, said on Friday that it would be on the president\u2019s desk by early December.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York to Replace MetroCard With Modern Way to Pay Transit Fares", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow that familiar symbol of daily life is something else \u2014 outmoded. And it is on the way out.On Monday, the city\u2019s transit system took a significant step toward a more modern way for passengers to pay their fares. Starting late next year, they can do it the way Londoners already do, by waving cellphones or certain kinds of credit or debit cards at the turnstiles in the subway or the fareboxes on buses.\u201cIt\u2019s the next step in bringing us into the 21st century, which we need to do,\u201d said Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the transit authority. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be transformative.\u201dIt will certainly change riders\u2019 habits. No longer will they have to endure frustrating waits in long lines at card-dispensing machines in subway stations, though there will still be machines for people who do not have cellphones or credit or debit cards.Nor will passengers have to refill their fare cards week after week or month after month. The new system will keep track in an account that riders can check online.The challenges involved with making the trains run have to do with the outdated infrastructure in the tunnels and along the tracks, not the somewhat less-antiquated infrastructure of the MetroCard system.Officials see the new payment system as a way to make getting into subway stations and onto buses faster, though that could bring more passengers into a system that is already straining to handle the millions it carries every day.The new system will replace the MetroCard, but MetroCards will not be phased out until 2023 \u2014 30 years after they replaced tokens for subways and buses. Until 2023, passengers can pay their fares the new way or with a MetroCard. The new system will also process fares for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, which are also operated by the transportation authority.The most obvious difference will be what passengers do to go through a subway turnstile or board a bus: wave or tap a smartphone or a credit or debit card, instead of swipe a MetroCard.The system will work through apps like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay as well as \u201ccontactless cards\u201d \u2014 credit or debit cards with embedded chips that rely on a wireless technology known as near field communication, or N.F.C.\u201cThe millennial generation, those who are more prone to new technology, will be our greatest users in the early stages,\u201d Mr. Lhota said. He added that card issuers \u201care going to want to be a part of it\u201d and would add the near-field technology \u201cwhen they realize that 5.8 to 6 million people in New York City are getting on the subway every day.\u201dMr. Lhota said another potential advantage was that fare readers could be installed near the back doors on buses to \u201callow for all-door boarding.\u201d That would let buses pull away from bus stops sooner than they do now, reducing travel times.The transit agency is hiring the same company that designed the system in London, which is also the company that developed MetroCards a generation ago. In London, the card that riders use is called the Oyster. In New York, the name has yet to be determined.The new system will not mean the end of the flat fare that has defined the New York subway system since it opened in 1904. Fares on the London Underground are based on distance, as they are in other cities that use similar technology, like Washington. But Mr. Lhota said he was not contemplating changing the fare structure for the subways. (The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North do charge by distance, using zones that usually include several stations.)The reaction from transit advocates to the MetroCard\u2019s eventual demise was generally positive.\u201cFirst things first: moving to a modern fare system is a convenience for riders,\u201d said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance. \u201cIt allows them to benefit from the extraordinary innovations the private sector is undertaking these days.\u201d But he said the new system would also benefit the transit agency, which has run its own currency system since the subways were brand new more than a century ago.\u201cThe digital payment world has moved so quickly in the last 20 years that the M.T.A. has been left completely behind,\u201d Mr. Raskin said. \u201cSwitching to a system that can take advantage of that means the M.T.A. shouldn\u2019t end up in a situation where in 10 years it\u2019s out of date. It can take advantage of every new innovation that\u2019s yet to come.\u201dThomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group, praised the move, predicting that ridership would increase once the new fare system was widely available, just as it did after the MetroCard was introduced.He called the new fare system \u201ca real win-win and an important step for the M.T.A. to be taking.\u201dThe transit agency has been talking for years about replacing the MetroCard, which made its debut when Bill Clinton was president. The basic fare then was $1.25 \u2014 $1.50 less than it is now and $1.75 less than with a single-ride MetroCard.The transit agency ran a pilot program for a successor to the MetroCard in 2006. Officials hoped to do away with MetroCards by 2012 and believed that contactless bank cards would be the way to the future. But while such cards were popular in Europe, they did not immediately catch on in this country.Cubic signed a licensing deal in 2016 with Transport for London, the transit agency for greater London, that allowed Cubic to take the technology developed for London to other cities.But calls about New York\u2019s new fare payment system, once it is installed, will be answered nearly 400 miles away, in Buffalo. Cubic plans to open a call center there, putting jobs in an area that is struggling economically but is important politically to state officials like Mr. Cuomo, who controls the transit agency.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress, End the Health Care Chaos. You Have 9 Million Kids to Protect.", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPresident Trump and Republicans in Congress have brought chaos to the American health care system by trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act and failing to reauthorize the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which, with bipartisan support for the past 20 years, has provided care for millions of children. Over the next few weeks they can choose to set things right or to destroy them.First up, the Alexander-Murray deal represents real progress. These two no-nonsense lawmakers \u2014 the leading Republican and Democrat on the Senate health committee \u2014 have done yeoman\u2019s work trying to fix a mess created largely by Mr. Trump. Their bill would appropriate money for payments to insurance companies that the president said he was stopping last week. He said they amounted to an illegal corporate bailout \u2014 a blatant lie. These payments, authorized by the A.C.A., or Obamacare, compensate insurers for lowering the deductibles and co-payments for low-income families. Further, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray would require the administration to spend $106 million on advertising and on people to help people sign up for insurance when open enrollment begins on Nov. 1. Mr. Trump\u2019s minions at the Department of Health and Human Services slashed spending on outreach efforts in recent months.The deal also advances two Republican health care ideas: giving states more flexibility to make changes to the A.C.A. and letting more people sign up for high-deductible health care policies. Thankfully, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray have made sure that neither of these changes undermines Obamacare\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions and the requirement that insurers cover essential health services like maternity care and cancer treatment. These changes could make the law function better by allowing sparsely populated states to attract more insurers by, for example, making it easier for them to set up reinsurance programs that protect companies from losses from a few customers. And the proposed high-deductible plans could work well for a small subset of people who buy A.C.A. policies but do not receive subsidies because they earn too much money.So far, neither Mr. Trump nor Republican leaders in Congress have taken these vital matters very seriously. Mr. Trump has made several contradictory statements about the Alexander-Murray proposal and he has not said much of anything about children\u2019s health insurance.That only makes it more crucial for members of Congress to heed Mr. Alexander, who said on Tuesday, \u201cI don\u2019t know a Democrat or a Republican who benefits from chaos.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sleepy New Jersey Governor\u2019s Race Turns Fiery in First Debate", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 The low-profile governor\u2019s race in New Jersey shed its sleepy veneer on Tuesday night as the first general election debate quickly descended into an hourlong rumpus that was both acerbic and wonkish with the two candidates repeatedly lacing into each other\u2019s positions and personal background.Though the moderators tried to keep the two candidates from confronting each other, the personal invective at times overshadowed any attempts at addressing specific questions from the moderator or the audience.Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, the Republican candidate, repeatedly sought to bring up Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street bank where Philip D. Murphy, her Democratic opponent, worked for several years. The references drew boos at one time from the audience who seemed to view them as off topic.For his part, Mr. Murphy, over and over, tried to paint Ms. Guadagno as being attached to Gov. Chris Christie \u201cevery step of the way.\u201dBut the repeated reference to Mr. Christie, one of the most unpopular leaders in recent state history, gave Ms. Guadagno her strongest line of the night, drawing cheers from supporters and a raised eyebrow from Mr. Murphy.\u201cThe inconvenient truth for Phil is that Chris Christie is not on the ballot in November,\u201d she said. \u201cI am.\u201dMs. Guadagno, under mounting pressure to chip into Mr. Murphy\u2019s double-digit lead in recent polls and seizing the chance to make her case before a television audience, kept returning to an issue that she has made central to her campaign: property taxes.\u201cThe first thing we can do to help the middle class is to have a thriving middle class,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the way we help the middle class is lowering property taxes.\u201dShe brought up property taxes while discussing a variety of issues, including school funding, immigration, job growth and the importance of keeping college graduates from leaving the state.And she used the issue to attack Mr. Murphy on two fronts: his promise to provide the state\u2019s full share of school funding, estimated by Mr. Murphy to be about $9 billion, and his tepid response to whether he would continue to seek an arbitration cap that limits raises for public workers, such as police officers and firefighters.\u201cI want to directly answer the question that you put to Phil Murphy, one I have yet to hear him answer,\u201d she said. \u201cI would extend the arbitration cap because it saves the taxpayers of New Jersey billions of dollars.\u201dMr. Murphy sidestepped the initial question on the topic, saying that he was waiting for \u201call the facts.\u201dWhen Mr. Murphy pledged to fully fund the state\u2019s pension obligation, a moderator pressed him on how he would do that.\u201cWe have a very credible plan,\u201d Mr. Murphy responded.The moderator was unimpressed. \u201cI still haven\u2019t heard how.\u201dWhile vague on numbers in certain areas, Mr. Murphy offered plenty of data in others, including the grim condition of the state\u2019s economy and the precise number of days that Mr. Christie and Ms. Guadagno had been in office \u2014 2,821, according to Mr. Murphy.Mr. Murphy not only took advantage of Ms. Guadagno\u2019s ties to her boss, but also sought to link her to the one elected official who is disliked by a large majority of the state: President TrumpHe repeatedly made reference to the \u201cGuadagno-Christie\u201d administration and called Ms. Guadagno, \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump.\u201dMr. Murphy promoted himself as a check on Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, declaring that New Jersey would protect undocumented immigrants.\u201cIf need be, we will be not just a sanctuary city, but a sanctuary state,\u201d he said.Ms. Guadagno countered by channeling lines that were familiar on the presidential campaign trail: describing crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.Mr. Murphy quickly retorted.\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is what Donald Trump does,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cYou pit us against them. You cast a pall over entire communities of people. It is un-American.\u201dRecent events also triggered acrimonious exchanges.Mr. Murphy denied, when asked by a moderator, ever accepting money from Mr. Weinstein, a deep-pocketed Democratic donor.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for and I didn\u2019t get one dime from this guy,\u201d said Mr. Murphy, calling him \u201cheinous\u201d and adding that \u201canyone who did should give it back.\u201dMs. Guadagno wasn\u2019t satisfied by his answer. \u201cI want to call Phil Murphy a coward,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cPhil Murphy didn\u2019t start to talk about Harvey Weinstein until after my campaign today listed the tens of thousands of dollars that he raised\u201d as a part of his position as a finance chair for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cShame on him for not coming forward earlier,\u201d she added.\u201cI literally have no idea what she\u2019s talking about,\u201d Mr. Murphy snapped when she finished.Amid the insults, there were moments of levity. When boos from the crowd began to interrupt Ms. Guadagno, she stopped midsentence, saying she would wait them out.Mr. Murphy joked, \u201cThose were your folks.\u201dMs. Guadagno laughed. \u201cWell said.\u201dAnd when a microphone malfunctioned as a college student was asking a question, Ms. Guadagno invited him onstage, telling him to speak into her microphone that was clipped on her white jacket.When he paused, she joked, \u201cMy husband is in the front row.\u201dAs for Mr. Christie, whose name was cited and derided often, he was not at the debate supporting his lieutenant governor. He probably was not even watching it live on TV.Instead, he told reporters earlier on Tuesday, that he was going to TiVo it.Advertisement"}

Under the [collective bargaining agreement], the mere fact that a player is unsigned does not constitute evidence of collusion.Why this matters\u2022 Mr. Kapernick\u2019s protest during the national anthem set off President Trump\u2019s attacks against the league, pitting players against owners and drawing sponsors into the fray.\u2022 If N.F.L. owners had hoped for a swift end to the controversy, they\u2019re probably disappointed.The answer:And Steve Bannon went on record to say that the White House move was meant to destroy the Obama health care plan.Bannon said Trump\u2019s decision to not continue funding Obamacare subsidies, announced Thursday, was designed to \u201cblow up\u201d the health care law and insurance marketplaces.\u201cGonna blow those exchanges up, right?\u201d Bannon said.Terminating this critical program will do just the opposite. This action will make it harder for patients to access the care they need. Costs will go up and choices will be restricted.The insurers may have backing from Republican politicians who protested the move.But the biggest opposition may come from some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own base.The bottom lineWill a coalition of insurers, politicians and voters overturn what Mr. Trump has started?\u2022 The Senate is scheduled to vote tomorrow on starting debate on the 2018 fiscal year budget.What happens when perhaps the most hotly anticipated initial public offering doesn\u2019t take place?Reports now say that Aramco probably would list on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul exchange next year.

It was formed from dozens of elasticated bandage-style strips of knitted cloth, creating a body-sculpting, skintight silhouette.At the peak of his popularity, Mr. L\u00e9ger\u2019s designs were worn by stars and celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, Victoria Beckham and Melania Trump.On her blog, Ms. Kardashian wrote of the bandage dress in 2016: \u201cI would literally save up all my paychecks and go and wait, and stalk the girls that worked at Herv\u00e9 and just get all the new colors.\u201dMr. Leroux was born Herv\u00e9 Peugnet on May 30, 1957, in Bapaume, in northern France. He studied sculpture and art history at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris before dropping out to become a hairstylist and milliner.Mr. Leroux, now working under the name L\u00e9ger, worked alongside Mr. Lagerfeld at Fendi and later at Chanel and freelanced at Lanvin and Diane von Furstenberg before introducing his own boutique, Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger, in 1984. A fashion line with the new name soon followed, and then came the inception of the bandage dress.\u201cThe story of the dress is a very simple one,\u201d Mr. Leroux said. \u201cBefore I started making clothes, I was a hairdresser, then a hat maker. One day in a factory I found some bands that were headed for the garbage. They gave me the idea of taking those bands and putting them next to one another as one does making a hat.\u201dCoinciding with the ascendance of Azzedine Ala\u00efa, the so-called King of Cling, Mr. Leroux\u2019s bandage dress received considerable acclaim. It was designed to encase a figure and enhance it in the most flattering of ways. While sales never reached blockbuster levels, the dress\u2019s aesthetic impact would be seen in the work of rivals on runways and on the clothes racks of mass-market retailers.\u201cMr. L\u00e9ger proved why Paris is the center of fashion creativity,\u201d Carrie Donovan wrote in The New York Times Magazine after a show in 1991, using the surname he went by at the time. \u201cHis collection was original, well thought out, knowledgeably executed and about as incendiary as style can be these days.\u201dHis designs also proved alluring to investors keen to expand the company across product lines and geographical borders. In 1998, Mr. Leroux\u2019s business was acquired by the Los Angeles-based group BCBG Max Azria. It was the first time an American company had acquired a French designer-couturier.But he quickly fell out with the new owners, and in 1999 he lost control of the L\u00e9ger name, which was retained by Mr. Azria, who called the new collection \u201cHerv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger by Max Azria.\u201dIn 2000, Mr. L\u00e9ger founded his own independently financed fashion house, Herve L. Leroux, adopting a new surname that had again been suggested by his old friend and mentor Mr. Lagerfeld.As Mr. Leroux recalled in an interview with Style.com in 2006, \u201cHe told me, \u2018Call yourself Leroux because your hair is red \u2014 not as red as it was, because you are older \u2014 but, anyway, it works, and everyone will know who you are.\u2019\u201dIn the last chapter of his career, Mr. Leroux\u2019s clientele remained loyal to his feminine jersey dresses and his chic approach to contemporary cocktail attire. As creative director of the Paris house Guy LaRoche from 2004 to 2006, he dressed Hilary Swank for the 2005 Academy Awards ceremony in a memorable backless midnight-blue jersey gown, which was seen by millions of television viewers when she strode to the stage to accept the best actress award for her performance in the movie \u201cMillion Dollar Baby.\u201dMr. Leroux showed a new collection in 2013 as a guest on the Paris couture calendar after a 12-year hiatus from the catwalk. But he never again achieved the recognition or fame he found under his previous name, underscoring the creative and commercial struggles that can ensue when a designer\u2019s name is no longer the designer\u2019s.He is survived by his sister, Jocelyne, who was a partner in the Leroux business.After the news of his death broke, many of those who loved his designs shared tributes on Instagram.An obituary on Tuesday about the fashion designer Herv\u00e9 L. Leroux misidentified the movie for which Hilary Swank won an Academy Award in 2005, the year she wore a dress he designed to the ceremony. It was \u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d not \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d (for which she won the award in 2000).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liam Cosgrave, Irish Premier Who Helped End Violence, Dies at 97", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiam Cosgrave, a dour and dogged former prime minister of Ireland whose ingrained devotion to political stability in the 1970s helped break his country\u2019s cycle of violence, died on Wednesday in Dublin. He was 97.His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Leo Varadkar, the incumbent taoiseach (a Gaelic word commonly pronounced TEA-shock), or prime minister, of the Republic of Ireland. He said that Mr. Cosgrave had \u201calways believed in peaceful cooperation as the only way of achieving a genuine union between the people on this island.\u201dMr. Cosgrave\u2019s law-and-order agenda and renunciation of terror were steeped in his own family\u2019s protracted revolt against British domination since the Irish Rebellion of 1798.His father, W. T. Cosgrave, participated in the 1916 Easter Rising and was sentenced to death for his role in it, though the sentence was later commuted to a life term, which in turn was nullified when he was released in 1917.The elder Mr. Cosgrave was the first elected president of the executive council of the Irish Free State, serving from 1922 to 1932. The post was considered equivalent to the taoiseach.Liam Cosgrave was a member of the Dail Eireann, or Assembly of Ireland, from 1943, when he was 23, until 1981 and led the Fine Gael party from 1965 to 1977. He was elected prime minister in 1973, but an economic slump helped doom his chances for re-election four years later.During his one term in office, he negotiated what became known as the Sunningdale Agreement, which diluted the Irish Republic\u2019s constitutional claim to Northern Ireland. The agreement signed by the mostly Roman Catholic republic acknowledged that the predominantly Protestant north was a province under British control.Both sides agreed that the status of the six counties that constituted Northern Ireland could change, but only by a majority vote of their residents.While the agreement collapsed within months, it formed the basis for the 1998 Good Friday power-sharing arrangement that eventually ended years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, commonly known as the Troubles. Seamus Mallon, a Northern Irish minister, described the Good Friday Agreement as \u201cSunningdale for slow learners.\u201dOn a trip to Washington in 1976, Mr. Cosgrave, addressing a joint meeting of Congress on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, characterized Americans who financed terrorists in British-ruled Northern Ireland as \u201cpeople who support violence at a distance and who can sleep easy on the wounds of others.\u201dLater that year he pressed for the imposition of legal restraints on the Irish Republican Army, which fought to make all of Ireland an independent republic, saying: \u201cThe crimes perpetuated by men of violence have brought discredit to the name of Irishmen throughout the world and death and damage to our own people. Our past has been devalued and our future threatened by their outrages.\u201dLiam Cosgrove was born on April 13, 1920, in Castleknock, a Dublin suburb, just months before the establishment of the Irish Free State that year \u2014 \u201cYear One in Irish history,\u201d as the dramatist Sean O\u2019Casey wrote.His mother was the former Louisa Flanagan. His father, William, was a grocer and pub keeper who was elected to the first Irish Assembly in 1919 after his release from prison. He became head of the provisional government in August 1922 after the deaths of Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, both of whom helped negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and dealt ruthlessly with the new administration\u2019s opponents.Liam Cosgrave interrupted his law studies at the Honorable Society of King\u2019s Inns, a school in Dublin, to protect Irish neutrality during World War II. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Defense Forces and admitted to the bar in 1943, the year he began serving in the Assembly with his father.His wife, the former Vera Osborne, died in 2016. He is survived by their children, Mary, Liam T. and Ciaran, and two grandchildren.In 1970, Mr. Cosgrave was instrumental in pressuring Prime Minister Jack Lynch to fire two ministers accused of importing arms for the Irish Republican Army.A staunch Catholic, Mr. Cosgrave stunned his party colleagues in 1974 by opposing his own government\u2019s bill that would have allowed married couples to obtain contraceptives. The bill was defeated.An ardent horse breeder and fox hunter, he presided over a relatively progressive government.Mr. Cosgrave may not have been a worldly visionary, but he was a diligent if taciturn retail politician who was first elected from County Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, south of Dublin on the Irish Sea.In 1956, according to political lore, Mr. O\u2019Brien had drafted a speech on the Mideast conflict for Mr. Cosgrave to deliver to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The speech would be well received, but Mr. Cosgrave had suggested one change to Frederick Boland, Ireland\u2019s permanent representative to the United Nations.Mr. Cosgrave, who was minister for external affairs at the time, wanted to add the line \u201cI appeal to the Jews and the Muslims to settle their differences in accordance with Christian principles.\u201dWhen Mr. Boland replied, \u201cConor seems to think it won\u2019t go down all that well in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Cosgrave was unfazed.\u201cIt may not go down well in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Boland told Mr. O\u2019Brien, \u201cbut the minister seems to think it will go down well in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown.\u201dAn obituary on Oct. 10 about Liam Cosgrave, a former prime minister of Ireland, gave an incorrect guide for the pronunciation of \u201ctaoiseach,\u201d the Gaelic word for prime minister.

{"Headline": "\u2018Transformation Is Happening\u2019: Saudi Aramco\u2019s Chief on Future of Oil", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, prepares for a widely-awaited initial public offering next year, its chief executive, Amin H. Nasser, is at the center of the planning.He spoke to Stanley Reed, a New York Times reporter, on the sidelines of an event sponsored by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a partnership of 10 international oil companies that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the industry.Their conversation, edited for grammar, style and clarity, follows.Q. How will the privatization, or initial public offering, help Saudi Aramco?You will see, first of all, a lot invested in technology to add more value. While everyone else cut technology spending, we are increasing our technology spending. We have eight technology hubs outside Saudi Arabia, and three inside Saudi Arabia, for a total of 11. Two of our technology hubs focus on better fuel formulation, less carbon footprint, more efficiency in car engines.That all will hopefully, at a certain point, be shared with investors when we are listed.Do you have any doubt that the listing will happen?No, the listing is happening. You have confirmation from the Crown Prince this week, and our minister of energy and the minister of finance, all the stakeholders in the kingdom. It is happening in 2018.Is Aramco working on renewables, like wind and solar power?It is an important element of our strategy, to get into renewables. The kingdom, as I said, is looking at producing 9.5 to 10 gigawatts by 2023. So yes, we are interested and we are going to be a major player in renewables.Are your customers unhappy about your holding back production to honor your agreements with OPEC and Russia?We have a long-term relationship with our customers. They appreciate our reliability, the quality of our products. We value all of these relationships. We are always there when the market goes down and there are not enough resources, because we do have the spare capacity and we always meet our obligations.There is a requirement placed on the company, based on the cuts by OPEC members and non-OPEC members, and we are abiding by that guideline. Our customers and partners understand that issue and because of the long-term relationship, it is not impacting our business transactions with them. They value the partnership that we have together.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Are you losing market share?Everything is temporary. We are in a market that is very dynamic, and so far things are going well. We are meeting our obligations in certain markets. And there has been no issue so far.Are you happy with how the production cuts are working?We are seeing inventories go down, which is great. Don\u2019t forget, it was just an additional supply of 2 million barrels that brought the price from $100 to $40. Now, you don\u2019t want the opposite to happen. You need to make sure there is ample supply.You need to make sure inventories are balanced in a way where it meets the objectives of both the consumers and producers. So inventories are going down, prices are moving upward as a result of that balance between supply and demand.Is there concern in Saudi Arabia that as renewables rise in importance, oil could become a stranded asset and lose its value?We don\u2019t subscribe to that thought about stranded assets. We think that oil will have more value in the future, and that rational development of our oil assets should be done reasonably over a long time.If you look today, the requirement is 98 million barrels per day. Over the last three years, demand has grown by 5 million barrels per day. Add to that, a natural decline of 5 percent in existing fields. So you need to bring additional crude reserves to the market to meet the natural decline, and to meet the additional demand that we are going to see.So I think oil will remain for decades to come. Transformation is happening, but it is going to take a long time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Pulls Back From Senate Deal to Fund Health Subsidies", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe latest actions by the White House confused Republicans on Capitol Hill and irked Democrats \u2014 but in the end, their effect was not clear. The effort to calm roiled insurance markets appears destined for a showdown in December, when supporters of the compromise, drafted by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, will have the most leverage.On Wednesday, the White House sent a different message.I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said later that Mr. Trump did not support the deal in its current form but indicated that changes could win him over.\u201cWe want something that doesn\u2019t just bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all Americans,\u201d she said, adding that the deal was \u201ca good step in the right direction.\u201dRepublicans in Congress have hardly rushed to embrace the deal, but it has won endorsements from a handful of Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\u201cCongress has a responsibility to ensure that families in Tennessee and across our country who receive health insurance through the individual market do not continue to be burdened with rising premiums and fewer choices,\u201d Mr. Corker said.And an unavoidable fiscal deadline this year still offers an opportunity for lawmakers to demand that the subsidies be funded, regardless of the president\u2019s position. Lawmakers need to pass a funding measure to keep the government open beyond Dec. 8, and no bill can pass without Democratic votes.At that point, supporters of the Alexander-Murray measure could insist on its inclusion in any spending bill and threaten to shut down the government if they do not prevail. If Republican leaders relent, Mr. Trump\u2019s veto of the health measure would effectively shutter the government.Still, the uncertainty around the legislation grew on Wednesday. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, reflecting his most conservative members, came out against the deal.\u201cThe speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,\u201d said Doug Andres, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan.And the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, expressed frustration over a president who \u201ckeeps zigging and zagging, so it\u2019s impossible to govern.\u201d\u201cYou never know from hour to hour what he thinks,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Senate Republican, had predicted on Tuesday that Congress would \u201cmove fairly quickly\u201d on the bipartisan proposal, but he revised that forecast on Wednesday. For now, he said, the plan has \u201cstalled out.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a holding pattern,\u201d he said, as Mr. Alexander tries to convince the president that the deal would benefit consumers, not insurance companies.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, said he disagreed with Mr. Alexander\u2019s plan. \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to do a good thing, but it\u2019s only temporary, and it leads us down a primrose path that we don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, said he received a telephone call on Wednesday from the president. \u201cHe wanted to be encouraging about the bipartisan agreement that Senator Murray and I announced yesterday,\u201d Mr. Alexander said at a forum convened by Axios, a news website.Mr. Trump \u201cintends to review it carefully to see if he wants to add anything to it,\u201d Mr. Alexander said of the Senate plan.In fact, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray had already moved to address concerns that restoring the payments to insurers could be viewed as providing them with a \u201cbailout.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Alexander said that their deal would contain \u201cthe strongest possible language\u201d to ensure that the money provided for the subsidies would go to benefit consumers, not insurers.The bill drafted by Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray would provide \u201csuch sums as may be necessary\u201d through 2019 for cost-sharing payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act. State insurance regulators would have to certify that insurers use the money to provide \u201ca direct financial benefit to consumers.\u201dMr. Alexander said later Wednesday that he was open to \u201cimprovements or changes that the president wants to make\u201d in the deal and that he completely agreed with Mr. Trump that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to bail out insurance companies.\u201dThe draft bill would also make it easier for states to obtain waivers from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. But the bill includes protections for consumers: Any state plan would have to provide coverage \u201cof comparable affordability, including for low-income individuals, individuals with serious health needs and other vulnerable populations.\u201dNot content to wait for Congress, the attorneys general of California, New York and 16 other states asked a federal district judge on Wednesday for a temporary restraining order that would force the Trump administration to continue making the subsidy payments. A court order is urgently needed, they said, because the next installment of federal subsidies is due on Friday.The states, which filed suit against the federal government last Friday, said that the payments are required by the Affordable Care Act and that ending them would destabilize insurance markets and cause increases in premiums and in the number of uninsured.On Wednesday, Mr. Alexander predicted that the plan would \u201cpass in some form before the end of the year,\u201d and he said that Mr. Trump had \u201cengineered the bipartisan agreement by calling me and asking me to work with Senator Murray to do it.\u201d Mr. Alexander said the deal included several victories for conservatives, making it easier for states to revamp their insurance markets and allowing people of any age to buy low-cost, high-deductible health plans providing catastrophic coverage.A federal judge ruled in 2016 that the federal payments to insurance companies, known as cost-sharing reductions, violated the Constitution because Congress never provided money for them. The White House, describing the payments as unlawful, announced last week that they would be cut off.Mr. Trump says he still supports longer-range efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with block grants to the states.Such big changes would not take effect until 2020 or 2021, Mr. Alexander said, offering a warning against creating \u201cchaos\u201d in the meantime.\u201cWhat does chaos do?\u201d Mr. Alexander asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a four-lane highway to a single-payer solution. It\u2019s a birthday present for Bernie Sanders,\u201d the independent Vermont senator and leading advocate for a single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Dossier: What We Know and Who Paid for It", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe dossier of research into President Trump\u2019s connections to Russia is the product of a research firm founded by a former journalist, Glenn R. Simpson.It is a 35-page collection of research memos written by Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence agent, primarily during the 2016 presidential campaign. The memos, compiled by a research firm called Fusion GPS, allege a multifaceted conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to help Mr. Trump defeat Mrs. Clinton. The memos also detail unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, and real estate deals that were intended as bribes, among other claims about Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses.After Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates \u2014 including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information.In October, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post that his party was outraged at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s involvement.That depends on your politics.Democrats argue that who paid for the research is irrelevant to the veracity of its claims, which they say should be thoroughly investigated. Yet some of the Democrats who funded the dossier have been wary of being associated with it. The lead Perkins Coie lawyer representing both the campaign and the D.N.C., Marc Elias, pushed back earlier this year when asked whether his firm was the client for the dossier, whether he possessed it before the election and whether he was involved in efforts to encourage media outlets to write about its contents.In October, the veteran Democratic consultant Anita Dunn, who is working with Perkins Coie, explained Mr. Elias\u2019s earlier response. \u201cObviously, he was not at liberty to confirm Perkins Coie as the client at that point, and should perhaps have \u2018no commented\u2019 more artfully,\u201d Ms. Dunn wrote in an email.Campaigns and party committees frequently pay companies to assemble what\u2019s known in politics as opposition research \u2014 essentially damaging information about their opponents \u2014 and nothing is illegal about the practice.However, Republicans and campaign watchdogs have accused the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. of violating campaign finance laws by disguising the payments to Fusion GPS on mandatory disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. Their disclosure reports do not list any payments from the Clinton campaign or the D.N.C. to Fusion GPS. They do list a total of $12.4 million in payments to Perkins Coie, but that\u2019s almost entirely for legal consulting, with only one payment \u2014 of $66,500 \u2014 for \u201cresearch consulting\u201d from the D.N.C.Graham M. Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, called the complaint \u201cpatently baseless,\u201d in part because, he said, the research was done \u201cto support the provision of legal services, and payments made by vendors to sub-vendors are not required to be disclosed in circumstances like this.\u201dOfficials from the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. have said they were unaware that Perkins Coie facilitated the research on their behalf, even though the law firm was using their money to pay for it. Even Mrs. Clinton found about Mr. Steele\u2019s research only after BuzzFeed published the dossier, according to two associates who discussed the matter with her. They said that she was disappointed that the research \u2014 as well as the fact that the F.B.I. was looking into connections between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russia \u2014 was not made public before Election Day.But word of the memos and their contents had circulated in Washington political and media circles before the election. In British court filings, Mr. Steele\u2019s lawyers said that he and Fusion GPS briefed journalists from a range of media outlets, including The New York Times, on his research starting in September 2016.Mr. Simpson has provided at least 20 hours of testimony to three different congressional committees investigating the possible Russia ties.

{"Headline": "Reeling From Scandal, Weinstein Company Gets a Financial Lifeline", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The embattled Weinstein Company on Monday secured a financial lifeline \u2014 and possible new owner \u2014 from an investor with experience in distressed Hollywood assets. But the fate of the studio, including whether its co-founder Bob Weinstein would stay involved, remained far from resolved.Tarak Ben Ammar, one of three remaining Weinstein Company board members, said in a statement on Monday that the studio, reeling from sexual harassment allegations made against the company\u2019s other co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, had reached a preliminary agreement with Colony Capital for an \u201cimmediate\u201d cash infusion. The amount was undisclosed.Mr. Ammar also said that Colony, which rescued Michael Jackson\u2019s Neverland Ranch from foreclosure in 2008, had entered negotiations to buy all or most of the Weinstein Company\u2019s movie and television holdings. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., founder of Colony Capital, said in a statement that he believed the sullied studio \u201chas substantial value and growth potential.\u201d A deal is expected to take three weeks or more to complete.Not mentioned by the Weinstein Company on Monday: Bob Weinstein, who insisted on Friday that speculation about a sale was \u201cuntrue.\u201d Harvey Weinstein was fired by the company last week.Bob Weinstein is fighting to remain at the studio, but some stakeholders believe he must leave, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Bob Weinstein, who told The Hollywood Reporter on Saturday that he did not know \u201cthe extent\u201d of his brother\u2019s actions, did not respond to a request for comment.In turning to Colony, the Weinstein Company and its advisers at the investment bank Moelis & Company are reaching out to a firm with experience in Hollywood. But some longtime media investors, noting the seriousness of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, questioned what could be done with such a toxic asset.Four board members have resigned in recent days, leaving only Mr. Ammar, Bob Weinstein and Lance Maerov.As a private company \u2014 the brothers each own about 23 percent \u2014 the Weinstein Company has never been particularly forthcoming about its revenue or debt load. In recent years, as talk of unpaid bills and an inability to finance marketing campaigns has occasionally surfaced, the Weinsteins insisted their company was, in fact, rolling in money.But certain financial problems surfaced that Harvey Weinstein was unable to refute. Facing bankruptcy in 2010, for instance, the Weinstein Company sold rights to 200 older films to Goldman Sachs and an insurance company, Assured Guaranty. The exact titles that were sold are not publicly known. Goldman, in turn, sold its portion to AMC Networks in 2015.The Weinstein Company now has assets that fall into three groups: the remaining library of old movies, upcoming films and television. All three are problematic.Given the 2010 sale, much of the value of the library has \u201calready been extracted,\u201d Mr. Malin said.The Weinstein Company has seven completed movies, but some of those are art films with limited box office potential, especially without Harvey Weinstein\u2019s hard-knuckled efforts to strengthen audience interest through awards campaigns. Others are potentially tainted by the scandal that has settled over the studio.One movie on the Weinstein Company\u2019s release schedule is \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d for instance. The first \u201cPaddington\u201d took in a solid $76.3 million in North America in 2015. But marketing a family movie is going to be hard for a company associated with harassment allegations.Anchored by \u201cProject Runway,\u201d the Weinstein Company\u2019s television unit has been a bright spot recently. Upcoming series include three projects for the Paramount Network, the Viacom-owned channel formerly known as Spike. (A Paramount spokesman confirmed on Monday that those were moving forward.) But other television projects have died over the last week as networks have scrambled to sever ties with the studio.\u201cThe question is whether the television division is a going concern or a liquidation,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cSome will argue that the major asset of the television division was Harvey Weinstein\u2019s ability to be a rainmaker \u2014 to line up deals.\u201dColony Capital is the private equity arm of Colony NorthStar, an investment firm that controls $56 billion in assets. Mr. Barrack, its chairman, has gained attention recently for his longtime friendship with President Trump. Mr. Barrack was a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and served as chairman of his inaugural committee.Mr. Barrack, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants who owned a grocery store in the suburbs of Los Angeles, made his money by betting on out-of-favor assets. In the 1990s, Colony Capital bought bad loans during the savings-and-loan crisis and bet on Asian assets after the Asian currency crisis. The same strategy was used following the 2008 financial crisis. Colony Capital acquired billions of dollars of distressed commercial and residential property mortgages and loans that had been seized from failed banks by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.But Colony has also made a number of investments in distressed entertainment assets.In the spring of 2008, Colony bailed out Michael Jackson, who was on the verge of default over a $24.5 million mortgage for Neverland Ranch, his 2,500-acre playground in Santa Ynez, Calif. When Jackson died in 2009, the ranch wound up in Colony\u2019s hands. Renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch, the property was relisted this year for $67 million. That\u2019s down from the $100 million original listing price two years ago.In 2010, Colony acquired the debt of the celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz after she was unable to make payments on a $24 million loan.

{"Headline": "Suspecting Russian Meddling in \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote, Lawmaker Seeks Inquiry", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpeaking in Parliament, the lawmaker, Ben Bradshaw of the Labour Party, said there was \u201cwidespread concern over foreign, and particularly Russian, interference in Western democracies.\u201d He asked for assurances that \u201call the resources spent in the referendum campaign were from permissible sources.\u201dMr. Bradshaw\u2019s intervention follows the publication of what he called \u201cvery worrying\u201d reports \u201con the role of dark money\u201d in the plebiscite, which was held in June 2016 and in which 52 percent of those who voted opted to leave.Those who opposed Britain\u2019s withdrawal, or Brexit, argued during the referendum that it would delight Moscow by weakening the European Union, which placed sanctions on Russia. But no links to Russian money have been proved.Mr. Banks is a friend and political ally of Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and one of President Trump\u2019s biggest supporters in Britain. A businessman who made his money from insurance, Mr. Banks is thought to have spent about $12 million in cash, loans and other support for Brexit causes. He was the primary supporter of Leave.EU, for which Mr. Farage campaigned.The reports by Open Democracy, a liberal advocacy group, suggested that Mr. Banks, who had faced recent business setbacks, was considerably less wealthy than the $330 million he claimed, raising questions about how he was able to provide such large-scale financing for the Brexit cause.The reports\u2019 authors acknowledged, however, that Mr. Banks\u2019s \u201cpresent financial status\u201d is \u201csomewhat unclear\u201d because of his complex network of ownership stakes in different companies.Because of the reporting rules then in effect, the party did not have to divulge the sources of its funds. The campaign finance law has since been changed to add more transparency.Responding to Mr. Bradshaw in Parliament, Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative leader of the House of Commons, described the issue as \u201cincredibly important,\u201d adding that \u201cany specific information should always be raised with the Electoral Commission,\u201d referring to the body that oversees Britain\u2019s election rules.Speaking later, Mr. Bradshaw said that he was \u201cextremely concerned that there was Russian interference in our referendum in the same way that there was in the U.S. presidential election.\u201d He added that he was worried that the issue was not being treated seriously enough by the British government.Mr. Bradshaw, a former journalist and ex-minister in the Labour government of Tony Blair, previously raised concerns about financing in last year\u2019s referendum, during which he argued for Britain to remain in the European Union.Ms. Phillipson replied: \u201cThe commission is aware of media reports that allege that there could have been Russian involvement in the E.U. referendum. These cover a wide range of alleged activities that are beyond the commission\u2019s remit.\u201d\u201cAny allegation with evidence that a registered campaigner accepted impermissible donations from Russia would be investigated in line with the commission\u2019s enforcement policy,\u201d she added.Rumors of Russian involvement in the Brexit campaign have been swirling for months, and Mr. Banks himself encouraged some speculation in his book on the referendum campaign, \u201cThe Bad Boys of Brexit.\u201dAt one point, he describes attending a lunch at the London residence of the Russian ambassador, Alexander V. Yakovenko, in November 2015, in which he said he was invited to sample a rare vodka from a batch made for Stalin.Mr. Banks has denied, however, that any Russian money was used in the Brexit referendum campaign.He added, \u201cAs Churchill said, I\u2019m obviously upsetting the right sort of people.\u201dDan Bilefsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Pledges $60 Million for Antiterrorism Force in Africa", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe pledge, announced by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson in Washington and Ambassador Nikki R. Haley at the United Nations, came as the United Nations Security Council was meeting about the vast and lawless Sahel region in western and north-central Africa, where the force will operate.\u201cThis is a fight we must win, and these funds will play a key role in achieving that mission,\u201d he said.The 5,000-member force of soldiers and police officers, with recruits from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, was created by those countries in February to combat the growing threat of extremist groups, drug smugglers and human traffickers in the Sahel.With little government control, the region is regarded as a fertile haven for Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and their offshoots.The United States, the biggest single financial contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations, has been seeking to cut their costs and had resisted proposals to commit peacekeeping resources to the five-nation Sahel force.But the $60 million pledge suggested the American position may be evolving. It was announced less than four weeks after four American soldiers, including Special Forces members, were killed during a joint patrol with counterparts from Niger near the Mali border.Ms. Haley said in her remarks about the Sahel force at the Security Council that \u201cwe understand the force will need ongoing support and are eager for opportunities to work with our partners to make this effort a successful one.\u201dThe American pledge was welcomed by France, which has taken the lead in Western backing for the Sahel force.

{"Headline": "End of Apartheid in South Africa? Not in Economic Terms", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "Political liberation has yet to translate into material gains for blacks. As one woman said, \u201cI\u2019ve gone from a shack to a shack.\u201dSupported byCROSSROADS, South Africa \u2014 The end of apartheid was supposed to be a beginning.Judith Sikade envisioned escaping the townships, where the government had forced black people to live. She aimed to find work in Cape Town, trading her shack for a home with modern conveniences.More than two decades later, Ms. Sikade, 69, lives on the garbage-strewn dirt of Crossroads township, where thousands of black families have used splintered boards and metal sheets to construct airless hovels for lack of anywhere else to live.\u201cI\u2019ve gone from a shack to a shack,\u201d Ms. Sikade says. \u201cI\u2019m fighting for everything I have. You still are living in apartheid.\u201dIn the history of civil rights, South Africa lays claim to a momentous achievement \u2014 the demolition of apartheid and the construction of a democracy. But for black South Africans, who account for three-fourths of this nation of roughly 55 million people, political liberation has yet to translate into broad material gains.Apartheid has essentially persisted in economic form.This reality is palpable as turmoil now seizes South Africa. Enraged protesters demand the ouster of President Jacob Zuma over disclosures of corruption so high-level that it is often described as state capture, with private interests having effectively purchased the power to divert state resources in their direction. The economy keels in recession, worsening an official unemployment rate reaching nearly 28 percent.Underlying the anger are deep-seated disparities in wealth. In the aftermath of apartheid, the government left land and other assets largely in the hands of a predominantly white elite. The government\u2019s resistance to large-scale land transfers reflected its reluctance to rattle international investors.Today, millions of black South Africans are chronically short of capital needed to start businesses. Less than half of the working age population is officially employed.The governing party, the African National Congress, built empires of new housing for black South Africans, but concentrated it in the townships, reinforcing the geographic strictures of apartheid. Large swaths of the black population remain hunkered down in squalor, on land they do not legally own. Those with jobs often endure commutes of an hour or more on private minibuses that extract outsize slices of their paychecks.\u201cWe never dismantled apartheid,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a former economist for Oxfam, the international anti-poverty organization, and now the host of a radio show that explores national affairs. \u201cThe patterns of enrichment and impoverishment are still the same.\u201dSouth Africa began the post-apartheid era facing challenges as formidable as those confronted by Europe at the end of World War II, or the Soviet Union after communism. It had to re-engineer an economy dominated by mining and expand into modern pursuits like tourism and agriculture, while overcoming a legacy of colonial exploitation, racial oppression and global isolation \u2014 the results of decades of international sanctions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very deep structural problem,\u201d said Ian Goldin, who served as a senior economic adviser to Nelson Mandela when he was president of South Africa, and is now a professor of globalization at the University of Oxford in Britain. \u201cThe Russians had capitalism before the Soviet Union. Africans lost their rights 300 years ago. It\u2019s a much longer period of subjugation.\u201dEven so, from 1998 to 2008, the economy expanded by roughly 3.5 percent a year, doubling the size of the black middle class. The government built millions of homes, extended the reach of clean water and electricity, and handed out cash grants to millions of poor people.But the global financial crisis of 2008 ravaged South Africa, destroying demand for the mineral deposits at the center of its economy. It wiped out half of the roughly two million new jobs that had been created in the previous four years.Today, South Africa is a land of astonishing contrasts.In the Sea Point neighborhood of Cape Town, a sweep of apartments and restaurants alongside the Atlantic Ocean, women gather on the beach for an evening yoga class \u2014 some black, some white, some Asian. Children of multiple races scamper through a playground, a scene unthinkable during apartheid.High above the city, atop the ridgeline at Table Mountain, American exchange students recount a sky diving experience while pointing smartphones at the orange sun arcing toward the ocean.To the east, the parched land vibrates in the golden light. Judith Sikade\u2019s tin roof is down there somewhere, reflecting the last rays of the sun.In her community, people are cooking over coal fires and breathing in fumes. Children run barefoot on paths littered with broken glass. Grown-ups exchange word of the latest armed robbery.All the while, they keep an eye out for the police, who frequently descend bearing sledgehammers to tear down the shacks, given that they sit on private land.\u201cWhere\u2019s the freedom?\u201d Ms. Sikade said, anger rising in her voice. \u201cWhere are the changes?\u201dGrowing up in a township near Durban, on South Africa\u2019s east coast, Siyabonga Mzulwini placed his faith in the transformative powers of education.During apartheid, black education had been a consignment to permanent poverty. The Bantu educational system had been set up to churn out vast numbers of low-skilled, low-wage black workers to feed into mining operations.But Mr. Mzulwini, 28, was intent on gaining marketable skills. Four years ago, he graduated from a technical university with a diploma in business management.His flurry of job applications produced no response. So he and three partners registered their own company, hoping to get a crack at government contracts reserved for black-owned companies.They contemplated building a car wash. But when they applied for loans, the banks turned them away. They had no collateral.\u201cProperty rights are not at all clearly defined in black communities,\u201d said Dieter von Fintel, an economist at Stellenbosch University. \u201cCollateral is very difficult to secure.\u201dThis was both the product of colonialism, and the negotiated price of ending apartheid absent civil war. To gain the National Party\u2019s assent to elections, the A.N.C. forswore major transfers of land from white to black control.\u201cThe A.N.C.\u2019s primary objective was inclusion into the existing system,\u201d said Moeletsi Mbeki, deputy chairman of the South African Institute of International Affairs and a brother of the former South African president Thabo Mbeki. \u201cThey wanted themselves to be part of the capitalist economy.\u201dOnce in power, A.N.C. officials were loath to pursue policies that might be considered radical by international investors, lest it damage South Africa\u2019s credit rating.The new government confronted huge budget deficits along with extraordinary demands for housing and electricity. Building required loans from global investors. Land transfers risked spooking markets, jeopardizing the government\u2019s plans.\u201cWe all would have liked to do it differently,\u201d says Alec Erwin, who served as deputy finance minister in the Mandela government. \u201cWhether we could have done it differently is another question.\u201d\u201cWe inherited an economy that was beleaguered,\u201d he added. \u201cThose first years, we were grappling with avoiding a major collapse.\u201dThe government satisfied international markets and set the townships buzzing with construction. Yet this approach came at a cost, one Mr. Mzulwini and his partners were effectively bearing.As they started their business, they were operating with the same assets their families had owned during apartheid \u2014 nothing.They purchased a pair of lawn mowers, aiming to bid on government contracts to cut the grass alongside local highways. Time and again, they came away disappointed.One day, Mr. Mzulwini bumped into a college classmate who was working at city hall.\u201cHe told me that unless we paid a 10,000 rand bribe (about $737), we would never get any business,\u201d Mr. Mzulwini recalled. \u201cHe said if I gave him the money to give his boss, his boss would open doors for us.\u201dThat sum was wildly beyond reach. So Mr. Mzulwini and his partners eyed another target \u2014 contracts to help build government-furnished houses within the township. They approached a construction company to seek a role as a subcontractor.Rebuffed again, Mr. Mzulwini and his partners linked up with a federation of businesses operating under the name Delangokubonya Sa \u2014 Zulu for \u201cWe\u2019ll Believe It When We See It.\u201d The group is a platform for would-be black entrepreneurs frustrated by the A.N.C. machine.Federation brethren descended on the township construction site and threatened to shake the scaffolding if workers did not cease. The disruption gained Mr. Mzulwini a spot in a government program training people for careers as bricklayers.The following year, Mr. Mzulwini and his partners secured three contracts to do brick work, netting profits of 70,000 rand, about $5,150.\u201cBeing radical and forceful is what has given me hope,\u201d Mr. Mzulwini said.He is less optimistic for his country. \u201cThe system,\u201d he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t work.\u201dThe system does work, as it happens, though often for the benefit of the people running it.People like Marcus Moloeli.\u201cI always knew as a child there was something greater,\u201d he said. \u201cI was always curious, \u2018What is in there that I can\u2019t have access to?\u2019\u201dAt 38, Mr. Moloeli no longer needs to wonder.He lives in a gated community set atop jungle-covered hills north of Durban, on the Indian Ocean. His two-story house boasts glistening bathrooms, a pair of garages holding two Mercedes and an Audi, plus a golf cart he drives to the country club at the center of the complex.\u201cIt\u2019s a good environment for me to reflect,\u201d he said.On a recent afternoon, he leaned into a sofa, gazed at his private pool and reflected on how a black man born in apartheid South Africa had landed here.In his township school, 10 children shared a single textbook. For high school, he talked his way into a technical school reserved for Indians. After graduation, he bagged groceries, then moved into Johannesburg and took a job delivering antique furniture. He volunteered for a government-run youth league. That eventually turned into a staff position for President Zuma, overseeing youth affairs.Two years ago, he started his own consulting business. He secures contracts from local governments, advising them on how to manage their infrastructure. Soon, he was rich.The ranks of South Africa\u2019s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires expanded to 17,300 from 6,200 from 2007 to 2015, according to New World Wealth, a consultant based in Johannesburg. What many of these people have in common are lucrative ties to government.\u201cFor your business to survive and thrive, you must know a politician,\u201d Mr. Moloeli says. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have the networks and the access to resources, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am.\u201dMr. Moloeli\u2019s three children attend a predominantly white private school, where they take violin and golf lessons. He speaks of retiring at 45 so he can spend more time with them.\u201cGovernment has in a way provided a space for most people to succeed,\u201d Mr. Moloeli said. \u201cIf you are hungry enough, you can make it in South Africa. You can build a very beautiful lifestyle.\u201dSoweto, a township outside Johannesburg, holds special resonance as a cradle of the anti-apartheid movement. It was the home of Nelson Mandela, and the site of a 1976 uprising that set off a crackdown so brutal that images were broadcast around the world.In those days, Vilakazi Street, where Mr. Mandela lived, was a rutted dirt track lacking electricity. Today, it is a lively testament to South Africa\u2019s black middle class, which more than doubled from 2004 to 2013, reaching 4.2 million, according to estimates from the Unilever Institute for Strategic Marketing at the University of Cape Town.On a Saturday night, the street throbs with nightclubs blasting South African house music. Black professionals in chic clothes fill tables on terraces, lifting cocktails.Colin Amos stands at the curb greeting customers arriving at his restaurant and bar, Next Door. A black doctor with his own practice in Soweto, he opened the place last year as a sideline project, partnering with two friends. Together, they put in 1.5 million rand, more than $100,000.Here might be an example of post-apartheid black entrepreneurialism. Yet Mr. Amos views his experience as something else \u2014 an illustration of how the economy remains tilted against black people.The electricity frequently conks out, which forced him to purchase a costly generator. The restaurant next door gets most of the international visitors, owing to a relationship with the tourism authorities.The gated community where he lives north of Johannesburg is full of white families who inherited their property, he said, plus a handful of black families struggling to stay current on their mortgages.\u201cWe\u2019re sitting on a serious time bomb,\u201d said Mr. Amos\u2019s business partner, Bongi Vilakazi. \u201cEveryone I talk to is of the mind that we need to take what is rightfully ours.\u201dNext door to the Next Door, Mandla Majabula is irrepressibly intent on expanding the internet cafe he opened last year.Raised in a rural area dominated by coal mining, he moved to Johannesburg in 2004, just after graduating from high school, seeking a career that was less dangerous and more lucrative. He got hooked on the ambition infusing the city.\u201cI like seeing people who are better than me,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, I\u2019m nothing. I like to see people who have more.\u201dHe borrowed a friend\u2019s computer science textbook and taught himself to write code. Soon, he was designing websites for Soweto businesses.He rented a bare room on the ground floor of a crumbling house. He bought seven computers and opened his business.Mr. Majabula is undeterred. He is folding his profit into buying faster computers. He envisions waking up one morning in the suburbs.Four years ago, Andile Lili, a then-37-year-old member of the Cape Town City Council, began hearing from unhappy constituents in a ragged settlement carved into a garbage dump near the airport, improbably named Barcelona.The local authorities had constructed public toilets that emptied into giant white buckets, handing responsibility for collection to a private company. The company had supposedly cheated the workers, who were on strike. Along the dirt paths of Barcelona, human waste was forming into puddles. The stench was unbearable.People in Barcelona were angry about many things, from a lack of jobs to the absence of public transportation, but the sewage was the final affront. Their circumstances stemmed from an economic decision made in the first years of the post-apartheid era.Faced with the imperative to turn black political empowerment into material gains, some within the A.N.C. called for the townships to be dismantled while resettling people near cities. The townships were ghettos of isolation, full of leaky roofs and dangerous wiring. Better to build new housing connected to transportation, putting people near jobs.But Mr. Mandela, as president, argued that South Africa could not wait for new development. He opted to upgrade existing homes while expanding the townships by purchasing land.From 1994 to 2004, the government built close to two million new houses in townships and informal settlements.\u201cWe basically compounded the problems of apartheid by buying up all this cheap land as far out of the city as possible,\u201d said Alan Hirsch, a senior official in the Trade and Industry Department during the Mandela government, and now director of the Graduate School of Development Policy and Practice at the University of Cape Town.More than two decades later, people in Barcelona are absorbing the consequences.In wealthy, traditionally white parts of Cape Town, public restrooms came stocked with toilet paper and soap. They were looked after by janitors and security guards. People in Barcelona demanded the same.Mr. Lili, the City Council member, persuaded residents to unleash a more combative form of protest. They ferried their buckets into Cape Town, emptying their contents at the entrance to City Hall.Mr. Lili\u2019s movement produced immediate consequences. First, the city fixed persistent sanitation problems in his own community. Then, they gave him a government-furnished house. One day in November 2014, as he was planning a march, two men arrived at his home and shot him twice \u2014 once in the arm and once in the gut.Today in Barcelona, the contractor comes to retrieve the buckets every three days, but the crude system remains a central facet of everyday life.As Mr. Lili visited the settlement on a recent morning, 40 residents crowded around to complain that little had changed. Among them was Nombulelo Sakwe, a 38-year-old mother of four.As a child, Ms. Sakwe had used moonlight and candles to do her homework for lack of electricity. She had never managed to secure a full-time job, but was working two days a week as a domestic helper for a white family in Cape Town, earning 220 rand a day \u2014 about $16. Getting there and back by private bus absorbed more than half her pay.Her three oldest girls were in high school, and she hoped their lives would turn out differently. But she strained to see signs of that amid the filth, the crime and the merciless sun on her tin roof.\u201cOur children are being born in the same situation I was born,\u201d she says. \u201cWe still want to see this freedom.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio Finds Biggest Win in Pre-K, but Also Lasting Consequences", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring high-pressure meetings to plan the expansion of prekindergarten during his first months in City Hall, Mayor Bill de Blasio would invoke the D-Day invasion of Normandy: There it is on the horizon, he would say, we are approaching the beach, we need a full-on assault. He spoke of it so often that a staff member gave him a picture of the landing, which he kept on the mantelpiece in his office.\u201cIt was the proving ground of the capacity to actually do big things,\u201d the first deputy mayor, Anthony Shorris, said, citing other large-scale programs, like those for affordable housing, a city ID card and neighborhood policing.But the prekindergarten push also pointed to some of the weaknesses and blind spots that would become constants during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s four years in City Hall.But to his allies, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s ability to deliver on his promise has outweighed any complications.\u201cFor so long there\u2019s been this inequity of, if you could afford to send your children to pre-K they got a leg up,\u201d said the Queens borough president, Melinda Katz. \u201cBy the time they got into kindergarten, they were reading and writing, they could do basic math. That was such a crux of the inequity of the system.\u201dThe creation of universal prekindergarten, she said, \u201cdefines him, and it\u2019s going to have historical significance for our future generations.\u201dEven before his first day at City Hall, Mr. de Blasio and his aides were setting in motion the planned expansion of prekindergarten. One of the biggest challenges was finding enough space for hundreds of new prekindergarten classrooms.\u201cWe were totally wrong in our assumptions about space, and it was one of those real shocks to the system when we got in the door in the beginning of 2014 on a very, very tight time frame and had to stare down the barrel of that space reality,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference last month.To find, refurbish and secure approvals for classroom space meant coordinating multiple city agencies, including, in various combinations, the Education Department; the Fire Department; the departments of health, buildings, design and construction, housing preservation and development, and citywide administrative services; and the School Construction Authority.Laura Santucci, who was Mr. de Blasio\u2019s chief of staff during the first year, said that the multipronged effort inspired the mayor\u2019s frequent comparisons to D-Day, in which he likened the city\u2019s effort to an invasion by land, sea and air. When Ms. Santucci gave Mr. de Blasio the printout of a D-Day photograph, he gave her a high five, she recalled.But before he could begin to outfit classrooms, Mr. de Blasio needed money to pay for the initiative. His proposal, repeated often on the campaign trail, was to use a new dedicated tax on New Yorkers earning more than $500,000 \u2014 a maneuver that required Albany\u2019s approval.But Mr. Cuomo was running for re-election in 2014, and showed no enthusiasm for creating a new tax. Shortly after the mayor\u2019s inauguration, the governor embraced his call for prekindergarten, but not the new tax; Mr. Cuomo promised to include money for it in the state budget.Mr. de Blasio slapped the offer down.\u201cThe people in the city have given me a mission,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said then. The tax on the wealthy, he said, \u201cwas the No. 1 proposal I put forward in an election that I won with 73 percent of the vote.\u201d He added: \u201cI think the jury is in.\u201dIn an interview this week, Mr. Cuomo employed a phrase used by his father, Mario M. Cuomo, to characterize the mayor\u2019s push for a tax on the rich as aspirational, rather than realistic.\u201cThe way we campaign is in poetry, aspirational generalizations,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cWe govern in prose, which is in compromise and programs. The millionaires tax is a great political theme; it\u2019s a great proposal politically. It is governmentally, currently, an impossibility.\u201dMr. Cuomo said that political reality extends to the present-day battle over how to finance transit system improvements, with the mayor again calling for a tax on high earners.\u201cWe know that\u2019s not a real proposal,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cAt one point, government has to function.\u201d\u201cIt was absolutely a race to the finish line,\u201d he said.Other challenges included the last-minute cancellation or postponement of 45 programs that set off a scramble to relocate children signed up for those schools. But in general, the initiative won praise.\u201cWe know pre-K worked,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at the recent news conference. \u201cA lot of folks said it couldn\u2019t be done, it couldn\u2019t be done that quickly, it couldn\u2019t reach every child. Guess what? It all happened.\u201d He added, \u201c3-K is the next wave.\u201dAs with the first prekindergarten project, Mr. de Blasio does not have the money to pay for this expansion and will need to appeal to the state and federal government for financing. But unlike the mad dash to carry out the prekindergarten plan, he intends to put the 3-K program in place gradually, hoping to avoid earlier mistakes. He has started city-financed pilot programs in several districts, chosen because classroom space was readily available.But the prekindergarten experience, and much of what has followed, has shown that Albany can be the hot griddle that Mr. de Blasio must dance on. Over the last three years, the mayor has been tortured over his control of city schools and his push for more affordable housing.\u201cHowever they get there, at the end of the day if we get him to the right place and he\u2019s supportive of the kinds of things we\u2019re trying to do, I think that\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Shorris said of the governor. \u201cBut are there going to be bumps along the way? Yeah, sure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fear of Federal Debt Has Faded, but Risks Remain", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government learned over the last half-century that it could run up a much larger debt than experts had previously considered prudent or even possible.Every dollar of federal borrowing clearly imposes real economic costs, starting with the basic obligation to make regular interest payments, including to foreign investors.But the extent of additional costs is an unresolved question. If deficits are relatively benign, it would strengthen the case for near-term borrowing to increase growth.Federal borrowing has increased sharply. From the mid-1950s until the global financial crisis in 2008, the debt never exceeded half of the nation\u2019s annual economic output. As of June, it stood at around 75 percent of that output. And even without new tax cuts or spending increases, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the debt will reach 106 percent of output over the next two decades, setting a record as an aging population strains federal retirement and health care programs.The amount owed to investors is $14.4 trillion. That\u2019s already a record, but economists prefer to measure the debt in relation to the economy. The United States can afford a larger debt as the economy grows, just as millionaires can afford larger mortgages.As the federal debt rose in the 1980s, and again in the early 2000s, so did the chorus of dire warnings: Inflation and interest rates would rise, economic growth would falter \u2014 and, at some point, the markets might simply refuse to finance the federal government over concerns it would be unable to pay its bills.This time around, even those who regard the debt as a real and present danger have become more cautious about the presentation of those arguments. They say policy makers simply can\u2019t know when markets might begin to demand higher rates.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a measure of how much fiscal space we have, but a good political metric is to see how far we are from a record-high level of debt,\u201d said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group whose name describes its views.He noted that the debt was on a pace to exceed the high point reached after World War II. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the business of testing how far we can go,\u201d he said.The problem confronting those who want the government to reduce annual deficits is that the short-term consequences of profligacy have proved to be very modest, while the political benefits are substantial.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a political scientist to understand that taking stuff away is a lot less popular than giving stuff out,\u201d Mr. Goldwein said.Low interest rates have greatly reduced the government\u2019s borrowing costs. Measured as a share of the national economy, the federal debt is about three times as large as in the 1960s, but by the same measure, the interest payments are about the same.Interest payments are still projected to total $6 trillion over the next decade. And one thing that has changed: 40 percent of the debt is now held by foreign investors.The impact of federal borrowing on the rest of the economy is harder to assess.Economists warned for decades that deficits caused inflation and reduced the amount of money available to the private sector, ultimately reducing growth and prosperity.The years under President Ronald Reagan suggested that those theories needed some work. As federal deficits ballooned, inflation declined \u2014 and all the while the economy grew.\u201cReagan proved that deficits don\u2019t matter,\u201d Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002, as the George W. Bush administration pursued a similar fiscal policy with roughly the same results.The economist Robert Mundell had predicted all of this in the early 1970s, offering an alternative to the standard theory that came to be known as supply-side economics.He argued that the government should cut taxes to stimulate the economy, then raise interest rates to attract foreign investment, offsetting the increased federal borrowing.\u201cSuppose it does mean a budget deficit in the United States,\u201d he declared at the 1971 conference where he first presented the proposal. \u201cWho cares?\u201dWhen he was asked in the 1970s, Mr. Mundell predicted the money would come from the Saudis. In the 1980s, it came from the Japanese. In the 2000s, it came from the Chinese. The one constant has been a sufficient supply of money.Other economists still see evidence that government borrowing weighs on the economy by reducing the money available for investment. This \u201ccrowding out\u201d reduces the progress of productivity, which in turn suppresses the growth of incomes \u2014 a fairly straight line from more federal debt to less money in the average American wallet.As the fear of debt has faded, both parties in recent years have embraced proposals to stimulate the economy at the cost of larger short-term deficits. Democrats have backed increased investment in infrastructure, education and research. Republicans argue that the government should simply leave more money in private hands.Douglas Elmendorf, who led the Congressional Budget Office from 2009 to 2015, repeatedly predicted then that increased federal borrowing would pinch the economy. He said the failure of those predictions suggested there was room to borrow.\u201cThe economy has recovered and interest rates have not risen, and that has caused a great deal of reflection and analysis,\u201d said Mr. Elmendorf, who is now the dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. \u201cThe widespread conclusion is that interest rates are likely to stay below historical norms for an extended period.\u201dMr. Elmendorf said the government in the long term still faced a difficult choice of some combination of raising taxes and reducing entitlements. It would be easiest to start soon so those changes can be made gradually. He noted that changes to the Social Security program passed in 1983 are still taking effect 34 years later.In the short term, he said, the government should focus less on increasing overall economic growth than on improving the prospects of lower-income households.Daniel Shaviro, a law professor at New York University, wrote a book called \u201cDo Deficits Matter?\u201d in the mid-1990s, back when most people thought the answer was yes. Today, he said, he worries that people are becoming too confident the answer is no.He said the larger risks were real. If the debt continues to rise, \u201cthere\u2019s a pretty good chance that something bad is going to happen at some point,\u201d Mr. Shaviro said. \u201cAnd you\u2019d rather turn the wheel slowly and gradually rather than stopping abruptly.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

In the United States, women hold only 25 percent of executive or senior-level management roles, 20 percent of board roles and 6 percent of C.E.O. roles. The women\u2019s movement needs to strengthen its efforts toward legislative support for equal pay and equal opportunity.From health care and equal pay to reproductive rights and immigration, there is no shortage of issues facing women today. The Times wants to hear from you on how these issues affects you.I left corporate America for the simple reason that I was conscious of being paid less than my male counterparts for the same role and had fewer opportunities for advancement. I am very confident that I am not the only woman who has faced a similar decision. Now as I look at the still long career ahead of me, I recognize that what I am missing is advocacy and mentorship.

These are very relevant, pressing issues in the global arena and Myanmar. These issues are not going away. Our women and children should not have to fear for their safety and security.Over the next year, and in the future, I would like to see increased awareness and public acceptance of gender equality, and the cultural norms that are hindering our women from reaching their true potential.

Being a young woman, I face oppressive economic, social and political realities daily. An inclusive women\u2019s movement can support me in reclaiming my rights as an equal valuable human.We need to redefine the public perception of feminism. Feminism shouldn\u2019t mean different things according to which women we are talking about or where they are located. It should break elitism and be as egalitarian in its approach as it is in its purpose.Katharina Schmitt32, San FranciscoI\u2019d love to see the women\u2019s movement make progress on creating the right environment for women to flourish in. For me that is supportive, open-minded, welcomes diversity in every form and rewards ideas and performance over gender. I\u2019d also love for the women\u2019s movement to fuel greater access to high-quality child care, enable back-to-work support systems and improve parental leave policies, so that family and a successful and meaningful career are not an \u201ceither or,\u201d but rather a question of balance and timing.The women\u2019s movement provides a supportive voice and diverse community to surface ideas, organize thoughts and prioritize topics on a global level. One of my favorite proverbs says: \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d Role models and female peers inspire, support and challenge me.

In fact, I would even refer to it as my Get Out of Jail Free card. Just as this card can provide you with a lifeline when you are in tough job situations, it can also propel you forward and help you with your next strategic move. Mentors and sponsors can act as important advisers, allies and fast-track partners to getting ahead.The women\u2019s movement has already demonstrated their exemplary track record in becoming the go-to international women\u2019s movement for career advancement and development. For the coming year it would be great to see it grow further in membership numbers and become a household name on the international level.Lea von Bidder27, San FranciscoChief executive, Ava ScienceWe\u2019ve all become accustomed to slow but steady progress when it comes to women\u2019s issues. But today, for the first time, that continuous progress is at risk because of unforeseen political changes, especially here in the United States. It is important that the women\u2019s movement speak with one voice and isn\u2019t weakened by inconsistencies from within. We need to stop questioning and policing the women\u2019s movement and its members. Everyone who supports equality between women and men should be part of it. What I want the women\u2019s movement to accomplish next year is to find unity and a strong, common voice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Investors Can\u2019t Get Enough of Tajikistan\u2019s Debt", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For decades, it\u2019s been a rite of autumn: Finance ministers and central bankers from economically struggling countries arrive here for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s meetings, seeking cash infusions or bailouts from the world\u2019s richest nations.Now that tradition is being upended. Countries like Ukraine, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan still need the money. They\u2019ve just found a much more relaxed lender: investors who, in an era of rock-bottom interest rates, are searching far and wide for risky assets that will churn out decent returns.So, while government officials from those countries dutifully attended their meetings at I.M.F. headquarters last week, submitting to the usual lectures about keeping their spending in check, their bigger priority was pitching their debts to major investors at packed conferences organized by J. P. Morgan, Bank of America and the Institute of International Finance, the trade group for the global banking industry.\u201cNigeria is ready for business,\u201d said Okwu Joseph Nnanna, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, who urged a room of investors at one gathering to take advantage of the rich interest rates attached to his country\u2019s government bonds.The governor of the central bank of Egypt, Tarek Amer, was even more bullish. He bragged to the crowd of financiers that Egypt\u2019s tough economic reforms and stable currency had lured billions of dollars into the country.\u201cInvestors are feeling good \u2014 we have had $20 billion come into Egypt over the past year,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe money is pouring in.\u201d\u201cThese easy financial conditions might last for a while, but the longer they last the more the vulnerabilities build up,\u201d said Tobias Adrian, who heads the I.M.F.\u2019s monetary and capital markets division. \u201cThe impulse is to lever up when times are good, and we want to lean against that.\u201dEmerging market stocks and bonds have been popular with investors for nearly a year now, because of successful economic reforms and stable currencies.But the rush into the bonds of higher-risk developing nations shows just how short memories can be in the financial world.Mongolia, for example, was a darling of the investment community before commodity prices collapsed in 2014 and 2015. Now the country\u2019s bonds are being restructured because the government is short of funds. And it was not that long ago that Greece, even with its towering debt load, was an investor favorite.Ground zero for this mash-up between finance ministers flogging bonds and yield-starved investors looking to buy them was the lobby of the Mayflower Hotel in downtown Washington.That was where Joyce Chang, J. P. Morgan\u2019s head of global research and a pioneer in emerging market bond investing, was holding the investment bank\u2019s traditional bond jamboree, timed to coincide with the fund\u2019s twice-a-year meetings.Harried central bankers and finance ministers rushed in and out of the hotel lobby, trailing entourages of aides and security guards as their black town cars idled by the curb. After the presentations, coifed hedge fund managers \u2014 when they were not tackling the buffet of grilled flank steak, chili lime chicken and dainty tarts \u2014 converged on them with questions.On Thursday, rooms overflowing with eager listeners heard pitches from the finance minister of Brazil, whose country\u2019s economy is recovering, and the head of the central bank of Argentina, which has become an investor favorite after it recently issued a bond that doesn\u2019t mature for 100 years. The response from the floor was ebullient, with one investor pressing Brazil\u2019s finance chief, Henrique Meirelles, on whether he planned to run for president.What distinguishes this emerging market bond rally from others, bankers and economists say, is the extent to which it is being led by less financially mature markets like the Ivory Coast, Iraq and Suriname, which in the past have relied on credit from institutions such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank to finance government spending initiatives.This year, lower-income emerging economies are expected to issue close to $10 billion in government bonds, according to the I.M.F., more than the past two years combined.Of all of them, a recent $500 million bond offering by Tajikistan, a landlocked former Soviet republic that has rarely interacted with global investors, was the most curious. Tajikistan is paying investors an interest rate of just over 7 percent for 10 years, and the deal was a quick and easy sell for the country\u2019s bankers, with demand several times the amount of money secured.The half-billion dollars raised is especially staggering when compared with the size of Tajikistan\u2019s economy. The cash influx represents 7 percent of its gross domestic product and dwarfs the $74 million the country holds in foreign exchange reserves.\u201cWe were all scratching our heads over that one,\u201d said Brett A. Rowley, an emerging market bond investor at TCW in Los Angeles, which passed on the Tajikistan bonds.For his part, Mr. Rowley loves Egyptian Treasury bills. He promoted them on an investor panel at the Institute of International Finance\u2019s conference, touting their mouthwatering yields and the strength of the Egyptian pound. After the panel, he cornered Mr. Amer, the Egyptian central bank head, and said, \u201cI told everyone: Buy more T bills!\u201dOther countries are looking to dig into this fertile ground.\u201cWe have seen a lot interest in Sri Lankan paper,\u201d said P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the deputy governor of the Sri Lankan central bank. So bullish are investors about Sri Lanka, Mr. Weerasinghe said, that some are even asking that the country issue 30-year bonds. Earlier this year, Sri Lanka sold $1.5 billion in 10-year bonds and Mr. Weerasinghe said there was investor demand for seven times that amount.Mr. Nnanna, Nigeria\u2019s deputy central bank governor, said he was gearing up for a round of meetings with Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and Bank of America.The Nigerian economy has been hit hard by the drop in the price of oil and is increasingly reliant on foreign borrowing to pay for government expenditures. Earlier this year, Nigeria issued a $1 billion, 15-year bond. Demand far outstripped supply. \u201cWe are ready to issue bonds for 20 years now,\u201d Mr. Nnanna said.In the past, these frenzies often ended in pain for all. Explaining why his bonds are a safe bet, Mr. Nnanna repeated a notorious maxim attributed to Walter B. Wriston, the chief executive of Citibank \u2014 made at the onset of the Latin American debt crisis in the early 1980s.\u201cSovereign nations don\u2019t go bankrupt,\u201d Mr. Nnanna said. \u201cAnd we are a sovereign nation.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the Egyptian currency. It is the pound, not the lira.Advertisement"}

Chenault, one of the longest-serving executives in finance and one of corporate America\u2019s few black top leaders, will retire next year as the chairman and chief executive of American Express.Under Mr. Chenault\u2019s leadership, American Express expanded beyond its core market of corporate customers and wealthy cardholders to serve a broader clientele. The co-branding deals he sought out with airlines and large retailers helped the company become the credit card issuer with the highest customer spending in the United States.\u201cI\u2019ve treasured every day of my 37-year career here,\u201d Mr. Chenault, 66, said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s been a journey that spanned profound changes in the world of business.\u201dMr. Chenault, the son of a dentist, joined American Express nearly four decades ago as a director of strategic planning and rose to become the company\u2019s top executive in 2001. He has been the lone African-American at the helm of a big Wall Street firm since E. Stanley O\u2019Neal stepped down as the chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch a decade ago, at the start of the financial crisis.He will be succeeded by Stephen J. Squeri, 58, who has been the company\u2019s vice chairman since 2015. Mr. Squeri will take Mr. Chenault\u2019s place on Feb. 1.In many ways, American Express came to define cachet in the credit card world, with its ubiquitous green card and mottos like \u201cMembership Has Its Privileges.\u201d For much of his run, Mr. Chenault parlayed exclusivity and status into strong profit growth and a soaring stock. From the end of 2001, revenues grew from around $21 billion to about $34 billion in 2014.But the company struggled in recent years.Others have horned in on American Express\u2019s traditional territory, offering increasingly lavish rewards to attract high spenders. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card initially courted millennials with a large sign-up bonus of 100,000 points and a slew of benefits, attracting a wave of applications.The company also lost two prominent deals, with Costco and JetBlue. Rivals had offered them better terms.That competition hit the company\u2019s finances. Revenues dropped in 2015 and 2016. Its shares sputtered.Trying to regain the company\u2019s footing, Mr. Chenault increased its focus on areas like international and small business customers. Its Small Business Saturday campaign became a mainstay of the \u201cbuy local\u201d movement.It also sought out new deals targeting affluent travelers. In June, it scored a coup and teamed up with Hilton, for which it will be the exclusive issuer next year.Mr. Chenault\u2019s revamped approach has begun to rekindle investors\u2019 faith: After a yearslong slide, the company\u2019s stock price rose 50 percent over the past year. Over his full tenure, American Express\u2019s stock returns have outpaced those of the financial sector.He described the company\u2019s efforts over the last two years as a \u201cturnaround,\u201d and said that Mr. Squeri was the right choice to move the business forward.Mr. Chenault\u2019s departure was widely expected, and the ascendance of Mr. Squeri, a 32-year company veteran, is unsurprising. Mr. Squeri has run a variety of business lines at the company, including its corporate card division.\u201cKen is a pioneer who set the standard for great leadership and quietly mentored and inspired generations of executives across many industries,\u201d said Charles Phillips, a onetime software analyst who is now chief executive of the technology company Infor.\u201cHe\u2019s had an exceptional run,\u201d said Bruce Gordon, a former president and chief executive of the N.A.A.C.P. and a friend of Mr. Chenault\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s been a steward of a great global brand.

{"Headline": "Our Stupid Gun Debate", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ConversationConservatives often say that the way to stop mass shootings isn\u2019t by limiting access to weapons, but by doing more to make sure mentally ill people don\u2019t get their hands on them. It\u2019s a weak argument. For starters, even the most competent government agency would be hard-pressed to spot and stop deranged people \u2014 whose dark fantasies occur in the proverbial dark \u2014 before their rampages. And then you have these same conservatives block efforts to stop crazy people from purchasing guns on the grounds that they mustn\u2019t have their Second Amendment rights removed without due process.So the only way for the makers and dealers to grow is by selling the idea that you need every new wrinkle. Like silencers or, God help us, bump stocks.Don\u2019t resign yourself to the idea that this will never change, Gail. A good argument is always worth making.Let\u2019s switch to a subject we can fight about. I know I can always drive you crazy by insulting Lindsey Graham. Last week he introduced a Senate bill to ban abortions at 20 weeks. We haven\u2019t really discussed abortion much \u2014 do you think Senator Graham\u2019s fighting the good fight or trying to impose his religious principles on the rest of the nation?Otherwise, I subscribe to Bill Clinton\u2019s line that abortion ought to be safe, legal and rare. It\u2019s great that the abortion rate has this year dropped to its lowest rate since abortion became legal nationally in 1973. That\u2019s thanks in large part to the vastly greater availability of contraception \u2014 another reminder that cultural conservatives often advocate positions that are at cross-purposes with their stated intentions.Also people like Graham are interfering with painful decisions that are often made by couples who are eager to have a baby but discover late in the pregnancy that the fetus is terribly compromised and won\u2019t survive if carried to term.Let\u2019s switch the subject to the Corker-Trump feud. The president\u2019s relationship with Senate Republicans reminds me a bit of Prince Charles\u2019s marriage to Diana Spencer. We knew it was bad, but it took a while to figure out how bad. Corker\u2019s disdain for the president isn\u2019t revealing for what it says just about him, but probably about the Republican caucus as well.Corker\u2019s a very important figure on foreign policy matters. I wonder how his rebellion will affect Trump\u2019s attempt to get out of the Iran compact. What, by the way, do you think about the withdrawal idea? I think it\u2019s crazy \u2014 we made the Iran deal along with our partners in the developed world, and none of them is going to resume the sanctions.As with anything and everything Trump, we\u2019re being asked to take a ride with a drunken driver: we may need desperately to get to a destination, but there are no guarantees of getting there alive.Back to Iran. I think everyone agrees the Iranian deal is imperfect. Three arguments against ditching it.One is that Iran\u2019s enemies overstate Iran\u2019s unique \u2026 evildoerness. It\u2019s true that they finance terrorism in their neighborhood. So do many of the richest and most powerful people in Saudi Arabia. ISIS isn\u2019t an Iranian production.Second, the only way for us to survive over the long run in this incredibly dangerous world is by working together with other nations that hold the same basic values we do. If we drop out of this international agreement, we turn our backs on our allies and we undermine the spirit of cooperation that all of our recent presidents have worked so hard to cultivate.Third, it won\u2019t do any good. Allies will continue to do business with Iran, whatever power the bargain has over Iranian nuclear development is weakened.Three strikes and you\u2019re out.Iran is in a class by itself in the awfulness department. It openly vows to annihilate another U.N. member state. It provides financial and military support to terrorist groups both Shiite (Hezbollah) and Sunni (Hamas). It campaigns against ISIS but gave shelter to Al Qaeda. It continues to arm Shiite killing squads in Iraq. It is Bashar al-Assad\u2019s best friend in his genocidal campaign against his own people. It has the death of hundreds of American soldiers in Lebanon and Iraq on its hands. It has conducted terror attacks as far away as Argentina and tried to blow up a restaurant in Washington in order to assassinate the Saudi ambassador. It denies the existence of gay people within its borders and then hangs them when it finds them. It holds Holocaust denial conferences and cartoon competitions.I don\u2019t think it is out of the question that we can get our allies to be tougher on the enforcement front, even if we don\u2019t renegotiate the deal itself (which would require Iranian consent). We still have the whip hand, since we can make companies like the French energy giant Total or the German engineering firm Siemens choose between doing business in the United States or in Iran.I agree that we need to be mindful of our alliances, but this agreement was never ratified by the Senate and doesn\u2019t have the status of a treaty. And, ultimately, we are better off in a world in which Iran doesn\u2019t have a bomb and the European diplomatic corps hates us than one in which the reverse is true.Told you I was conservative!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sight and Insight in the California Desert", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "The artist Andrea Zittel has spent nearly 20 years exploring solitude. Now, she\u2019s inviting others to join her.Supported byOn my second evening alone in the California high desert, I realize how much I\u2019m looking forward to lighting the glass oil lamp. My home for this scorchingly hot week in June is a one-room cabin without electricity or running water that my host, the artist Andrea Zittel, has purposefully left nearly bare, and I\u2019m craving the flame\u2019s intricate shadow, the only baroque fillip in this spartan interior. As daylight drains from the wide, empty plain outside the uncurtained windows, and the darkness makes the uncanny quiet feel even more silent, I fall into a brief reverie about the human hunger for ornamentation and the expressionlessness of my electric lamps back home. Mundane revelations, perhaps, but insights into the ordinary are the point of living in this spare box tucked into a landscape as strange and sweltering as Venus, with little to occupy me but uninterrupted thoughts about how I conduct every bit of my life, down to the way I brush my teeth or wipe my hands on a dish towel.Like her predecessors, Zittel\u2019s material is also the Southwestern desert, but she isn\u2019t a land artist in the traditional mode: Instead of moving earth with giant machines, or leaving hulking, unpeopled abstractions amid the dust, she employs this vast landscape to explore and challenge the quotidian functions of our existence. She was trained as a sculptor and still considers herself one, but her art is really a kind of philosophical quest, one that involves an ongoing and intense examination of what it means to live: What do we really mean when we say we need shelter, community, clothes, tools, light? How elaborate a space \u2014 indeed, how much space, down to the millimeter \u2014 do we need to survive, to thrive? What structures best facilitate creativity, serenity, unity?What makes Zittel\u2019s art seem so urgent at this moment is that the culture appears to have caught up to her at last: In our era of rapidly shifting domestic arrangements, nearly everyone \u2014 young people living alone or aging couples in communal compounds \u2014 seems badly served by architecture designed for the increasingly vestigial nuclear family. The cultish Marie Kondo\u2019s admonitions to cast out the nonessential seems ripped from Zittel\u2019s playbook; the conceptual underpinnings for the swelling phalanx of tiny, modular dwellings that evade byzantine zoning regulations and create a more mobile society can be found in Zittel\u2019s experiments as well.During her nearly two decades in the barren, windswept wasteland, her practice has gone from an isolated curiosity to a complete operational community constructed to outlive her, a \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass\u201d laboratory that reflects our contemporary fascination with the spaces in which we live. From ur-furniture that makes even the concept of a chair seem quaint, to vessels that force us to question the notion of a drinking glass, Zittel\u2019s work reminds us that the elemental building blocks of human society are ultimately domestic \u2014 and that revolution begins in private.\u201cI don\u2019t want people to be uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t want them to feel comfortable, either,\u201d Zittel tells me. \u201cYou know when you\u2019re alone with yourself and you feel jangly and on edge? But in a way that\u2019s the most cathartic thing in the world? Almost painful, but so good?\u201dWe are discussing my stay in the \u201cExperimental Living Cabins\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m on day four of seven \u2014 in the kitchen of Zittel\u2019s home, which is in the center of A-Z West and has, over the years, been expanded from a shack into a chic, colorful oasis filled with her own designs, including 2011\u2019s \u201cAggregated Stacks\u201d (wall shelves made from plaster-covered cardboard shipping boxes from Amazon) and \u201cLinear Sequence\u201d (2016), a low-to-the-ground sculpture of tabletops and floor cushions that functions as a living room. She shares it with her 13-year-old son, Emmett, and a menagerie that includes three dogs, a cat, six chickens, four rescue pigeons, three rescue tortoises and three fish.Zittel is 52, 5-foot-6, and lanky, with shoulder-length reddish-brown hair she often pulls back in a long braid. For decades, she\u2019s worn the same outfit every day for a predetermined period \u2014 she\u2019s been wearing her current one for about three months \u2014 an extension of \u201cA-Z Uniforms,\u201d a work she began back in Brooklyn. When I visited, she\u2019d been too busy to finish assembling that summer\u2019s ensemble, so was still in her spring getup \u2014 a black sleeveless muscle tee, a floor-length black denim A-line skirt and black Birkenstocks. There were thin black onyx rings on all of her fingers; her bare arms were those of someone who regularly lifts heavy objects. Based on her minimalist, cerebral aesthetic, I\u2019d expected her to be austere and aloof. But as I watched her make the rounds of the property, conferring with assistants and checking on the artists bent over the kiln, she projected a regal serenity, asking questions and waiting patiently for the answer before responding in a cadence she once conceded has a bit of Valley Girl in it. The Brooklyn-based artist Rachel Harrison, who has known Zittel for 20 years, since they both lived in Williamsburg, calls her \u201clegendarily generous,\u201d especially to young artists, several hundred of whom have spent time at A-Z West over the years.But Zittel\u2019s own work is always the soul of the machine. In 2004 she started the \u201cWagon Station Encampment,\u201d 12 domed aluminum-clad units around a central outdoor kitchen that marry the proportions of a frontier-era covered wagon with the modernity of a Subaru Outback; there is just enough space for one person to sleep or sit up, and a few hooks for personal items. Over the years, during which dozens of artists have stayed in them for weeks at a time, she has assiduously maintained the wagons, two early versions of which are owned by the Guggenheim; from a distance, they gleam like fallen satellites in a lunar terrain. Several months ago, she opened her latest permanent site-specific work, \u201cPlanar Pavilions,\u201d a loose grid of 10 configurations of black-painted cinder-block walls of varying heights \u2014 some low enough to sit on, others as tall and imposing as linebackers \u2014 along a gentle slope, which calls to mind the crumbled foundations of a future civilization as well as the constellation of concrete boxes Donald Judd installed in the early 1980s on his own property in Marfa, Tex.I have driven west to see her from the \u201cExperimental Living Cabins,\u201d set on 15 acres a 40-minute drive away in Wonder Valley, a desolate, unincorporated corner of the Mojave Desert, near the joyless sprawl of Twentynine Palms, home to one of the largest military training areas in the country. Zittel started buying up acreage to add to her holdings several years ago, attracted by the site\u2019s remoteness and the several ramshackle \u201cjackrabbit homesteads\u201d on the property (really, little more than a dusty patch of desert), relics of the Small Tract Act of 1938, which lured pioneers to \u201cprove up\u201d five acres. (The terrain is so inhospitable that few actually stayed.) She now owns three of the cabins, though only two are renovated: simple board-and-batten structures, painted gray with white trim, that stand alone amid the scrub brush, 600 feet apart in the wide, flat basin rimmed in the distance by purpled mountains. She originally intended to use them for herself \u2014 ironically, between occasional afternoon visitors and the residents who come for longer stays in exchange for help with site maintenance, A-Z West is such a hive these days that Zittel rarely has the alone time she craves \u2014 but like most elements in her life, the cabins have become part of her work, perhaps even the ultimate expression of it.When she bought the land in Wonder Valley, she was in the midst of making a series of sculptures called \u201cPlanar Configurations,\u201d based on her longstanding fascination with the \u201cplanar panel\u201d \u2014 basically, anything that is rectangular, whether a 4-by-8 piece of plywood, a 8\u00bd-by-11 sheet of printer paper or a table top. Each sculpture, made of wood, red fiberglass and black-matte aluminum or steel, is a set of interconnected rectangles, like a 3D Mondrian, that function as a table, bed, counter and room divider. Last year, Zittel, always frustrated by how few people actually get to interact with her work, and ever on the lookout for ways to finance her many projects, had a revelation: She could put a \u201cPlanar Configuration\u201d inside each of the cabins, and allow people to stay in them, for rates comparable to a nearby Airbnb. It would be the first time that a stranger could reside in Zittel\u2019s universe full time, in utter privacy, in contrast to the \u201cWagon Station Encampment\u201d with its communal ethos and group activities.The \u201cExperimental Living Cabins,\u201d at which I am one of the first guests, are intended for solo visitors who stay anywhere from two days to three weeks, and though a smattering of boxy one-story houses dot the area, they are so low, and so distant, that it\u2019s easy to forget they exist at all. One can go for days without human interaction, or one can hop in the car and drive down the dirt road to the Palms Restaurant for a beer. The point of the cabins isn\u2019t to enact the now-clich\u00e9d off-the-grid adventure, but to exist just a few steps outside real life, in a stripped-down but completely functional environment \u2014 to re-examine, even relearn, everyday activities. A welcome disorientation, even an epiphany or two, might arise from doing without conventional touchstones like, say, a mirror, or a refrigerator. (Visitors are given a supply of bottled water, but bring in their own food and ice to stock the cooler.)And there is plenty of furniture in the literal sense, just not anything that reads easily as such. \u201cI do believe in a certain amount of comfort,\u201d Zittel says. \u201cI believe in having a good spot to position your body so you can relax and do things. But I want people to find their own comfort without being catered to. It\u2019s not just waiting there for you.\u201dShe is intimately familiar with the comfortable-uncomfortable sensation that the cabins can evoke; it characterized her early years in the desert. When Zittel left Brooklyn in 2000, many in the art world viewed it as a surprising retrenchment or even the end of her career. She had spent almost a decade represented by the acclaimed Andrea Rosen Gallery, showing such apparently urban-inflected works as the 1994 \u201cA-Z Living Units,\u201d a precursor to the \u201cPlanar Configurations\u201d \u2014 portable pods that seemed inspired by cramped studios: Barbie\u2019s-Dreamhouse-by-way-of-Bauhaus.Although she had grown up north of San Diego and spent time at her grandparents\u2019 ranch in California\u2019s Imperial Valley, she didn\u2019t yearn for the wilderness in her 10 years in New York. There were no signs in her work of the organic monumentalism synonymous with the sculptors and conceptualists who first decamped for the desert, and she didn\u2019t seem the type to erect a permanent museum of her art, as did the assemblage artist Noah Purifoy, a pioneer when he left L.A. for Joshua Tree in the 1980s. Nor did she give indications of wanting to create a conventional home and burrow into a solitary relationship with two-dimensional work, as had the female artists who famously forsook New York City for the Southwest, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Agnes Martin. She was social, hosting weekly cocktail parties in her Williamsburg townhouse.But as others began discovering Brooklyn, she began feeling a pull toward the sun-blasted, desolate terrain of her childhood. Zittel sees herself as part of the 20th-century tradition of American artists leaving cities for the open spaces of the Southwest, but she is aware of her deviations. O\u2019Keeffe and Martin chose the desert as a form of retreat, but Zittel saw it as liberation. As for the parallels often drawn between her and the largely male artists who came to make their massive, macho marks on the desert, she gently notes that she is not interested in \u201cgrand interventions,\u201d only in finding meaning in intimate, everyday gestures. \u201cThe act of inhabiting and having an evolving relationship with a space or place is inherently different from the act of installing works like \u2018Spiral Jetty\u2019 or \u2018Double Negative,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says.During my stay in the cabin, I established a routine determined by the movements of the sun: After daylight nudged me awake around five, I rose from the bed portion of the \u201cPlanar Configuration\u201d and unlocked both doors to let in the early cross-breeze. Then I scooped ant corpses from the ice cooler and retrieved my sack of ground coffee. I checked my shoes for scorpions/tarantulas, and stepped outside to the composting toilet. I\u2019d save the outdoor shower \u2014 a water tank modified with a hand pump \u2014 for later in the day, when the heat was unbearable. Then it was off to assess the dwindling freshwater reserve and to conduct frugal ablutions over a steel sink that drained through a black hose into a bucket below. I filled the kettle. Ignited the propane stove. Set out French press, bowl and spoon. (In keeping with Zittel\u2019s catechism, there are only bowls, never glasses or plates, which she deems unnecessarily use-specific.) Carried two black wooden vintage stools out to the patio, one for sitting, the other for my breakfast and books. Every time a bead of perspiration rolled down my leg, I\u2019d assume it was an ant and tried to flick it off, never learning.In the afternoon, the hot wind in my face like a blow dryer on high, I drove to the air-conditioned local library, with Zittel\u2019s blessing; the cabin stay is meant to be challenging but not life-threatening. Back home around 6:00 p.m., I cooked a meal of spiced beans, avocado and tortillas and washed up in the final sliver of sun. After lighting the oil lanterns, I watched their flickering patterns, then sat outside to read. By 9:30 p.m. I was asleep, atop white sheets, enveloped in unbroken darkness.Before my trip, I\u2019d been thinking about Zittel in relation to the social-utopia-makers of the 19th century, the \u201cmaterial feminists\u201d who sought liberation by transforming the domestic sphere. In 1868, Melusina Fay Peirce, an organizer and author, spearheaded the \u201ccooperative housekeeping movement,\u201d proposing that wives charge their husbands for their domestic labor. The writer and reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman argued for taking the kitchen out of the house, making it communal and hiring cooks to lessen the burden of \u201cwomen\u2019s work.\u201d Could Zittel\u2019s heady innovations be postmodern descendants of these ideas?But perched on a stool with the oil lamp and a book, the night astonishingly silent save for a lone coyote in the distance, I realized that Zittel isn\u2019t interested in changing society or achieving political or social perfection, but is instead seeking liberation of a more private sort. Because here\u2019s the strange thing: I never did get bored, or lonely, or restless during my stint in Zittel\u2019s world. For all my physical discomfort throughout the week, I felt deeply, supremely calm. Existing alone in an unfamiliar space in which every detail has been considered and honed to its ultimate function was simultaneously soothing and stimulating. Engaged so closely with my immediate surroundings, I was able to drown out my ever-present anxieties. Bowls were no longer just bowls: They were the sole necessary vessel. Without a chair back, I sat up taller and lay down on the ground to watch the stars. I began to see the cabins as performance art, but with the artist herself absent \u2014 or, maybe, with the viewer taking the artist\u2019s role. There was a kind of generosity, or trust, in that gesture.In the days and weeks following, long after I returned home, I saw rectangles everywhere \u2014 counter, bed, ceiling, blanket, book, cover, page. Even a line of text is a long, narrow rectangle. Viewed like this, through Zittel\u2019s eyes, the material world seemed endlessly malleable, little more than a sequence of man-made conventions we\u2019ve all agreed to preserve, whether or not they have outlived their usefulness, that were now merely burying \u2014 or distracting \u2014 us with infinite variety.Advertisement"}

Even among Republicans, there appears to be little appetite to do that, at least for now.The economic angle:If the Trump administration\u2019s actions make European banks fearful of lending billions to Iran to build new refineries, or expand other economic links with the West, it may fuel opposition to the deal inside Iran.Sales of the firearm accessory that the Las Vegas gunman used to modify his rifles jumped this week, causing some companies to sell out of the so-called bump stocks even as Walmart and Cabela\u2019s stripped them from their websites.The rush to buy bump stocks started Wednesday, when gun enthusiasts expressed concern on social media that bump stocks would either sell out or become illegal after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives linked them to the Las Vegas attack.The surpriseWhat they agree onCorporate tax rates need to be cut because of global competition.

Many community banks used to offer payday-like loans but stopped doing so in 2013 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a key banking regulator, issued a bulletin discouraging the products. On Thursday, the office unexpectedly repealed that guidance, citing the new consumer bureau rules.The lender was accused of paying about 300 female employees less than men in the same positions.It also faced allegations that it paid 15 black executives less than white employees in the same positions.State Street, a financial services firm, denies the allegations, according to the agreement.

At the same time, New York City is spending about a billion dollars to reduce sewage discharge into the canal and street flooding around it.Most important, the city is preparing to unleash a force held largely at bay for the first two decades of the Gowanus renaissance: residential development. Next year, officials expect to propose a broad plan that calls for, among other things, rezoning 43 blocks to allow more buildings like the 12-story high-rise complex on Bond Street across from the Venice graffiti (a one-off that required its own special rezoning).All this along a sickly body of sluggish, often fetid water that despite years of fitful improvements (the herons and striped bass are back again) still seems like the last place a person might want to live.Getting everything done will be difficult. Doing it while preserving the neighborhood\u2019s patchwork charms \u2014 the artist studios and craft-makers, the surviving heavy industry, the hypnotic, sulfur-scented quiet of the canal on a Sunday morning \u2014 might be impossible.\u201cThere\u2019s the sense along the canal that the person who moved here discovered it,\u201d he said, \u201cand that their discovery is the truest one.\u201d\u201cThis is not Gowanus,\u201d said Ms. Mariano, a retired art teacher who bought a fixer-upper on President Street in 1974. She brushed past a beach rose in a planter. \u201cThis is not the beach,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be retreating from the water, not creating an artificial utopia.\u201dThe neighborhood should refit old industrial buildings for small manufacturers and artists, Ms. Mariano said. \u201cWhat Gowanus had \u2014 and still has to a certain extent \u2014 is what America used to be,\u201d she said. \u201cWe made things. We had jobs here, and people could live near where they worked.\u201dBut for people in the new building, this is home. The other day, Kate Eurich, 35, sat on a bench by the water with her Jack Russell terrier, Seamus.\u201cWe knew about the reputation of the canal,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we did the starter-apartment-in-New-York thing before. We didn\u2019t want to live someplace without A.C. or a dishwasher.\u201dAs for local jobs, Ms. Eurich\u2019s husband works at a marketing company across the canal on Nevins Street, where not long ago the main businesses were drugs and prostitution. She works from home as an analyst for an online rewards company.\u201cFor him it was the convenience,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me it was a brand-new building.\u201d The Welcome to Venice graffiti is a nice splash of local color.\u201cI can see it from my window,\u201d Ms. Eurich said. \u201c It makes me feel like I\u2019m living in Brooklyn a little bit.\u201dSo far, the two-block-long promenade is little used. This, however, makes it appealing to a crew of high-schoolers from all over the nicer parts of Brooklyn who converge after school to skateboard and chill.\u201cWe have a group chat and people say, \u2018Come to Venice,\u2019\u201d said Aidan McCaul, 14.Environmentalists and industries, developers and affordable-housing advocates and housing-project residents weighed in. Artists and makers whose long-undesirable studios are suddenly valuable seek protections like subsidized space in the new buildings. And the Gowanus Dredgers canoe club \u2014 the folks who took the seminarians out paddling \u2014 want more put-in spots.The zoning piece of this process will probably grind on for another two years. Officials expect the result to be complex even by the byzantine standards of such things: custom zoning, rather than one-size-fits-all.For example, the city might allow taller residential buildings on corners, while keeping things as they are on midblock sites with low-slung manufacturing buildings. Where there is already housing, the zoning might not change much, to discourage teardowns that would make tenants vulnerable.\u201cWe want to craft a very fine-grained zoning framework that pleases mostly everybody,\u201d said Winston Von Engel, director of the city planning office in Brooklyn.\u201cI saw this was changing,\u201d said Rich Lam, Property Market Group\u2019s principal for the Gowanus portfolio. \u201cI knew it had legs, and it\u2019s between some great residential neighborhoods.\u201dThe company has amassed nearly half a million square feet of prime acreage, including the building with the Venice graffiti, still used by its former owners as a garage for plumbers\u2019 trucks. Property Market Group also owns, or is buying, the ghostly remains of the Bayside Fuel Oil Co. and a food-truck parking lot between the ancient bridges on Union Street and Carroll Street.Mr. Lam estimates that his company\u2019s Gowanus projects could be done in five years, by which time the Superfund cleanup should be in full swing. The prospect of asking tenants to live beside the racket and stench of environmental remediation does not trouble him. Nor does the disintegrating state of the canal\u2019s bulkhead, which property owners will have to rebuild.Mr. Lam, who grew up in Carroll Gardens with a healthy fear of the canal, stood on the rust-scabbed Union Street drawbridge, long overdue for replacement. Could he see any reason, he was asked, that Gowanus\u2019s transformation would not proceed?\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. A minute later, as if on cue, a three-foot chunk of rotten wooden piling crumpled into the canal with a splash.The 2010 addition of the Gowanus to the federal Superfund list of the nation\u2019s worst hazardous waste sites followed more than a century of insult and injury at the hands of gas plants, chemical makers and tanneries.One sewage tank is to be built beneath a gravel lot where the city now stores road salt in a giant shed. It is here that the Gowanus Canal Conservancy hopes to build an education center at the hub of what it calls \u201cN.Y.C.\u2019s next great park,\u201d a network of oases strung one after another on both banks of the canal.The conservancy has planted a down payment on its vision: a tiny marsh of native grasses by the salt shed. \u201cEvery plug grew,\u201d said the group\u2019s director, Andrea Parker. \u201cSome of them were pulled out by geese, but that was the only mortality.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t been here since 1956!\u201d Patty Condello, a retired garbageman, yelled as he cut the motor.Back then, the men said, the canal water was black. \u201cAll you could see was a big cesspool,\u201d Mr. Condello said. \u201cAnd bubbles coming up,\u201d Mr. Franqui added.\u201cIt\u2019s changed a lot,\u201d Mr. Condello said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to believe.\u201dThe more industrial southern half of the canal zone, where artisans of the new Brooklyn have put down roots among the lumber yards and pickle distributors, is outside the district the city plans to rezone. But many people there are feeling vulnerable anyway.Despite all this commerce, it is only a matter of time, Mr. Young said, before he and his neighbors are pushed out.\u201cThere\u2019ll be no industry left here,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cThis is just counting days, or months, or a year or more. It will all be commercial \u2014 Starbucks and JCPenneys.\u201dCity planning officials say that a little more commercial development wouldn\u2019t hurt the industrial zone. \u201cYou need a place for people to buy a sandwich and coffee,\u201d Mr. Von Engel, of the city planning office, said.When the Dredgers were founded in 1999, they were widely regarded as kooks. But they believed the canal was worth saving, and they appealed to anyone they thought could help.The Dredgers testified in favor of the Lightstone Group\u2019s high-rise on Bond Street at land-use hearings. This earned them scorn in the neighborhood. But the site was largely abandoned, and that wasn\u2019t helping the canal, said Owen Foote, treasurer and co-founder of the Dredgers.\u201cWe felt that having people living in close proximity to the waterway was better than having a truck parking lot,\u201d he said.Lightstone was impressed by the Dredgers. \u201cWe felt they were playing a vital role in terms of revitalizing the canal,\u201d said Mitchell Hochberg, Lightstone\u2019s president.This is how the photos in the window of the leasing gallery at 365 Bond Street came to include, along with the usual shots of the roof deck and the stainless-steel kitchen appliances, one of a young couple canoeing on the canal.Mr. Foote\u2019s next plan is to see if the other high-rise next door will let him offer children\u2019s kayak lessons in the rooftop pool.It was not a special event, just a nice day. The line for ribs snaked almost back to the \u201cNo Fishing\u201d sign on the fence. Where did all these people come from? \u201cQueens, Williamsburg, a lot of Manhattanites, the Bronx,\u201d said the bouncer, Cam King.\u201cI was wondering that myself,\u201d said a man who grew up in the neighborhood when it was all Italian. \u201cThere\u2019s no one from Brooklyn in the place.\u201d The woman in line in front of him turned and said she had grown up a few blocks away. She was Samantha MacIvor, 40, a stuntwoman. He was John Musumeci, 60, a union carpenter. They got talking and figured out they\u2019d been neighbors for decades without meeting.\u201cOut the back of my building we could see each other!\u201d Mr. Musumeci said. \u201cDo you know Jerry Ears?\u201d Ms. MacIvor asked.Ms. MacIvor sat down with her ribs and rejoined her friends. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how the new people don\u2019t mind hanging out by the dirty canal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look at how pretty it is here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World Once Laughed at North Korean Cyberpower. No More.", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen North Korean hackers tried to steal $1 billion from the New York Federal Reserve last year, only a spelling error stopped them. They were digitally looting an account of the Bangladesh Central Bank, when bankers grew suspicious about a withdrawal request that had misspelled \u201cfoundation\u201d as \u201cfandation.\u201dEven so, Kim Jong-un\u2019s minions still got away with $81 million in that heist.Their track record is mixed, but North Korea\u2019s army of more than 6,000 hackers is undeniably persistent, and undeniably improving, according to American and British security officials who have traced these attacks and others back to the North.Unlike its weapons tests, which have led to international sanctions, the North\u2019s cyberstrikes have faced almost no pushback or punishment, even as the regime is already using its hacking capabilities for actual attacks against its adversaries in the West.And just as Western analysts once scoffed at the potential of the North\u2019s nuclear program, so did experts dismiss its cyberpotential \u2014 only to now acknowledge that hacking is an almost perfect weapon for a Pyongyang that is isolated and has little to lose.\u201cCyber is a tailor-made instrument of power for them,\u201d said Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, who now teaches about security at the United States Naval Academy. \u201cThere\u2019s a low cost of entry, it\u2019s largely asymmetrical, there\u2019s some degree of anonymity and stealth in its use. It can hold large swaths of nation state infrastructure and private-sector infrastructure at risk. It\u2019s a source of income.\u201dMr. Inglis, speaking at the Cambridge Cyber Summit this month, added: \u201cYou could argue that they have one of the most successful cyberprograms on the planet, not because it\u2019s technically sophisticated, but because it has achieved all of their aims at very low cost.\u201dIt is hardly a one-way conflict: By some measures the United States and North Korea have been engaged in an active cyberconflict for years.Both the United States and South Korea have also placed digital \u201cimplants\u201d in the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North Korean equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents that Edward J. Snowden released several years ago. American-created cyber- and electronic warfare weapons were deployed to disable North Korean missiles, an attack that was, at best, only partially successful.Indeed, both sides see cyber as the way to gain tactical advantage in their nuclear and missile standoff.There is evidence Pyongyang has planted so-called digital sleeper cells in the South\u2019s critical infrastructure, and its Defense Ministry, that could be activated to paralyze power supplies and military command and control networks.What has not been disclosed, until now, is that North Korea had also hacked into a British television network a few weeks earlier to stop it from broadcasting a drama about a nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.Once North Korea counterfeited crude $100 bills to try to generate hard cash. Now intelligence officials estimate that North Korea reaps hundreds of millions of dollars a year from ransomware, digital bank heists, online video game cracking, and more recently, hacks of South Korean Bitcoin exchanges.One former British intelligence chief estimates the take from its cyberheists may bring the North as much as $1 billion a year, or a third of the value of the nation\u2019s exports.The North Korean cyberthreat \u201ccrept up on us,\u201d said Robert Hannigan, the former director of Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, which handles electronic surveillance and cybersecurity.\u201cBecause they are such a mix of the weird and absurd and medieval and highly sophisticated, people didn\u2019t take it seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can such an isolated, backward country have this capability? Well, how can such an isolated backward country have this nuclear ability?\u201dKim Jong-il, the father of the current dictator and the initiator of North Korea\u2019s cyberoperations, was a movie lover who became an internet enthusiast, a luxury reserved for the country\u2019s elite. When Mr. Kim died in 2011, the country was estimated to have 1,024 IP addresses, fewer than on most New York City blocks.Mr. Kim, like the Chinese, initially saw the internet as a threat to his regime\u2019s ironclad control over information. But his attitude began to change in the early 1990s, after a group of North Korean computer scientists returned from travel abroad proposing to use the web to spy on and attack enemies like the United States and South Korea, according to defectors.North Korea began identifying promising students at an early age for special training, sending many to China\u2019s top computer science programs. In the late 1990s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s counterintelligence division noticed that North Koreans assigned to work at the United Nations were also quietly enrolling in university computer programming courses in New York.\u201cThe F.B.I. called me and said, \u2018What should we do?\u2019 \u201d recalled James A. Lewis, at the time in charge of cybersecurity at the Commerce Department. \u201cI told them, \u2018Don\u2019t do anything. Follow them and see what they are up to.\u2019\u201dThe North\u2019s cyberwarfare unit gained priority after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. After watching the American \u201cshock and awe\u201d campaign on CNN, Kim Jong-il issued a warning to his military: \u201cIf warfare was about bullets and oil until now,\u201d he told top commanders, according to a prominent defector, Kim Heung-kwang, \u201cwarfare in the 21st century is about information.\u201dThe unit was marked initially by mishaps and bluster.\u201cThere was an enormous growth in capability from 2009 or so, when they were a joke,\u201d said Ben Buchanan, the author of \u201cThe Cybersecurity Dilemma\u201d and a fellow at the Cyber Security Project at Harvard. \u201cThey would execute a very basic attack against a minor web page put up by the White House or an American intelligence agency, and then their sympathizers would claim they\u2019d hacked the U.S. government. But since then, their hackers have gotten a lot better.\u201dA National Intelligence Estimate in 2009 wrote off the North\u2019s hacking prowess, much as it underestimated its long-range missile program. It would be years before it could mount a meaningful threat, it claimed.But the regime was building that threat.When Kim Jong-un succeeded his father, in 2011, he expanded the cybermission beyond serving as just a weapon of war, focusing also on theft, harassment and political-score settling.\u201cCyberwarfare, along with nuclear weapons and missiles, is an \u2018all-purpose sword\u2019 that guarantees our military\u2019s capability to strike relentlessly,\u201d Kim Jong-un reportedly declared, according to the testimony of a South Korean intelligence chief.And the array of United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang only incentivized Mr. Kim\u2019s embrace.\u201cWe\u2019re already sanctioning anything and everything we can,\u201d said Robert P. Silvers, the former assistant secretary for cyberpolicy at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. \u201cThey\u2019re already the most isolated nation in the world.\u201dBy 2012, government officials and private researchers say North Korea had dispersed its hacking teams abroad, relying principally on China\u2019s internet infrastructure. This allowed the North to exploit largely nonsecure internet connections and maintain a degree of plausible deniability.A recent analysis by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future found heavy North Korean internet activity in India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nepal, Kenya, Mozambique, and Indonesia. In some cases, like that of New Zealand, North Korean hackers were simply routing their attacks through the country\u2019s computers from abroad. In others, researchers believe they are now physically stationed in countries like India, where nearly one-fifth of Pyongyang\u2019s cyberattacks now originate.Intelligence agencies are now trying to track the North Korean hackers in these countries the way they have previously tracked terrorist sleeper cells or nuclear proliferators: looking for their favorite hotels, lurking in online forums they may inhabit, attempting to feed them bad computer code and counterattacking their own servers.For decades Iran and North Korea have shared missile technology, and American intelligence agencies have long sought evidence of secret cooperation in the nuclear arena. In cyber, the Iranians taught the North Koreans something important: When confronting an enemy that has internet-connected banks, trading systems, oil and water pipelines, dams, hospitals, and entire cities, the opportunities to wreak havoc are endless.By midsummer 2012, Iran\u2019s hackers, still recovering from an American and Israeli-led cyberattack on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment operations, found an easy target in Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company and the world\u2019s most valuable company.That August, Iranian hackers flipped a kill switch at precisely 11:08 a.m., unleashing a simple wiper virus onto 30,000 Aramco computers and 10,000 servers that would destroy data, and replace it with a partial image of a burning American flag. The damage was tremendous.Seven months later, during joint military exercises between American and South Korean forces, North Korean hackers, operating from computers inside China, deployed a very similar cyberweapon against computer networks at three major South Korean banks and South Korea\u2019s two largest broadcasters. Like Iran\u2019s Aramco attacks, the North Korean attacks on South Korean targets used wiping malware to eradicate data and paralyze their business operations.It may have been a copycat operation, but Mr. Hannigan, the former British official, said recently: \u201cWe have to assume they are getting help from the Iranians.\u201dAnd inside the National Security Agency, just a few years after analysts had written off Pyongyang as a low grade threat, there was suddenly a new appreciation that the country was figuring out cyber just as it had figured out nuclear weapons: test by test.\u201cNorth Korea showed that to achieve its political objectives, it will take down any company \u2014 period,\u201d Mr. Silvers said.A chief political objective of the cyberprogram is to preserve the image of the North\u2019s 33-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un. In August 2014, North Korean hackers went after a British broadcaster, Channel Four, which had announced plans for a television series about a British nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.First, the North Koreans protested to the British government. \u201cA scandalous farce,\u201d North Korea called the series. When that was ignored, British authorities found that the North had hacked into the television network\u2019s computer system. The attack was stopped before inflicting any damage, and David Abraham, the chief executive of Channel Four, initially vowed to continue the production.That attack, however, was just a prelude. When Sony Pictures Entertainment released a trailer for \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a comedy about two journalists dispatched to Pyongyang to assassinate North Korea\u2019s young new dictator, Pyongyang wrote a letter of complaint to the secretary general of the United Nations to stop the production. Then came threats to Sony.Michael Lynton, then Sony\u2019s chief executive, said when Sony officials called the State Department, they were told it was just more \u201cbluster,\u201d he said.\u201cAt that point in time, Kim Jong-un was relatively new in the job, and I don\u2019t think it was clear yet how he was different from his father,\u201d Mr. Lynton said in an interview. \u201cNobody ever mentioned anything about their cyber capabilities.\u201dIn September 2014, while still attempting to crack Channel 4, North Korean hackers buried deep into Sony\u2019s networks, lurking patiently for the next three months, as both Sony and American intelligence completely missed their presence.The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, was even in Pyongyang at the time, trying to win the release of a detained American, and had dinner with the then-chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau.On Nov. 24, the attack on Sony began: Employees arriving at work that day found their computer screens taken over by a picture of a red skeleton with a message signed \u201cGOP,\u201d for \u201cGuardians of Peace.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secrets,\u201d the message said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t obey us, we\u2019ll release data shown below to the world.\u201dThat was actually a diversion: The code destroyed 70 percent of Sony Pictures\u2019 laptops and computers. Sony employees were reduced to communicating via pen, paper and phone.Mr. Lynton said the F.B.I. told him that nothing could have been done to prevent the attack, since it was waged by a sovereign state. \u201cWe learned that you really have no way of protecting yourself in any meaningful way,\u201d he said of such nation-state attacks.Sony struggled to distribute the film as theaters were intimidated. (Ultimately it was distributed for download, and may have done better than it would have.) In London, outside investors in Channel Four\u2019s North Korea project suddenly dried up, and the project effectively died.The Obama White House responded to the Sony hack with sanctions that the North barely noticed, but with no other retaliation. \u201cA cyberbattle would be a lot more risky for the United States and its allies than for North Korea,\u201d said Mr. Silvers.Beyond respect, and retribution, the North wanted hard currency from its cyberprogram.So soon the digital bank heists began \u2014 an attack in the Philippines in October 2015; then the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam at the end of the same year; and then the Bangladesh Central Bank. Researchers at Symantec said it was the first time a state had used a cyberattack not for espionage or war, but to finance the country\u2019s operations.Now, the attacks are increasingly cunning. Security experts noticed in February that the website of Poland\u2019s financial regulator was unintentionally infecting visitors with malware.It turned out that visitors to the Polish regulator\u2019s website \u2014 employees from Polish banks, from the central banks of Brazil, Chile, Estonia, Mexico, Venezuela, and even from prominent Western banks like Bank of America \u2014 had been targeted with a so-called watering hole attack, in which North Korean hackers waited for their victims to visit the site, then installed malware in their machines. Forensics showed that the hackers had put together a list of internet addresses from 103 organizations, most of them banks, and designed their malware to specifically infect visitors from those banks, in what researchers said appeared to be an effort to move around stolen currency.More recently, North Koreans seemed to have changed tack once again. North Korean hackers\u2019 fingerprints showed up in a series of attempted attacks on so-called cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, and were successful in at least one case, according to researchers at FireEye.The attacks on Bitcoin exchanges, which see hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin exchanged a day, offered Pyongyang a potentially very lucrative source of new funds. And, researchers say, there is evidence they have been exchanging Bitcoin gathered from their heists for Monero, a highly anonymous version of cryptocurrency that is far harder for global authorities to trace.The most widespread hack was WannaCry, a global ransomware attack that used a program that cripples a computer and demands a ransom payment in exchange for unlocking the computer, or its data. In a twist the North Koreans surely enjoyed, their hackers based the attack on a secret tool, called \u201cEternal Blue,\u201d stolen from the National Security Agency.In the late afternoon of May 12, panicked phone calls flooded in from around Britain and the world. The computer systems of several major British hospital systems were shut down, forcing diversions of ambulances and the deferral of nonemergency surgeries. Banks and transportation systems across dozens of countries were affected.Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Center had picked up no warning of the attack, said Paul Chichester, its director of operations. Investigators now think the WannaCry attack may have been an early misfire of a weapon that was still under development \u2014 or a test of tactics and vulnerabilities.\u201cThis was part of an evolving effort to find ways to disable key industries,\u201d said Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyber operations at the Government Communications Headquarters in Britain. \u201cAll I have to do is create a moderately disabling attack on a key part of the social infrastructure, and then watch the media sensationalize it and panic the public.\u201dIt ended thanks to Marcus Hutchins, a college dropout and self-taught hacker living with his parents in the southwest of England. He spotted a web address somewhere in the software and, on a lark, paid $10.69 to register it as a domain name. The activation of the domain name turned out to act as a kill switch causing the malware to stop spreading.British officials privately acknowledge that they know North Korea perpetrated the attack, but the government has taken no retaliatory action, uncertain what they can do.While American and South Korean officials often express outrage about North Korea\u2019s cyberactivities, they rarely talk about their own \u2014 and whether that helps fuel the cyber arms race.Yet both Seoul and Washington target the North\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, its nuclear program and its missile program. Hundreds, if not thousands, of American cyberwarriors spend each day mapping the North\u2019s few networks, looking for vulnerabilities that could be activated in time of crisis.At a recent meeting of American strategists to evaluate North Korea\u2019s capabilities, some participants expressed concerns that the escalating cyberwar could actually tempt the North to use its weapons \u2014 both nuclear and cyber \u2014 very quickly in any conflict, for fear that the United States has secret ways to shut the country down.The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, said last week that the United States is trying to compile a better picture of the leadership around Kim Jong-un, for a report to President Trump. Figuring out who oversees cyber and special operations is a central mystery. The Japanese press recently speculated it could be an official named Jang Kil-su. Others are curious about Gen. No Kwang-chol, who was elevated to the Central Committee of the North\u2019s ruling party in May 2016, and is one of the only members whose portfolio is undisclosed.The big question is whether Mr. Kim, fearful that his nuclear program is becoming too large and obvious a target, is focusing instead on how to shut down the United States without ever lighting off a missile. \u201cEveryone is focused on mushroom clouds,\u201d Mr. Silvers said, \u201cbut there is far more potential for another kind of disastrous escalation.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The \u2018Resistance,\u2019 Raising Big Money, Upends Liberal Politics", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It started as a scrappy grass-roots protest movement against President Trump, but now the so-called resistance is attracting six- and seven-figure checks from major liberal donors, posing an insurgent challenge to some of the left\u2019s most venerable institutions \u2014 and the Democratic Party itself.The jockeying between groups, donors and operatives for cash and turf is occurring mostly behind the scenes. But it has grown acrimonious at times, with upstarts complaining they are being boxed out by a liberal establishment that they say enables the sort of Democratic timidity that paved the way for the Trump presidency.Entrenched Democratic groups are facing growing questions about the return on the hundreds of millions of dollars they have spent over the years. Groups affiliated with Mrs. Clinton \u201cspent so much money based on a bad strategy in this last cycle that they should step aside and let others lead in this moment,\u201d said Quentin James, a founder of a political committee called the Collective PAC that supports African-American candidates.While the new groups gained early traction mostly on the strength of grass-roots volunteers and small donations \u2014 and with relatively meager overall budgets \u2014 they are beginning to attract attention from the left\u2019s most generous benefactors.\u201cWe\u2019re in a disruptive period, and when we get through it, the progressive infrastructure landscape may look different,\u201d said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. \u201cThere may be groups that have been around that don\u2019t rise to the challenge, and there may be some new groups that do rise to the challenge, while others fade away.\u201dBut this year, the Democracy Alliance hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama White House official, to help the new anti-Trump groups, and it suspended its intensive vetting and approval process to recommend donations to a host of groups created since last fall\u2019s election.Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible. Started as a Google document detailing techniques for opposing the Republican agenda under Mr. Trump, the group now has a mostly Washington-based staff of about 40 people, with more than 6,000 volunteer chapters across the country. The national Indivisible hub, which consists of a pair of nonprofit groups, has raised nearly $6 million since its start, primarily through small-dollar donations made through its website.Indivisible would \u201cgladly\u201d accept a check from Mr. Soros or his foundation, said an official with the group, Sarah Dohl. But, she added, the group is committed to ensuring that money from major donors does not become a majority of the group\u2019s revenue \u201cbecause we want to maintain our independence both from the funders and from the party.\u201dThe group may start a political committee that could support primary challenges in 2018 against Democratic incumbents, Ms. Dohl said.The Democracy Alliance's 'resistance map' includes a mix of new and older groups to which the club is recommending its members donate to oppose the Trump administration.Established liberal groups like the Center for American Progress haven\u2019t always been as forceful, Ms. Dohl said, though she added that the think tank \u201chas gotten better at calling on Democrats to stand up and speak more boldly than they have in the past.\u201dDaniella Leger, a CAP official, explained in a statement that the group\u2019s legal team was merely exploring \u201ca standard question\u201d about whether to trademark the logo. \u201cThe immediate response was no \u2014 resistance belongs to everyone,\u201d she said.But the embrace by CAP has some anti-Trump activists complaining privately that the group is anathema to the anti-establishment fervor animating the resistance, and it is siphoning away resources from the new groups.The divisions have sometimes spilled into public view.Matt Bennett, an official at Third Way, challenged predictions that the new wave of resistance activism would substantially shift the axis of the party. \u201cThe idea that all the energy in the Democratic Party is on the far left is premature, and is going to turn out to be the worst prediction of the 2020 cycle,\u201d he said.Mr. Brock and Ms. Leger both said that their groups have been providing research, polling, training and other resources to the new groups, which they cast as a boon to the left, rather than a threat to more established groups.\u201cThe resistance is strongest when everyone has access to our resources,\u201d Mr. Brock said. Ms. Leger said, \u201cThese grass-roots groups play a different, unique role, and their energy is something the progressive movement hadn\u2019t seen in decades.\u201d And a D.N.C. spokeswoman, Xochitl Hinojosa, praised the new groups for their work to \u201cbring about progressive change and elect Democrats.\u201dYet one major Democratic donor, the Virginia real estate developer Albert J. Dwoskin, said the fluidity in the universe of liberal groups would cause some donors to sit on the sidelines \u201cto wait to see which ones have any legs whatsoever.\u201d And veteran Democratic operatives are concerned that the proliferation could further fracture the left, widening ideological divisions and leaving groups fighting for resources.\u201cThe Democratic Party has been fractured,\u201d Mr. Mehlhorn said. \u201cWe believe that by investing in different people and groups to try different techniques that good ideas will emerge.\u201dA Silicon Valley-like competition between start-ups might not be the best thing for the left right now, warned Rob Stein, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped create the Democracy Alliance to provide structure to the institutional left.\u201cHaving a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve got your back against the wall, too many new blooms can cause message and operational cacophony.\u201dHe warned that the combination of ideological and structural divisions, along with a national party weakened by changes in campaign finance laws, could \u201cmake it very, very difficult for progressives and Democrats to drive a coherent message in 2018, and to align behind a single candidate in 2020.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Male Infertility Crisis Is Coming. The Middle East Can Help.", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWestern men\u2019s sperm counts are falling, and we ought to be concerned.A major study published this July in the highly regarded fertility journal Human Reproduction Update showed that across Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, men\u2019s sperm counts declined by 50 to 60 percent over the 38-year period between 1973 and 2011. Environmental and lifestyle factors may be responsible for the decline. But the end result may be a new social crisis of male infertility \u2014 with potentially wrenching emotional implications for both the men and women involved.That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that other regions of the world have gone through this already. The Middle East has been grappling with serious male infertility problems for decades. It has lessons to offer the rest of the globe.Over the past 30 years, my research has focused on male infertility in the Middle East. There, genetic sperm defects \u2014 the main cause of male infertility \u2014 are particularly common and often run in families. High rates of male smoking, ambient air pollution in the major cities and the stresses of war, too, have taken a costly toll on male reproductive health. Yet the region not only has made tremendous technological advances in combating male infertility but also has undergone a dramatic change in societal attitudes toward the problem.Back in the 1980s, as a doctoral student, I headed to Egypt to study infertility. Semen analysis had become widely available there by the 1970s, and by the time I arrived, ordinary Egyptians \u2014 including many a male cabdriver I spoke with \u2014 were aware that men could have \u201cweak\u201d sperm. Scientific advances had made clear that infertility was not just a female burden.And yet this widespread public awareness did not, at the time, translate into openness. Cabdrivers might be willing to chat, but individual Egyptian men rarely disclosed their own infertility problems, even to close family members. Male infertility remained highly stigmatizing and emasculating; men often expected their wives to shoulder the blame for their childlessness in public. Infertility \u2014 caused by sperm defects \u2014 was often conflated with impotence.Since those early days, much has changed as a result of several factors. Medical progress, religious permissions and government efforts have combined to make male infertility treatment much more accessible. But men themselves have played a major role in lifting taboos, in ways that are instructive for the West.The changes began with Islamic clerics, who were among the world\u2019s first religious leaders to approve in vitro fertilization as a solution to marital infertility. A permissive fatwa covering IVF issued in Egypt in 1980 allowed the introduction of high-tech assisted reproduction across the Muslim world. The next decades saw an IVF boom, and today, the Middle East claims one of the strongest IVF sectors in the world.This emergence of high-tech reproductive medicine took a leap forward in the 1990s, with the introduction of a new and particularly effective form of IVF treatment known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI, pronounced \u201cik-see\u201d), a breakthrough that gives infertile men a real chance to become biological fathers. The coming of ICSI to the Middle East was a technological revolution that in turn led to a social revolution. As more and more infertile men sought the widely advertised \u201cICSI solution,\u201d male infertility was transformed from a masculinity problem into a medical condition.The widespread availability of ICSI has led to a \u201ccoming out\u201d of infertile men across the region. Governments have helped this process along by pushing to make fertility treatments more accessible through public financing. Today, Middle Eastern men are increasingly open about their fertility problems: They tell their families, share information with friends and colleagues, and swap clinical recommendations with others needing help.As men like Nabil have come to acknowledge their infertility problems and seek treatment, they have helped to lighten the heavy load once carried by their wives: the scrutiny from in-laws, the social ostracism, the threats of divorce or polygynous remarriage. Indeed, the introduction of high-tech male infertility treatment and Middle Eastern men\u2019s eager embrace of this technology have had positive effects on gender relations across the region.To be sure, there are very real and important differences between the Middle East and the West when it comes to male infertility. In the Middle East, most infertile couples are barred from using donor sperm to conceive, despite the religious permissibility of many other treatments and technologies such as ICSI. In the West, ICSI has long been widely available, but the cost sometimes makes it inaccessible, particularly in the United States. But the primary obstacle has come from men\u2019s own silence on the subject \u2014 and here is where the Middle East can serve as an instructive example.Studies in the West have shown that male infertility remains a hidden, highly stigmatized problem \u2014 laden with feelings of inadequacy, confused with impotence and often spoken of, derogatorily, as \u201cshooting blanks.\u201d If women in the West have made great progress in talking about their own fertility struggles, men\u2019s progress in this arena has been much slower going. In the West, the psychological stigma might not wind up as a barrier to seeking treatment \u2014 most couples who want a child are by now open to medical intervention if they can afford it. But it does mean that many men will experience unnecessary psychological pain and isolation.Although the Middle East is rarely held up as a model of progressive gender thinking, the region is a case study in the power of recasting infertility as a medical problem, not one of manhood. Technology can help, but in the end, there\u2019s a large role for men themselves to play in speaking up about male infertility, especially as sperm counts fall.Marcia C. Inhorn is a professor of anthropology and international affairs at Yale University, specializing in Middle Eastern gender, religious and health issues.Advertisement"}

He later went to Hollywood, where he financed hits like the \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise and \u201cAvatar.\u201dNow, unfortunately, both Cohn and Mnuchin are endangering their reputations in their attempts to sell a tax cut.I realize that the two men have already ruined their reputations with many of President Trump\u2019s critics, simply by working for Trump. But those opinions don\u2019t matter much to Cohn and Mnuchin. If they did, the two never would have joined the administration \u2014 Cohn as chief White House economic adviser, Mnuchin as Treasury secretary.Within the administration, there are real differences among how top officials have behaved and how they are perceived. Several \u2014 Tom Price, Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer and Rex Tillerson \u2014 have badly sullied their standing with virtually everyone outside the administration. After long careers, they have turned themselves into punch lines.Cohn and Mnuchin have started to risk theirs. This column is a plea to them: Please stop, for everyone\u2019s sake, including yours.There is no way to make up for tax cuts this large by eliminating deductions, as Mnuchin claimed. The administration isn\u2019t trying very hard, anyway. The deductions for charitable donations and mortgage interest, including on second homes, will remain.It is not too late for Cohn and Mnuchin to take a different approach. Doing so still won\u2019t win over many people to their tax plan (including me). But they can make a free-market case for lower taxes that is based on something other than lies.Neither one of them has yet turned 60 years old. These won\u2019t be their last jobs. In the daily scrum, I\u2019m sure that pleasing their boss must seem like the most important possible thing. But their reputation and their personal code of ethics deserve some consideration too. The Jim Mattis route is a lot better than the punch line route.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Unlikely to Name Top Two Fed Officials at Same Time, Mnuchin Says", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 President Trump, who has several spots to fill at the Federal Reserve, is expected to nominate its next chairman this coming week but is unlikely to simultaneously tap a vice chairman at the same time, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday, eliminating one potential twist in a selection process being closely watched on Wall Street.Speaking to reporters aboard a military aircraft during a weeklong Middle East trip, Mr. Mnuchin did not drop any hints as to who Mr. Trump might pick but said that he had been discussing the Fed decision with Mr. Trump while he was traveling and that the focus was on naming the next chairman.\u201cI think for the moment we\u2019re focused on the Fed chair decision. That\u2019s really the focus at the moment,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. He added that market reaction to the pick was not a \u201cprimary consideration\u201d in whom Mr. Trump plans to choose to lead the Fed.Mr. Trump has turned the Fed pick into a very public display and has on several occasions named those he is considering. The roster appears to have narrowed to Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor who has voted in favor of every Fed policy decision since 2012 and John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist who has been critical of the central bank. However, Mr. Trump has also said he remains a fan of the Fed\u2019s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, whose term expires next year.While he would not comment on any of the candidates on Mr. Trump\u2019s shortlist, Mr. Mnuchin said he did have a positive rapport with Ms. Yellen.\u201cI do have a good relationship with Yellen,\u201d said Mr. Mnuchin, who was careful not to tip his hand. \u201cI expect whoever is appointed by the president as Fed chair, I would expect to have a very good relationship with.\u201dMr. Mnuchin is in the midst of a four-country swing to discuss efforts to combat terrorist financing. He held meetings with business leaders and government officials in Saudi Arabia and Israel and on Saturday was en route to the United Arab Emirates, which he will visit before finishing his trip in Qatar on Monday.The possibility of more sanctions on Iran has been an important topic of discussion with his counterparts in the Middle East, said Mr. Mnuchin, who criticized the Iranians for violating various United Nations resolutions and creating problems in the region. Earlier this week, Mr. Mnuchin commemorated the establishment of a new center in Saudi Arabia targeting terrorist financing that is a collaborative effort between the United States and several Gulf nations.The Treasury\u2019s lack of action on new Russia sanctions mandated by Congress has irked some Senate Republicans. Mr. Mnuchin said in the interview that he had been in touch this past week with Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, to discuss the status of those sanctions. The Trump administration missed a deadline imposed by Congress to start the process, but Mr. Mnuchin denied that the administration was dragging its feet.\u201cWe expect that to come out in the near future,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of specific details to go through, but there\u2019s no specific delay per say.\u201dThe Middle East trip comes at a hectic time for the Trump administration\u2019s domestic agenda. Not only is the Fed decision expected this coming week, but Republicans in the House of Representatives are due to release tax legislation on Wednesday.Mr. Mnuchin said he had been having daily telephone calls with his Treasury colleagues and with lawmakers in the House and Senate as they put the finishing touches on a tax bill. Despite the fact that they have been working on a plan since January, Mr. Mnuchin said there were still \u201cactive discussions\u201d taking place over various provisions. Those include finding a way to prevent a new 25 percent tax rate for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses from becoming a loophole that would allow wealthy individuals to lower their tax bills. And he said it was too soon to say if Republicans would fully repeal the state and local tax deduction, which allows homeowners to deduct property and state and local income taxes from their federal tax bill.\u201cWe\u2019ve been having a lot of discussions on the SALT issue,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, using the acronym for the deduction, \u201cand what the impact of that is in several states that are a big part of the economy.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said on Saturday that he remained optimistic that the tax cuts could be passed and signed by the president by December.\u201cIf we could do it quicker, that would be great,\u201d he said.Mr. Mnuchin also said it was difficult to define which American families should be defined as middle class or rich \u2014 a key question lawmakers face as they set income levels for new tax brackets. He said that relative wealth varies with states\u2019 and cities\u2019 cost of living but that his priority is for people around the national median income level to get tax cuts.In Saudi Arabia and Israel, where Mr. Trump is popular, Mr. Mnuchin drew a warm welcome.Mr. Mnuchin, his wife, Louise Linton, and a Treasury delegation toured the Old City of Jerusalem for more than an hour on Friday. Several onlookers who recognized him approached to shake hands, offer praise and pose for photographs.Surrounded by a phalanx of Secret Service agents, Mr. Mnuchin and his group meandered though the stone pathways of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish quarters. They also visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the Western Wall, where Mr. Mnuchin prayed and inscribed the guest book at one of the most holy sites in Judaism.After his prayer, Mr. Mnuchin expressed hope for strength, peace and prosperity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Strong Nominee. A Divisive Opponent. But Can Democrats Win in Alabama?", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut now Democrats are grappling with an all-too-familiar question of their own: how and even whether to confront a Republican Senate candidate whose views they find repugnant but who may be unbeatable in a deeply conservative state \u2014 no matter how much money liberal donors pour in to defeat him.Democrats here and in Washington believe that their nominee, Doug Jones, is the most formidable candidate they have fielded for the Senate in this state in over two decades. A former United States attorney who prosecuted the men who perpetrated the civil rights-era bombing of this city\u2019s 16th Street Baptist Church, Mr. Jones, 63, is that rare Southern politician who possesses law-and-order credentials and is esteemed in the black community.Yet well before Alabama voters go to the polls on Dec. 12, Democrats face a critical decision at a moment when all politics is national. Some in the party believe that they simply cannot write off the South if they expect to regain control of Congress \u2014 and that they will never recover here if they abandon high-quality candidates such as Mr. Jones.But the Democratic brand has become so toxic in states such as Alabama that if the national party rallies behind Mr. Jones and turns his candidacy into a liberal cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, it could only doom him by pushing Republicans reluctant to support Mr. Moore back to their partisan corner.\u201cIt\u2019s a very tricky pass for national Democrats,\u201d said David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist and former adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cJones is a very, very good candidate, but Alabama is a very, very tough state, maybe the toughest state. And you want to avoid the trap that you fell into in Georgia by building expectations for a race that\u2019s going to be difficult to win.\u201dSenator Tim Kaine of Virginia said it was even more profound. Mr. Kaine does not speak up often at the weekly lunches of Democratic senators, but he did two weeks ago because he wanted to tell his colleagues about Mr. Jones, whom he has grown close with over their shared passion for racial reconciliation. This race, Mr. Kaine said in an interview, requires Democrats to respond to their conscience.\u201cWhen you have a person who speaks to a very unique need for healing in the country right now and is facing off against a guy who will not heal our divisions but will fan them, it\u2019s a good race to be helpful in,\u201d he said, noting he had already given Mr. Jones the maximum legal amount.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, is engaged in the race and held calls on Tuesday and Wednesday with Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who runs the Democratic Senate campaign arm, and top aides about Mr. Jones, according to two party officials briefed on the conversations. And Mr. Van Hollen used a Senate Democratic luncheon to urge his colleagues to contribute to Mr. Jones\u2019s campaign and promote him on social media.Henry R. Mu\u00f1oz III, the finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the party\u2019s top fund-raisers conferred about the race at a meeting in Washington last week, reviewing it along with long-anticipated contests for governor in New Jersey and Virginia. Mr. Mu\u00f1oz said they would convene a session with major donors to discuss the Alabama race.\u201cPeople said: O.K., maybe at first blush, you wouldn\u2019t look at Alabama as a place we can win,\u201d Mr. Mu\u00f1oz said of the meeting last week. \u201cBut maybe we can, and it\u2019s important that we take a stand.\u201dMr. Mu\u00f1oz, who is gay, said Mr. Moore was a uniquely offensive candidate and predicted that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender donors, among others, would mobilize to stop him. \u201cThe phones are burning up,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things that the L.G.B.T. community is good at is organizing itself and organizing itself financially.\u201dStill, Mr. Jones is in a Goldilocks-like position of seeking just enough national attention to raise money for television ads, but not so much that it defines his campaign. He has raised over $820,000 from all 50 states since Mr. Moore\u2019s win on Tuesday, according to his campaign.Officials from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee are already in Alabama, and the D.N.C. is holding weekly meetings dedicated to the race here. Two of the party\u2019s leading pollsters are expected to take surveys here this week.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is coming here to stump for Mr. Jones on Tuesday. James Carville, the longtime Bill Clinton strategist, has talked to the former president about the race. And African-American leaders are eager to help.At his first event of the general election, at Niki\u2019s West, a Birmingham restaurant, campaign aides passed out fliers to a multiracial crowd showing Mr. Jones speaking with voters outside the 16th Street Baptist Church, alongside a list of policy commitments like fighting voting restrictions \u201cas harmful as Jim Crow laws.\u201dFacing a battery of cameras in a sun-baked parking lot, Mr. Jones came out swinging against Mr. Moore, describing him as a divisive figure with a \u201cpersonal agenda\u201d and contempt for the \u201crule of law.\u201dYet Mr. Jones\u2019s campaign brochure also illustrated why he faces an uphill campaign: Listed above his opposition to \u201cvoter suppression\u201d was a vow to \u201cdefend a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d It is exceedingly difficult for Democrats to win in the Deep South while pledging vocal support for abortion rights.Representative Terri A. Sewell, who is Alabama\u2019s lone Democrat in Congress and holds a majority-black seat reaching from Birmingham through the most heavily African-American rural counties, predicted that her district would be motivated to turn out for Mr. Jones.\u201cI do believe that Roy Moore harkens us back to the days of a George Wallace,\u201d Ms. Sewell said, invoking the state\u2019s segregationist former governor. She predicted the race would draw prominent figures to Alabama: \u201cI would not be surprised if you saw the likes of John Lewis and Clinton and others.\u201dMs. Sewell squired Mr. Jones around a Congressional Black Caucus retreat last weekend in Washington, introducing him to leading party officials.Mr. Jones was more ambivalent about national Democrats joining him in Alabama, aside from Mr. Biden, whom he described as a friend. He was noncommittal when asked if he would welcome former President Barack Obama on the trail.This is one of the South\u2019s most Republican states. It lacks a large liberal city such as Atlanta and has a smaller proportion of African-Americans than Mississippi or Louisiana. Republicans control every statewide office, and a Democrat has not won a United States Senate race for a quarter-century. Even with energized black voters, who make up 27 percent of the state\u2019s population, Mr. Obama fell short of 40 percent both times he ran.Matt McDonald, a Mobile-based lawyer, is one of those Republican-leaning voters who supports Mr. Jones.

Over all, the boys seem to have more chances to do things (with badges in activities like whitewater rafting, welding and bugling). The girls have more badges for caring for others (being a good neighbor, a voice for animals, a social butterfly).Some Girl Scout badges promote stereotypical notions of femininity.

He coordinated straw donations to circumvent campaign finance caps. He asked the police to shut down one lane of the Lincoln Tunnel to clear the way for his boss\u2019s car, because, he recalled, that was going to earn him \u201ca lot of points.\u201dIn a flat, matter-of-fact tone, Jona S. Rechnitz, a wealthy real estate developer, laid out in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Thursday his account of how he paid his way into the city\u2019s political and law enforcement circles, in exchange for favors for himself, his friends and his business interests.Prosecutors announced in March that they would not bring charges against Mr. de Blasio. The officers\u2019 trial is pending.On Thursday, Mr. Rechnitz, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, described a direct line to City Hall that he said was made possible primarily by his relationship with Ross Offinger, a fund-raiser for Mr. de Blasio whom he met during the mayor\u2019s campaign.\u201cHe would call whenever they needed money, or I would call whenever we had an issue,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said of Mr. Offinger. \u201cI was the yes man. I always gave money, as long as I was seeing him produce results.\u201dMr. Rechnitz said he and his friend, Jeremy Reichberg, raised $100,000 for Mr. de Blasio, with Mr. Rechnitz and his wife each donating $4,950 directly to the mayor\u2019s campaign.Campaign finance records show that Mr. Rechnitz bundled $41,000 for the mayor in his 2013 campaign.Mr. Rechnitz said Mr. de Blasio visited him at his office soon after Mr. Rechnitz met with Mr. Offinger. Mr. de Blasio gave him his personal email address and his cellphone number, written on the back of a business card.\u201cHe told me to call if there was anything I need, always be in touch,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said, \u201cand he really appreciated my support and friendship.\u201dMr. Rechnitz was in touch \u2014 at least once a week, he said, on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s cellphone. They talked about \u201cdifferent issues in the city, if he wins, who he should be appointing for certain positions.\u201d\u201cJust talking and getting to know one another,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said. He added: \u201cHe took my calls. We were friends.\u201dMr. de Blasio has cast their relationship in starkly different terms. In August, when asked about email exchanges with Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg, the mayor told reporters that he \u201cnever knew them well.\u201d\u201cThese were part of a slew of people who suddenly wanted to be connected to our world when I won the election. Didn\u2019t know them,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cThey sent emails and what typically happened was they didn\u2019t get what they wanted.\u201dThe issues on which Mr. Rechnitz said he called in favors, usually through Mr. Offinger, ranged from the ceremonial \u2014 securing a spot on the mayor\u2019s inauguration committee \u2014 to the financial \u2014 disputing thousands of dollars in fines for an Airbnb listing at one of his properties \u2014 to the mundane: helping a friend resolve a water billing issue.\u201cWhenever we would call him for access or for a favor, we were getting the response that we expected and the results we were expecting,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said of Mr. Offinger.The mayor\u2019s press secretary, Eric F. Phillips, in a statement on Thursday afternoon, called the testimony \u201cnothing but reheated, repackaged accusations that have been extensively reviewed and passed on by authorities at multiple levels.\u201d\u201cThe administration has never and will never make government decisions based on campaign contributions,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.Harlan Levy, Mr. Offinger\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Offinger is a highly respected fund-raiser and that he \u201cacted legally and appropriately at all times.\u201dAt times, Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony sounded like a who\u2019s who of city and state power players.He courted high-ranking police officers. Philip Banks III, who was a top chief in the New York Police Department, sometimes chauffeured Mr. Rechnitz in his police vehicle. When the chairman of Africa Israel, the company where Mr. Rechnitz was employed before founding his own firm, visited from Israel, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg arranged for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to close one lane of the Lincoln Tunnel so that the chairman\u2019s entourage could pass through unimpeded.Several times, Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony elicited what sounded like muffled laughs of disbelief from the audience.

{"Headline": "Ongoing Trump Migraine: His Initial Foreign Policy Team", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 One lasted only 24 days as President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, done in by his lack of candor about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador. Another has been hauled in front of a federal grand jury investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the election.A third has pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents about his own contacts with Russians.Such is the fate of some of the earliest foreign policy advisers that Donald J. Trump announced with great fanfare in early 2016, a time when he was closing in on the Republican presidential nomination. It was a team born out of a political problem: Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise march to the nomination had left the party\u2019s establishment openly questioning whether he had the foreign policy experience and was too much of a loose cannon to be entrusted with the presidency.Mr. Trump\u2019s solution was to cobble together a list of men who were almost immediately written off as a collection of fringe thinkers and has-beens and unknowns in Washington foreign policy circles. Some from that group have now created far deeper problems for Mr. Trump, providing federal and congressional investigators with evidence of suspicious interactions with Russian officials and their emissaries.Court documents and interviews with some of the advisers themselves revealed that many on the team embraced a common view: that the United States ought to seek a rapprochement with Russia after years of worsening relations during the Obama administration. Now, however, their suspected links to Russia have put them under legal scrutiny and cast a shadow over the Trump presidency.The fact that so many of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy aides from that period have now acknowledged contacts with Russian officials or their intermediaries hints at Moscow\u2019s eagerness to establish links to his campaign.Mr. Papadopoulos, then 28, had some minor campaign experience. After he promised to raise substantial sums from the Greek-American community, Ben Carson\u2019s campaign hired him for $5,000 a month to serve on its national security and foreign policy advisory committee.After Mr. Carson\u2019s campaign collapsed, Mr. Papadopoulos moved into Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. According to interviews and the court papers released Monday, he discussed the campaign\u2019s priorities with Sam Clovis, then a top policy adviser and campaign supervisor, and \u201cunderstood that a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.\u201dIn a statement from his lawyer, Victoria Toensing, Mr. Clovis denied that. \u201cThat was not Dr. Clovis\u2019s view,\u201d it said.In late March last year, Mr. Papadopoulos emailed Mr. Clovis and others that he had discussed with his contacts \u2014 a London-based professor with Moscow ties and a Russian woman whom he described as a relative of Mr. Putin\u2019s \u2014 the possibility of a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s leadership.\u201cGreat work,\u201d Mr. Clovis responded, according to the court documents and interviews.At a March 31 meeting in a foreman\u2019s lounge at the Trump Hotel in Washington, which was under construction, with Mr. Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Mr. Clovis and others immediately expressed doubts about the wisdom of the idea, noting that Russia was under United States sanctions and denouncing the \u201coptics\u201d of a meeting with Mr. Putin, according to a former campaign aide who attended the meeting.But Mr. Trump listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t say yes, and he didn\u2019t say no,\u201d said the former aide, who agreed to describe the meeting on the condition of anonymity.Finally, Mr. Sessions, as the campaign\u2019s top national security official, spoke vehemently against the idea, asking others not to discuss it again. Mr. Trump did not challenge him, the former aide said.Nonetheless, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to pursue the notion of some sort of meeting for several months, updating Trump campaign officials on his efforts, the court records showed.He emailed one high-ranking campaign official saying that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had asked if the campaign would send a representative to Russia, and he offered to go. In August 2016, Mr. Clovis wrote Mr. Papadopoulos encouraging him and another adviser to make the trip, \u201cif it is feasible.\u201d It never took place.Ms. Toensing, Mr. Clovis\u2019s lawyer, said that Mr. Clovis agreed that Mr. Papadopoulos should travel as a private individual, not as a campaign aide.\u201cHe was hitting on everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they all ignore him and the trips didn\u2019t occur.\u201dFormer campaign officials say Mr. Papadopoulos peppered them with unwanted emails. After he criticized the British leadership on television, he wrote asking if he would be fired.Stephen K. Bannon, then the campaign chairman, did not bother to respond.Scott Shane, Glenn Thrush and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawsuit Claims Three U.S. Companies Funded Terror in Iraq", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A lawsuit filed in federal court on Tuesday contends that major American corporations doing business with the Iraqi government during the Iraq War also provided it with free drugs and medical devices that became an important source of funding for a Shiite militia that targeted United States troops.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of members of the American military who were injured or killed by attacks between 2005 and 2009, at the height of the Iraq War. It accuses five companies \u2014 American firms General Electric, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer and European drugmakers AstraZeneca and Roche Holding A.G. \u2014 of winning contracts to sell their products to the Iraqi Ministry of Health with the understanding that they also provide additional medical supplies and medicines for free.As evidence, the lawsuit cited contracts between the companies and the Iraqi government, leaked diplomatic cables, press accounts and the testimony of informants. It was filed in United States District Court in Washington by lawyers from of a start-up firm led by Ryan Sparacino, who has been investigating the allegations for more than a year, and the litigation firm of Kellogg Hansen.\u201cWhile Americans worked to rebuild Iraq, many were attacked by a terrorist group that we allege has been funded in part by the defendants\u2019 corrupt sales practices,\u201d said Josh Branson, a Kellogg Hansen partner.A spokeswoman for Pfizer, Allyanna Anglim, said the company \u201ccategorically denies any wrongdoing. Our mission is to provide medicines to patients to help better their lives.\u201dJohnson & Johnson declined to comment.Jennifer Friedman, a spokeswoman for General Electric, said the company \u201cbecame aware of the complaint today and we are thoroughly reviewing the allegations.\u201dThe lawsuit says that the companies underwrote the Mahdi Army in two ways. Contracts mandated discounts, but instead of lowering the price, the companies provided \u201cfree goods\u201d often equal to about 10 percent of the total order, allowing ministry officials to sell the extras on the black market or distribute them to fighters.The companies were also required to hire intermediaries to register their companies, get approval for the use of their products in Iraq and negotiate contracts. The lawsuit says the payments to intermediaries were thinly-disguised bribes.After the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the procurement budget for Iraq\u2019s health ministry soared to more than $1 billion in 2004 from about $16 million, in part because of an infusion of aid from the United States.As the United States devolved power back to Iraqis n 2004, some government ministries were taken over by political factions. The health ministry was among the first to go, with Mr. Sadr\u2019s movement taking charge. Very quickly, the ministry\u2019s technocratic leaders and many secular doctors were purged.Mr. Sadr\u2019s militia was sometimes referred to as the \u201cPill Army\u201d because its fighters were often paid with prescription medicines and used hospitals as staging areas and ambulances to launch attacks. The Iraqi health ministry\u2019s headquarters and hospitals were festooned at the time with pictures of Mr. Sadr alongside slogans declaring \u201cDeath to America.\u201dThat the companies knew their business practices were inappropriate and perhaps illegal, the lawsuit said, was suggested by settlements each reached on charges that they had used identical tactics and even some of the same intermediaries before the war as part of an oil-for-food program sponsored by the United Nations that was found to be riddled with fraud.General Electric, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer are likely to argue that they were simply selling to a government that the United States was spending billions of dollars to support, and that cutting off Iraq\u2019s health ministry from lifesaving products would have been counterproductive to American goals.About 100 former military personnel or their family members are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable to have U.S. companies give money to terrorists who then kill U.S. troops,\u201d said one of the plaintiffs, Ami Neiberger-Miller. Her brother, Specialist Chris Neiberger, a 22-year-old tank gunner, was killed in 2007 in Baghdad when his Humvee was blown up by a device that Ms. Neiberger-Miller later learned was linked to the Mahdi Army.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Gird for Worst as Congress Wrestles with Children\u2019s Insurance Program", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal officials on Monday approved a $3.6 million emergency infusion for Minnesota after the state\u2019s human services chief warned that pregnant women and some children were at imminent risk of losing health care coverage under the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.Utah, meantime, has formally requested authority to \u201celiminate eligibility and services under CHIP\u201d if the state does not have enough money to continue coverage.In statehouses around the country, officials are preparing for the worst as lawmakers in Washington struggle to find money for the popular Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which insures nearly nine million children but lost its spending authority on Sunday, with the start of the new fiscal year.Congress has known for two years that federal funds for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program were expiring this fall. But only on Wednesday are two congressional panels \u2014 the Senate Finance Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee \u2014 tentatively scheduled to vote on legislation that would provide money for the program for another five years.And the two chambers have not agreed on how to pay for the measures.\u201cWe know that there is a desire in Congress to provide the funds, but we have heard that same sentiment all through the spring and the summer,\u201d said Nathan Checketts, the deputy director of the Utah Health Department. \u201cCongress needs to get this done as soon as possible, so states do not have to begin notifying people that their coverage may end.\u201dThe Utah program covers 19,000 children.Most states still have unspent funds that will last several months. But some are drafting contingency plans in case Congress does what it has done so often: fails to reach an agreement. A federal panel that advises Congress on the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program says that more than half the states are expected to exhaust all their CHIP funds within six months.By the end of this year, Arizona, Minnesota and North Carolina are likely to run out of money for their programs, according to the panel, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission.By March 2018, it said, CHIP funds will be exhausted in 27 additional states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Another 19 states are expected to use up their money from April to June 2018, with one state exhausting its funds from July to September 2018.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, said Tuesday that Congress\u2019s failure to act jeopardized coverage for 330,000 children in the state.Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, said the need was \u201cnot dire or urgent.\u201d Republicans, he said, intend to provide the funds, so \u201cthe money that is necessary to keep this program going is not in jeopardy.\u201dBut Democrats accused Republicans of willful inattention.\u201cIf making sure that every child in America has access to health care, if that is not a priority, what is?\u201d asked Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cFamilies are waiting anxiously while their health security is hanging in the balance.\u201dAction in the Senate was delayed for several weeks as Republicans made repeated unsuccessful attempts, in July and September, to pass legislation that would have repealed much of the Affordable Care Act.CHIP is for children in families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford other coverage. Nearly 90 percent of children in the program had family incomes less than twice the poverty level (less than about $40,000 a year for a family of three).Even if congressional committees can agree, it is not clear how soon legislation will emerge from Congress. The Senate plans to be in recess next week, and the House is expected to be in recess in the following week.The Senate bill is a bipartisan measure, drafted by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. Mr. Hatch, now the chairman of the Finance Committee, helped create the child health program in 1997 and says he is eager to extend it.In the House, some Democrats have expressed concerns about the bill drafted by House Republicans because, they say, it would pay for continuation of the CHIP program by cutting other health spending. Some House Democrats have suggested offsets that would instead reduce payments to pharmaceutical companies.Under federal law, states receive annual allotments of federal CHIP funds. They have two years to spend their allotments, and unspent money is then available for redistribution to other states. The money sent to Minnesota this week came from that pool of unspent funds.The Senate and House bills would each provide a total of $118.5 billion over five years, but under arcane budget rules, Congress needs to offset less than 10 percent of that cost. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that if the program ended, some children would become uninsured, but the federal government would help provide coverage for others, through Medicaid or through private insurance subsidized under the Affordable Care Act.The federal government and the states have historically shared the cost of CHIP, with Washington paying approximately 70 percent of the cost in a typical state. The Affordable Care Act increased the federal share by 23 percentage points, with the result that the federal government has been paying the entire cost in 11 states.The Senate and House bills would continue the 23 percentage point bonus in 2018 and 2019, cut it in half in 2020 and eliminate it in 2021 and 2022.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Killer Whale Could Be After SeaWorld", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsKiller whales sometimes hunt seals with carefully orchestrated attacks to tip them off disintegrating ice floes. Merlin Entertainments, the British-listed theme park operator, may be planning something similar with SeaWorld by trying to dislodge its Busch Gardens division. Breaking up the operator famed for its orcas might create some value, but it still looks like a slippery target.Both Merlin and SeaWorld were previously owned by Blackstone and listed in 2013. The private-equity firm, run by Stephen Schwarzman, sold its last stake in Merlin in 2015 and offloaded its SeaWorld holding to the Chinese group Zhonghong Zhuoye in March. Neither company has escaped controversy since going public, with Merlin marred by a roller-coaster crash at its Alton Towers theme park in England and SeaWorld\u2019s valuation yet to recover from the \u201cBlackfish\u201d documentary, which showed poor treatment of killer whales.A bid makes sense for Merlin. It wants to diversify away from its home market in Britain, which still generates 30 percent of its profit. The company\u2019s finance chief already identified SeaWorld\u2019s two Busch Gardens parks as potential acquisitions. An all-cash deal might push its debt to four times Ebitda, Stifel analysts reckon, perhaps requiring some equity, too. But investors like the idea: Merlin\u2019s share price rose over 3 percent on news of an approach.There might even be some financial benefits for SeaWorld. Say the parks could be offloaded at a conservative 11 times Ebitda multiple, a slight premium to the group\u2019s current valuation. A sale could fetch $1.6 billion based on estimated Ebitda of $145 million for the parks this year, adding around 10 percent to its market capitalization.Yet SeaWorld\u2019s shareholders seem glum, sending its shares down 2 percent. That may be because they were hoping for a full takeout. Merlin, after all, has sea-life parks, too. But its policy of not keeping large mammals such as killer whales or dolphins in captivity rules that out. And what remains is likely to be subscale and need investment. Its largest Chinese shareholder, who bought in when the stock was around a fifth higher, may not be ready to sell. Without a clear plan for the rest of the business, Merlin\u2019s next meal is likely to remain elusive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Geologist Bets on a North Sea Gusher That May Never Come", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil and Money\u201cGetting early geological information is worth its weight in gold,\u201d he said in an interview.The effort turned out to be worthwhile. A well, in an area called Lancaster, that Mr. Trice\u2019s company, Hurricane Energy, drilled on, produced oil at the very healthy rate of 15,000 barrels a day, suggesting the presence of very promising resources.Mr. Trice was taking advantage of the sharp drop in costs of drilling to pursue his sometimes quixotic 12-year quest to prove that undiscovered troves of oil still lie in British waters \u2014 if you just know where to look.People who know Mr. Trice often use the words \u201cvisionary\u201d and \u201cdetermined\u201d to describe him. A former employee of Royal Dutch Shell, Mr. Trice has been working on his project since 2005, spending about $200 million. The effort has been long, and has brought criticism from some of his investors.Mr. Trice estimates that there are 2.3 billion barrels of oil trapped in the rocks at Lancaster, of which more than a half billion barrels can be extracted. If these estimates are correct, Lancaster would be larger than any oil field developed in British waters over the last decade.\u201cThe scale of oil that is down there is very large compared to everywhere else in Europe, \u201csaid Kevin Swann, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultants.If Mr. Trice is successful, he could also open a new way of thinking about exploring in European waters. Hurricane also made two other discoveries last year in areas called Halifax and Lincoln, adding to others made in previous years. The company has locked up five exploration licenses around the finds that could prove valuable.\u201cIf we demonstrate that these rock types are viable in the U.K., then this is potentially the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Mr. Trice, who owns 1.5 percent of Hurricane. \u201cThis is potentially billions of barrels.\u201dLancaster was discovered in 1974 by Shell, but only recently has technology advanced enough that an explorer like Mr. Trice can hope to accurately map the best fracture zones and then drill horizontally across them, tapping oil. Only a coterie of industry experts work on these formations.\u201cIt is a specialist play, \u201c said Roy Kelly, an executive at Kerogen Capital, a private equity fund that has invested more than $100 million in Hurricane, and a Hurricane board member. \u201cYou need specialists like Robert and his team.\u201dHurricane is a tiny company with only 15 employees, but it has been one of the most active drillers in Europe. Other companies have reduced their exploration budgets to cope with lower oil prices. Mr. Trice drilled four wells last year when only 14 exploration wells were drilled in British waters.While explorers are excited about the west of Shetland because there has been much less drilling there than in the North Sea, remote locations and harsh weather mean that working in the area is expensive. The region has largely been the province of well-financed companies like BP, Chevron and Total rather than start-ups like Hurricane.\u201cIt is an incredible story what Hurricane has achieved, \u201c said Ian Linnett, head of equity services at RPS Energy, an independent consulting firm hired by Hurricane to assess the company\u2019s discoveries.A 12\u00bc-inch bit used to drill the rocks above the reservoir of a fractured basement, ancient rocks containing oil that are usually deep in the earth\u2019s crust.Mr. Linnett compared Hurricane\u2019s exploits to last year\u2019s shocking win by Leicester City of the Premier League, Britain\u2019s top soccer competition, a team that is usually outgunned by bigger, free-spending teams.Small companies like Hurricane take risks to make breakthrough discoveries and then large companies buy stakes in the projects or take the small companies over, but although Hurricane has looked for partners to provide the billions of dollars that bringing its discoveries to market would eventually require, the big oil companies have declined to bite.Analysts say that while fractured basements have produced oil over long periods in places including Vietnam and Egypt, they are unproven in Britain. These plays are also geologically complex and risky, and people in the industry say it is very difficult to evaluate how much oil they actually contain. Even though the test wells have been prolific for a short time, that performance does not guarantee that the field would function as well long term. One major worry is that the wells will suck in water from underlying aquifers into the fractures, complicating operations.\u201cNobody has jumped in because the technical risks are too high at this early stage, \u201c said Chris Cornelius, a British geologist and oil entrepreneur.To win over skeptics, Mr. Trice is moving ahead with a major test of whether his theories work. He has lined up a floating production platform \u2014 essentially a ship\u2019s hull bristling with oil production equipment \u2014 and plans to produce from two wells, starting in 2019.To pay for this project, Hurricane, which is listed on the London AIM small company exchange, raised more than $500 million this year. The stock price fell sharply before the fund-raising, angering some investors. In September, for instance, the Crystal Amber Fund, a major shareholder in Hurricane, wrote in its annual report that it was \u201cbaffled\u201d that the company \u201cchose not to discuss or consult\u201d with the fund on the tactics it used in rounding up the money. Hurricane says the funds enabled it to \u201cstay on track.\u201dDespite such stumbles, Crystal Amber and other investors say that Hurricane\u2019s discoveries offer potential rewards. The question is whether Mr. Trice and his team can actually prove that their ideas work.\u201cI think there is generally a very positive view of Dr. Trice in terms of his geological prowess,\u201d said Sanjeev Bahl, an oil analyst at Edison, a market research firm. Hurricane\u2019s management has \u201cless of a track record in funding large oil and gas development projects, \u201d he said.Mr. Trice says he is confident that the pilot project will make money:around $100 million a year if oil averages $50 a barrel. \u201cThere is some real money in this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not just a science experiment.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of oil that could be recovered from an area called Lancaster in British waters. It is more than half a billion barrels, not more than half a million.Advertisement"}

The cawing of birds, the heavy breathing on the phone, the dun-dun-dun-dun of the approaching shark \u2014 these are largely lost on Ms. Simmonds, the 14-year-old ing\u00e9nue who has just made her debut in Todd Haynes\u2019s \u201cWonderstruck.\u201d She is deaf.\u201cScary movies depend on sound a lot to scare people,\u201d she said recently, signing in a FaceTime interview from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., as her mother interpreted off-camera. \u201cWhen I look around and see people are jumping in their seats, I think: Why? Why? Nothing happened!\u201d\u201cI was completely shocked by how little dialogue there was in the film,\u201d Mr. Haynes said in a phone interview. To approximate a nearly soundless world before production, he and Oakes wore noise-canceling headphones as they walked around New York City one day. He became aware of \u201cacute shards of visual information,\u201d he said, though he wasn\u2019t kidding himself that he had any idea what it was like to live deafness: \u201cThis was a thumbnail version of anything close to life.\u201dLike Rose and Ben, Carol Padden and her husband, Tom Humphries, who both teach at the University of California, San Diego, represent different deaf experiences. Ms. Padden, a MacArthur Fellow for her research in world sign languages, was born deaf to deaf parents and grew up in deaf culture. Mr. Humphries lost his hearing when he was 6, had no deaf family and did not learn sign language until he went to college. The couple were advisers for \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d both the book and the movie.Ms. Padden and Mr. Humphries would like to see more deaf actors in film \u2014 and not just as deaf characters. Deaf actors played nonspeaking hearing roles \u2014 a policeman and a maid, among others \u2014 in \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d and as a fun exercise, Ms. Padden said in an email, she tried to figure out who was deaf in the movie. \u201cThere was one I missed,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is a good sign of his acting. I heard that as they prepared to play their roles, they were told to look \u2018less intently\u2019 at others so they would seem more hearing.\u201dBut authenticity works both ways. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for hearing actors to look deaf to deaf viewers,\u201d Ms. Padden said, since American Sign Language is not just a finger alphabet but a system of expression employing the whole body. \u201cFor hearing viewers,\u201d she said, \u201cbeing \u2018deaf\u2019 is about signing, or seeming silent, but for deaf viewers, it\u2019s the entire embodiment of that life: the eyes, the shoulders, the hands, the walking and of course the looking. Until hearing viewers see deaf actors playing them, they may not realize entirely the hard work of embodying an entire different kind of life.\u201dMr. Haynes said there was discussion about hiring a deaf actor for the adult Rose, but he said the film needed stars to get financing and \u201cthe only role that offered itself that kind of status was the role of Rose.\u201d He turned to Ms. Moore. \u201cShe took on the responsibility of that character and the research with great seriousness.\u201dMr. Humphries, in an email, said that the movie \u201csucceeded way better than most,\u201d but he also said that \u201cyou can\u2019t achieve authenticity without much more participation of deaf people in all aspects of a movie about deaf people.\u201dMs. Matlin said that \u201cnot so much\u201d has changed since \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d when it comes to studio movies. In independent films, \u201cwhere budgets are smaller,\u201d she said, \u201crisks can be taken, and there has been some progress.\u201d A recent Ukrainian film, \u201cThe Tribe,\u201d has gone further than any Hollywood movie. It was filmed entirely in Ukrainian Sign Language, with a cast of deaf actors, and no subtitles or voice-overs.Still, Ms. Matlin pointed out that on TV and streaming services, \u201cthere are many, many deaf actors, writers, directors and producers \u2014 and lots of stories to tell.\u201dIn films, by contrast, there isn\u2019t much nuance in telling the story of a deaf character, she said: \u201cUsually they\u2019re victims, or their deafness creates some sort of jeopardy.\u201d\u201cDeaf filmmaking is ascendant,\u201d he said in an email, \u201clikely due to the ease of communication afforded by a common language between deaf actors, creatives and techies.\u201d He also said that he was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by the success of \u201cSwitched at Birth,\u201d adding, \u201cI never thought I would ever see this in my lifetime.\u201dMillie Simmonds has seen neither \u201cThe Tribe\u201d nor \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d (they both have very adult themes), and she \u201cnever, never never\u201d dreamed of being an actress. \u201cI always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or do something dangerous,\u201d she said. But here she was in Poughkeepsie, already at work in her second movie, \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.

But they\u2019re an increasingly isolated group within their own party.While Republicans earlier this year set out to rewrite the tax code without blowing a hole in the national budget, most Hill Republicans, from G.O.P. leaders to conservatives have started to side with [Trump\u2019s budget chief Mick] Mulvaney, acknowledging that they\u2019ll grow the deficit for a time with the tax package.What Washington disarray means for businessCorporate America is growing anxious, in part because of the upheaval in the nation\u2019s capital.According to the two latest surveys by Chief Executive, September and October\u2019s ratings for expected business conditions 12 months from now have slumped to their lowest level since November 2016.

{"Headline": "Vance Returned Trump Lawyer\u2019s Donation After Reporters\u2019 Questions", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., last week returned a five-year-old campaign contribution from President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer after journalists raised questions about Mr. Vance\u2019s 2012 decision to end a criminal investigation into fraud allegations against Mr. Trump and his children, a spokesman for Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign said.\u201cThe idea for me that I would make a case decision for $5,000, or $50,000 or $100,000, is ludicrous, because it\u2019s so much more important for me to have the work of this office be perceived as fair and unbiased and not for sale,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNone of the decisions revolved around campaign contributions at all, or anything other than my assessment that this was not a case the office should prosecute, on the merits.\u201dOne of the contributions, for $25,000, was returned in May 2012, just before Mr. Kasowitz met with Mr. Vance and two senior prosecutors to argue the Trumps had done nothing illegal. Mr. Vance ended the investigation three months later.Mr. Kasowitz said in an email that he had contributed to Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign because he was \u201cextremely impressed by Cy Vance as a person of impeccable integrity.\u201d He denied he had given with the expectation of a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201dMr. Vance said he had called off the investigation in large part because the victims refused to cooperate with prosecutors after they reached a civil settlement with the Trumps and their business partners. Their refusal to testify willingly made it doubly difficult to get an indictment or prove the case in court. In addition, the victims had not lost money, nor had they been sold something of no value.\u201cThe victims didn\u2019t strike me as victims, and I have better things to do with the resources of the office,\u201d Mr. Vance said.Under the settlement, in November 2011, Mr. Trump and his co-defendants agreed to refund 90 percent of $3.16 million in deposits to the buyers, while admitting no wrongdoing. But the buyers also agreed to notify the district attorney\u2019s office that they would not help the investigation. Their lawyer wrote a letter to Mr. Vance stating the plaintiffs had settled the lawsuit amicably and that, in their view, the defendants had not broken the law.Mr. Vance said that from the start of the investigation, he had doubts the misrepresentations rose to the level of a crime. He said there was a legal debate over whether the Martin Act, a state law that bans false statements to sell a security, could be applied to the real estate transactions in question. Still, he directed his Major Economic Crimes Bureau to dig into it.At the start, the Trumps\u2019 defense team included Gary Naftalis and Paul Grand, both well-known defense lawyers. Neither met with Mr. Vance during negotiations with prosecutors.Mr. Kasowitz, who had long represented Mr. Trump in civil matters, got involved in the case in early 2012 after the civil settlement, asking for a meeting Mr. Vance, he said.Daniel R. Alonso, the chief deputy district attorney at the time, said after he heard about the upcoming meeting, he directed the campaign to return $25,000 Mr. Kasowitz had donated in January 2012.The meeting lasted a half-hour on May 16, 2012. Besides Mr. Vance, Mr. Alonso and Adam Kaufmann, the chief of the investigative division, were there.Mr. Vance said he did not make a final decision until three months later, after several more discussions with his team of prosecutors about the evidence, including incriminating emails gathered through a subpoena supporting the theory that the Trumps had exaggerated sales.In January 2013, Mr. Kasowitz held a Republican fund-raiser for Mr. Vance and made his own $32,000 contribution. That second donation, Mr. Vance said, went through a rigorous vetting process that his office uses for all donations to identify conflicts of interest, including a final review by his chief deputy at the time, Mr. Alonso. Mr. Vance said his campaign accepted the donation because Mr. Kasowitz no longer had any cases pending before the office.He said he never solicited the donation, nor did he recall receiving it until reporters contacted him about it a few weeks ago. He and his aides made the decision to return the contribution, he said, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.\u201cIn hindsight I would not have taken it,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of a Republican fund-raiser where Marc Kasowitz made a $32,000 donation to the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. It was January 2013, not January 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Bedtime Story Is a Podcast", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe public radio tradition that\u2019s powered the recent podcast boom never invested much in children\u2019s audio. But now that podcasting has allowed for endless shows on demand, audio makers are eager to get their content straight to children\u2019s ears. And the technology that made podcasts possible \u2014 the smartphone \u2014 has also gifted its producers a golden sales pitch: Podcasts are being pushed as a guilt-free alternative to screen time, a more engaging option than zoned-out YouTube bingeing or hypnotizing mobile games.Getting kids to listen in, though, is harder than it sounds. Podcast makers are trying to create an entirely new form \u2014 one that needs to train kids and parents to follow entirely new family traditions. Sticking a kid in front of the morning cartoons may carry a whiff of stigma now, but it\u2019s just as easy as it ever was. Also, it\u2019s free. Partly because children\u2019s podcast creators are claiming the moral high ground on screen time, advertising is controversial for the medium. Pinna is charging $7.99 a month for its ad-free offerings. Whether parents will pay up remains to be seen.Andy Bowers, Panoply\u2019s chief content officer, has been puzzling over how to turn children\u2019s audio into a sustainable enterprise for a couple of decades. Before he created Slate\u2019s podcast network and spun it off into its own business, Panoply, he spent 17 years in public radio, where he tried unsuccessfully to evangelize for kids\u2019 programming.The conventional wisdom for radio stations was to stick with just one format \u2014 music or news. Producers were loath to abandon their dedicated adult audiences and try to wrangle children in front of the radio for an hour a day. So in 2005, just as the podcast was emerging as a form, Mr. Bowers started his own homemade kids\u2019 show with his 5-year-old daughter, Emma, taping episodes in a closet of their house.Now the series has found a home on Pinna, where it\u2019s been packaged along with a trove of exclusive audio content. Emma Bowers, now 17, collaborated with Mr. Bowers on an original \u201csound picture book\u201d for the app, \u201cKid Wash,\u201d which used a binaural recording system \u2014 a mold of a human head outfitted with microphones \u2014 to create a 3-D listening experience that feels unlike anything children can read or watch.Nonfiction content includes the kid\u2019s trivia game show \u201cExtraBLURT,\u201d the sports talk show \u201cGood Sport!\u201d and \u201cThe Show About Science.\u201d Come November, Pinna will debut a choose-your-own-adventure podcast and, in December, a series styled like an advent calendar, with an episode dropping each day leading up to Christmas.Podcast makers are hoping that as more and better content is made available, audio listening will become another family ritual, like reading books at bedtime or listening to kids\u2019 albums in the car. One of Pinna\u2019s marketing pitches is an attempt to establish new habits: \u201cIt\u2019s for car time, play time, family time, chore time, bed time, any time.\u201dPartly because kids\u2019 podcasts are trying to situate themselves as a more virtuous alternative to screen time, advertising to kids is a sticky issue. In the grown-up world, podcasters typically appeal to advertisers with boundless editorial flexibility; marketing pitches are often written, produced and performed by the hosts themselves.On \u201cWow in the World,\u201d Mr. Raz and Ms. Thomas have opted to aim commercials at the parents who are listening in. Before a break, a child\u2019s voice announces: \u201cGrown-ups, this message is for you,\u201d and then an adult voice-over artist reads ads for parent stuff like a meal-kit service or a sock start-up. Meanwhile, Panoply is hoping that parents will pay $7.99 a month for the ad-free Pinna. \u201cI just think it\u2019s coercive,\u201d said Mr. Bowers of advertising to kids. To reach a broader audience, Pinna will also offer select episodes of its shows for free; those won\u2019t have ads, either.If podcasters manage to capture the kids\u2019 market, they stand to create podcast listeners for life. James Kee, the 7-year-old fan of \u201cWow in the World\u201d, has already started branching out to more advanced fare. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to a little bit of \u2018Pod Save America,\u2019\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to Gen-Z Media\u2019s connection to the podcast \u201cThe Unexplainable Disappearance of Mars Patel.\u201d As the article correctly noted, the company\u2019s principals were creators of the show, but Gen-Z did not produce \u201cMars Patel.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Randal Quarles Confirmed as Federal Reserve Governor", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Thursday confirmed Randal K. Quarles as the Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, an important victory for the Trump administration in its campaign to ease some financial regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis.President Trump also must decide whether to replace or renominate the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, when her term ends in February.\u201cI do think the Fed can look at being more transparent about those activities and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t reduce the effectiveness of those tests,\u201d Mr. Quarles said.He will also play a role in evaluating the \u201cliving wills\u201d that large banks must submit to demonstrate that, in the event of failure, their businesses could be wound down without requiring government assistance. Here, too, the banks have grappled with regulators over the stringency of the requirements.And he must wrestle with which banks deserve tougher Fed scrutiny. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law requires banks with assets of more than $50 billion to face a stricter set of rules. While there is a consensus that the government should ease the regulatory burden on community banks and limit the most stringent regulations to the very largest financial institutions, writing new rules remains a challenge. Some within the industry, including big bank trade groups, want the Fed to use a \u201crisk-based\u201d assessment, versus a size threshold, to determine which banks warrant tougher scrutiny. Other banks, particularly smaller regional firms, say the threshold should be raised to $250 billion from $50 billion. The Fed has already eased the qualitative provision of the stress tests on banks with less than $250 billion in assets.Mr. Quarles is less likely to have an immediate influence on monetary policy, but he has criticized the Fed for trying too hard to stimulate the economy, and he is expected to favor raising interest rates more quickly.He said at his confirmation hearing that the Fed should adopt a mathematical formula for determining the proper level of its benchmark rate. Some conservatives say that such a rule would make Fed policy more stable and predictable, which in turn would benefit the economy. But the idea is strongly opposed by the rest of the Fed\u2019s board, which argues that rules are helpful as references, but that policy making ultimately requires discretion.Mr. Quarles, 60, is a lawyer by training who worked in the financial industry before joining the Treasury Department in 2002 as assistant secretary for international affairs under President George W. Bush. He later served as under secretary for domestic finance. After leaving public service in 2006, he became a partner at the Carlyle Group and then helped to found the Cynosure Group, a private equity firm based in Utah.He is related by marriage to Marriner S. Eccles, the Fed\u2019s chairman from 1934 to 1948 and the namesake of the building where Mr. Quarles will now have an office.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greek Police Arrest Suspect in Letter Bomb Attacks", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The police in Greece on Saturday arrested a 29-year-old man who is suspected of being involved in a bomb plot that left one of the country\u2019s former prime ministers seriously injured.The police said they believed the man, whose name has not been immediately released, had sent a letter bomb this year to Lucas Papademos, the former prime minister. He is also suspected of sending several other devices to representatives of Greece\u2019s international creditors, including to Wolfgang Schaeuble, then Germany\u2019s finance minister; and to the Paris offices of the International Monetary Fund.Counterterrorism officers stopped the suspect while leaving an apartment block near central Athens on Saturday, while carrying several bags containing two pistols, 300 bullet cartridges, several detonators, cables, timers, gunpowder and eight fake identity cards, a police statement said.An investigating magistrate had issued a warrant for the suspect\u2019s arrest in connection with the letter bombs sent to \u201cvarious recipients in European Union countries\u201d in March and another device targeting Mr. Papademos in May, according to the statement.The suspect is believed to be linked to a Greek extremist anarchist group called Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire which claimed responsibility for sending the parcel to Mr. Schaeuble earlier this year.The group first made its mark with a barrage of parcel bombs sent to European leaders in 2010, when, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, Greece agreed to its first international bailout. Several convicted members of the group are serving long prison sentences for terrorist activities.Mr. Papademos, a 70-year-old economist who was prime minister for six months from late 2011 to early 2012 during the height of Greece\u2019s debt crisis, was seriously hurt when a parcel bomb exploded in his hands as he opened it in his car in Athens. No group claimed that attack, but at the time, the police drew parallels with earlier attacks targeting Mr. Schaeuble and the I.M.F. offices in March. In all the cases, the letter bombs contained gunpowder.The device sent to the I.M.F. slightly injured an employee, while the bomb sent to Mr. Schaeuble a day earlier was intercepted by staff at the ministry in Berlin before anyone opened it.That same month, Greek police officers found eight other letter bombs at the capital\u2019s central post office sorting center that had been postmarked for other European officials and institutions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Passes Budget Blueprint, Clearing Path for Tax Overhaul", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican race to overhaul the tax code broke into a sprint on Thursday, with House members narrowly clearing a budget blueprint that would allow a tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes, and Senate leaders signaling that the bill could be introduced, debated and approved in both chambers by the end of November.Neither the retirement issue nor the squabble over the deduction for state and local taxes was resolved on Thursday, but party leaders vowed to push ahead at an even faster pace than they had previously outlined. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said his committee would introduce a bill on Nov. 1 and begin amending it on Nov. 6.The exacting pace is meant to maximize party cohesion and neutralize attacks by Democrats and business groups. If Republicans stick to it, they will speed what could be a 1,000-page piece of legislation, affecting every corner of the United States economy, through the House and the Senate in less than three weeks.Democrats were swift to criticize the approach, saying it was an attempt to hide tax changes that will hurt, not help, middle-class families. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill was shaping up to be \u201ca bunch of false promises to the middle class.\u201d Republicans, he said, \u201cknow the details \u2014 the specifics of what they\u2019re really about \u2014 will be hard to argue in the sunlight.\u201dLawmakers and committee staff members must still resolve some of the thorniest issues before they can release a bill, including where to draw income lines for tax brackets, how high to set the top personal income tax rate and how to ensure that major changes to the way that multinational corporations are taxed do not encourage them to shift more money overseas. The biggest question is how to offset enough tax revenue that will be lost from cutting rates to remain within the rules of the Senate budget reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass a Democratic filibuster.The budget measure passed over the loud protests of House members from New York and New Jersey, who worry that the blueprint will doom the current deduction for state and local taxes \u2014 a benefit of great importance to taxpayers in their states. Eleven of the 20 Republicans who voted no were from those two states.\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d one of those lawmakers, Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, a Republican, said after the vote. \u201cI am confident we\u2019ll reach an agreement. And if we don\u2019t, then I don\u2019t see how we can move forward.\u201dMr. Brady told reporters later in the day that while no such agreement had yet been reached, it would eventually be resolved, since families in New York and New Jersey needed to be \u201cbetter off\u201d after a tax bill passes.\u201cThis is a serious issue, and we\u2019re taking it seriously,\u201d Mr. Brady said. Republican lawmakers from those states \u201cmade it clear they need this problem solved before they vote yes on tax reform,\u201d he added.Democrats were quick to seize on the discord. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin had put his party\u2019s control of the House at even greater risk through his \u201cfoolish decision to force his most vulnerable members to walk the plank on a toxic tax increase.\u201d\u201cAnybody who votes for this thing should have their head examined if they live where we do,\u201d said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York.House Republicans, over Mr. Trump\u2019s public objections, are considering changes to the tax treatment of retirement accounts, including potentially lowering the pretax amounts that Americans may contribute to their 401(k) accounts each year. On Thursday, Mr. Brady hinted that the bill may raise the limit on the total amount Americans can save in tax-preferred accounts but shift the tax preference to the back end, so that a larger share of those contributions are taxed up front, instead of when they are withdrawn, as is the case with 401(k) plans.Such a change would produce more tax revenues in the short term, at the expense of the long run, which would help Republicans make their tax math work. One possible reason to consider that change would be to offset revenues lost from a deal to preserve some of the state and local deduction for individuals.A budget blueprint passed by the House earlier this month called for a more aggressive approach on deficits and spending cuts. In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House\u2019s plan would have instructed committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings. The House\u2019s plan also called for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit. But the House ultimately agreed to approve the Senate version of the budget to speed the tax overhaul effort.House Republicans were \u201casked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody\u2019s read,\u201d Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, complained this week.Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that taking up the Senate plan was not an ideal outcome, but she talked up the promise of overhauling taxes.\u201cPresident Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly,\u201d she said.And while Republicans expressed cautious optimism that they could resolve their differences, avoid lobbying pitfalls and deliver the bill to Mr. Trump for his signature in December, Democrats warned that the ride could be rough.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand why they want to rush a bill like this through, because the more people see it, the less they\u2019ll like it,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a lot tougher for them to get it done than they think.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Visiting a Tailor in Hong Kong? Be Specific", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal ShoppingHONG KONG \u2014 Think of a major city, and you often think of a business. In London, it\u2019s the pub; in Tokyo, the sushi restaurant, and so on.In Hong Kong, it\u2019s the tailor\u2019s shop, home to a magician with cloth who can take your measurements one morning and produce a finished suit the next day. It sounds like a stereotype, but this city of about 7.4 million has hundreds of such businesses, supported by legions of tailors and seamstresses toiling away in drab industrial workrooms tucked into out-of-the-way neighborhoods or across the border in mainland China.Residents here are used to visitors who ask for tailor recommendations, along with suggestions for the best dim sum and xiaolongbao (soup dumpling) and how to avoid waiting in lines for the Peak Tram. The usual advice begins with two points to be considered well before starting the hunt for the right shop.First, what do you want in the finished garment? In detail.But if you want specific features \u2014 topstitching, a watch pocket in trousers or channels for shirt collar stays \u2014 you have to say so when you place the order.Another possibility: Bring a favorite garment to be copied. (And that\u2019s what will be produced: an exact copy.)Second, consider your travel schedule. Many tailors can, indeed, produce a suit overnight \u2014 or will measure you just before you dash to the airport train, then send the finished garment by express delivery. But having at least one fitting, and preferably two, will produce a much better result. So maybe it\u2019s worth skipping the Big Buddha on Lantau Island if you don\u2019t have a lot of time.Once you\u2019re ready to find a tailor, many concierges (even if you\u2019re not staying in his or her hotel) will be happy to make recommendations. Or search online for \u201cHong Kong tailors\u201d and scroll through the scores of blog posts, horror stories and even a few tales of praise.One common warning: Ignore the men who try to hand you a tailor\u2019s leaflet as you exit the Star Ferry terminal in Kowloon. Most of those operations are low-end businesses with second-rate fabrics and poor quality control.Thinking about the quality of garment you want may help you narrow your choices.Central, the cluster of glass-and-metal skyscrapers on Hong Kong Island, is the city\u2019s traditional finance and banking neighborhood, so tailors there primarily cater to executives who want classic styles in top-end suiting materials from Ermenegildo Zegna, Loro Piana, Dormeuil or one of the many heritage woolen brands in Britain. Most customers are men; women can get coats, pantsuits, and jacket and skirt combinations, but they are likely to lack the kind of fashion-forward styling seen on the runways in Paris or Milan.Several tailors in Tsim Sha Tsui, commonly called TST, the shopping and entertainment center at the tip of the Kowloon peninsula, also serve executive tastes, but many in this tourist haven also have a broad range of lower-end fabrics.Fabric is a good indicator of price. A suit made from top-quality materials, which will pack with little wrinkling and keep its shape over time, is likely to cost from $1,500 to more than $3,000. Moderately priced fabrics will result in lower-priced garments. But, regardless of what someone on the internet says, a $300 suit that will fit perfectly, wear like a dream and last for decades is a fantasy.Suzie Wong might have known such a tailor, although that 1960s styling would be awfully dated these days.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Targeting Political Groups, I.R.S. Crossed Party Lines", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal watchdog investigating whether the Internal Revenue Service unfairly targeted conservative political groups seeking tax-exempt status said that the agency also scrutinized organizations associated with liberal causes from 2004 to 2013.The exhaustive report, which examined nine years worth of applications for tax-exempt status, comes after a similar audit in 2013 found that groups with conservative names like \u201cTea Party,\u201d \u201cpatriot\u201d or \u201c9/12\u201d were unfairly targeted for further review.The new report found that the I.R.S. was also inappropriately targeting progressive-leaning groups. While the investigation does not specify the political affiliations of the groups, names that were flagged included the words \u201cProgressive,\u201d \u201cOccupy,\u201d \u201cGreen Energy,\u201d and Acorn \u2014 the acronym for the now defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.A spokeswoman for the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration noted that the report makes no characterization of the political leanings of any of the groups.The I.R.S. came under fire for its aggressive questioning of conservative groups in 2013. After a surge in applications for tax-exempt status between 2010 and 2012, the agency acknowledged that it began singling out terms such as \u201cTea Party\u201d and \u201cpatriot\u201d as a shortcut for determining if organizations were actually engaging in social welfare, which would qualify them for tax-exempt status, or if they might be political organizations.Organizations that were flagged by the I.R.S. as potentially political had to undergo intensive requests for information about any legislative activities.Ahead of the 2014 midterm elections, Republicans regularly used the scandal to bludgeon Democrats and paint the Obama administration as corrupt. But now it appears that the I.R.S. was an equal offender.\u201cThis report shows the I.R.S. deep scrutiny of political groups is in fact bipartisan, it is liberal and conservative groups that the I.R.S. has been targeting,\u201d said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.Rather than condemn the I.R.S. actions, Democrats on Thursday celebrated the findings as evidence that Republicans were wrong to claim bias at the I.R.S. Democrats had previously been critical of the 2013 Treasury report since it only looked at two years of applications.\u201cAfter years of baseless claims and false accusations it is my hope Republicans will finally put an end to this witch hunt and admit that their attacks on the I.R.S. were nothing but political grandstanding on behalf of special interests at the expense of American taxpayers,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.Republicans, however, are not prepared to let the I.R.S. off the hook and seized on the report as evidence that the agency must be reformed.\u201cThis report reinforces what government watchdogs and congressional investigators have confirmed time and time again: Bureaucrats at the I.R.S., such as Lois Lerner, arbitrarily and haphazardly administered the tax code and targeted taxpayers based on political ideology,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder the American people have lost faith in the I.R.S.\u201dAs recently as April, House members called for the firing of Mr. Koskinen for the \u201cgross mishandling\u201d of its investigation into the targeting of political groups.Despite the uproar from Republicans, President Trump has not taken any steps to fire Mr. Koskinen, whose term ends next month.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the time you finish reading this article, the upstart sports news outlet called The Athletic probably will have hired another well-known sportswriter from your local newspaper. In a couple of years, once The Athletic has completed its breakneck expansion, perhaps that newspaper\u2019s sports section will no longer exist.The Athletic is a subscription sports website and app featuring pages of local articles that roughly replicate newspaper sports sections. It launched in Chicago in January 2016 and has expanded to full coverage in seven cities, hockey coverage in eight more, national college basketball and football sites, and plans for more. Subscribers get access to all of it.The Athletic is already one of the biggest sports media companies in the country, with about 65 editorial employees. \u201cOur ambition is to be the local sports page for every city in the country,\u201d Mather said.To understand why The Athletic is so brazen about its vulture strategy, one must appreciate the state of play at local and regional newspapers throughout the country. Under dire financial duress, many have put extraordinary demands on beat writers to produce heavy volumes of content, often without wage increases. The reporters are sometimes the most knowledgeable sources of information on the teams they cover, but they are afforded little opportunity to step back and write impactful articles.These reporters are skilled experts feeling the strains of a crippled industry, and many are looking for a way out. Mather knows it.Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn\u2019t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually \u2014 less with frequently offered discounts \u2014 for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won\u2019t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is, What happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic\u2019s business model allow it to survive that long?Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don\u2019t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.\u201cI think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don\u2019t treat it well,\u201d Mather said.After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,\u201d Hansmann said.The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.\u201cIt was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,\u201d said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic\u2019s largest investors, \u201cand knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.\u201dThe Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even \u2014 Chicago and the Bay Area and \u201ca few smaller markets\u201d are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said \u2014 but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. \u201cBuilding a company is exciting,\u201d he said, but the \u201cbigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.\u201dNow the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. \u201cIf there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team\u201d in a city, Hansmann said, \u201cthat\u2019s the starting point.\u201dIt is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic\u2019s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a na\u00efve pivot to video.But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic \u2014 four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.In an email, Kovacevic said that Mather and Hansmann had approached him to be an adviser but that they couldn\u2019t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.Mather said that when The Athletic\u2019s executives spoke with Kovacevic, they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann \u201conly make \u2018promises\u2019 to our customers, employees, investors and partners.\u201d\u201cWe are doing great work,\u201d Mather said. \u201cWe treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that\u2019s on them.\u201dMather and Hansmann also don\u2019t hew to traditional \u2014 they would say antiquated \u2014 norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season-ticket holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was that the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.Similarly, many of The Athletic\u2019s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, \u201cAdvertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,\u201d before adding that it would have to be \u201ccustomer centric.\u201dMather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.As The Athletic\u2019s costs rise \u2014 it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel \u2014 the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.\u201cIn a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,\u201d Mather said. \u201cThat is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,\u201d he added, and he says they aren\u2019t served well. \u201cBleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.\u201dMore journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals \u2014 like The Information and Politico Pro \u2014 or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers \u2014 like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. \u201cThe advertising business model does not align with quality,\u201d Mather said. \u201cIt\u2019s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it\u2019s short-term instead of long-term, it\u2019s serving sponsors instead of users, it\u2019s thinking big instead of great.\u201d\u201cIt really comes down to the business model,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is our core belief.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malliotakis Outpaces de Blasio in Latest Fund-Raising Period", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNicole Malliotakis, the Republican candidate for mayor, raised more money than Mayor Bill de Blasio did in late September, according to information submitted to the New York City Campaign Finance Board.She also raised more than the mayor in contributions that qualify for public financing under the board\u2019s matching funds program \u2014 although she still has significantly less money overall.Ms. Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman from Staten Island, reported taking in $107,566 from Sept. 19 through Oct. 2, compared with $83,414 for Mr. de Blasio. Of that, $41,000 qualify for public matching funds; at the six-to-one match, that means she would be eligible to receive an additional $246,000.Under the program, the first $175 received from most donors who reside in New York City are eligible for matching payments.Her surge derives partly from the nature of her campaign: She joined the race in the spring, had no Republican primary, and has only recently pressed on the fund-raising gas pedal as the Nov. 7 general election approaches.Mr. de Blasio, Ms. Malliotakis and an independent candidate, Bo Dietl, will meet on Tuesday in the first of two scheduled televised debates.Mr. de Blasio took in $10,811 in matchable donations. That brings his total matchable donations to date to $581,000, compared with $332,000 for Ms. Malliotakis. Both campaigns have already received a portion of the public funds they are due under the program.Mr. de Blasio reported having $2.3 million in the bank at the end of the reporting period. Ms. Malliotakis had $760,000 in cash.Mr. Dietl, a former police detective who runs a private investigation firm, raised $13,075. He is not participating in the matching funds program. He has $163,299 in the bank.Sal F. Albanese, who is running on the Reform Party line, raised just $215. Mr. Albanese is a Democrat who ran against Mr. de Blasio in the Democratic primary, but finished a distant second and has taken in few contributions since then. He reported having $23,451 available to spend.Mr. Albanese has been excluded from next week\u2019s debate because he did not meet the debate criteria set out by the Campaign Finance Board. He has filed a lawsuit seeking to join the debate, and an emergency hearing on the suit was held on Friday in state appellate court.In a somewhat favorable development for Mr. Albanese, Associate Justice Sallie Manzanet-Daniels ruled that the case should be heard by a full panel of the court\u2019s First Judicial Department. But the hearing will not take place until several days after the first debate.\u201cWe won, but we lost,\u201d Mr. Albanese said.Ms. Malliotakis qualified for the debate with a fund-raising surge in mid-September that also put her over the threshold qualifying her to receive matching funds. At the time, as an earlier contribution reporting deadline neared on Sept. 18, her campaign was worried that she might fall short of the $250,000 in total qualifying contributions required to begin receiving the matching money \u2014 which she desperately needed for a television advertising push.State Republican leaders reached out for help, including to the Republican National Committee. Soon, they pulled together an email list of thousands of potential contributors \u2014 including many from the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 according to a person familiar with the effort.\u201cWe had been reaching out for all sorts of lists,\u201d said Rob Ryan, a spokesman for Ms. Malliotakis. \u201cWith fund-raising, a sense of urgency is always needed.\u201dIn a three-day rush, from Sept. 16 through the Sept. 18 deadline, Ms. Malliotakis and her staff raised $39,800 in qualifying funds from about 620 people, according to the earlier campaign filing. That surge allowed her to pass the threshold and gain access to about $1.5 million in public funds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Electric Car and a Rugged Throwback: The Dreams of 2 Rich Britons", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsLONDON \u2014 Two of Britain\u2019s boldest and wealthiest entrepreneurs are trying to break into a very tough league.James Dyson, best known for innovative vacuum cleaners, said recently that he was preparing to introduce a new electric car and had 400 people working on the project. And Jim Ratcliffe, a billionaire petrochemical executive, is so upset about Jaguar Land Rover deciding to end production of the Defender that he said he would put a healthy slice of his fortune into producing what he calls \u201ca spiritual successor\u201d to the classic vehicle of explorers and safaris.These new projects, announced within a couple weeks of each other, sent a burst of excitement through the British car industry, which has been worried about the fallout from Britain\u2019s plans to leave the European Union trading bloc. The Daily Mail, a large circulation tabloid, even said that Dyson\u2019s plans \u201cwould pose a threat to the Silicon Valley giant Tesla.\u201dBut breaking into the car business is far more complex than it might appear at first glance. A new carmaker must design the vehicle and figure out how to manufacture it \u2014 and that is only the beginning. Success requires a number of to-dos: effective marketing, a dealer network and, perhaps, arranging buyer financing.\u201cThere is a huge list,\u201d said Peter Wells, a professor at Cardiff Business School in Wales. \u201cThat has been one of the reasons why the barriers to entry in the automotive industry have been relatively high.\u201dStill, Mr. Wells said that the car industry is \u201cat a very important pivot point in its history now, where a combination of factors are radically altering what is possible.\u201d And Mr. Dyson, 70, and Mr. Ratcliffe, 65, could be in a position to take advantage.New technologies like electric and autonomously driven vehicles are forcing major changes while the center of gravity in the car business is shifting toward Asia. \u201cThere is a lot of fluidity in the entire industry space, which is what these players see,\u201d Mr. Wells said.In an interview at a pub called The Grenadier in London, Mr. Ratcliffe explained that terminating the much-loved Defender would create demand for a replacement because it \u201chad left quite a hole in the marketplace.\u201d He criticized the many SUVs still being sold as \u201cjelly molds\u201d that all look alike.Mr. Ratcliffe owns two versions of the Defender \u2014 one from 1955 and a so-called Heritage model made near the end of its production run. He said he wants to preserve the Defender\u2019s boxy, military-style ruggedness.Toby Ecuyer, a yacht designer, has the job of turning Mr. Ratcliffe\u2019s ideas into drawings. \u201cWhat we are trying to design is something extremely utilitarian,\u201d not a luxury vehicle, he said.Mr. Ratcliffe conceded that the new vehicle will need updates to meet global safety and emission standards, including in the United States, where its sales stopped in 1997. He said he planned to make about 25,000 vehicles a year \u2014 about the number of Defenders sold in 2015, the year before its production was halted.Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata, an India-based conglomerate, has found success with luxury models like the Range Rover. The company said in a statement that it had plans for the Defender and would pay close attention to any actions regarding its \u201cproprietary rights.\u201dMr. Ratcliffe built a $40 billion per year petrochemical empire called Ineos by buying chemical plants that other companies wanted to discard and then running them more efficiently. He said he can also find cheaper ways to operate a car company as well.According to his team, for instance, European manufacturers had already expressed an interest in either building his car on contract or selling him a fully equipped plant. Either way, that would help limit upfront investment and risk. He said he did not want to put in more than 600 million pounds \u2014 less than the $1 billion analysts estimate that development and production of a new model typically costs.Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, director of the CAR center at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said he doubted that an updated version of an old concept would have appeal beyond a dwindling group of enthusiasts. A few would buy Mr. Ratcliffe\u2019s car, he said, but it would \u201cbecome a niche which gets smaller over time.\u201dMr. Dyson has been much more guarded about his plans. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sports car and not a very cheap car,\u201d he told reporters at his company store on London\u2019s bustling Oxford Street in late September. He recounted that in the 1990s he had designed a device for cleaning truck exhaust but received a cool reception from vehicle manufacturers. Instead, he focused his efforts on electric motors and batteries, hoping that one day he could step up to cars.He has reached that point. Mr. Dyson has purchased a World War II-era airfield near his company\u2019s headquarters in Malmesbury, in southern England, where the development work will continue. He said the new vehicle will offer a \u201cradical\u201d electric motor design that he said would be more efficient than those available on the market now.Mr. Dyson has proved himself a dogged inventor, designing high-end vacuum cleaners and other products like hair dryers. His technological savvy gives him a chance of scoring a hit in the much more complex and costly global car industry, analysts said. In 2015, he bought Sakti3, an American start-up that is working with solid state batteries. Mr. Dyson said he could be on track to commercializing a so-called solid state battery, which analysts say might be more powerful and safer than the lithium ion devices now used in electric cars and cellphones. He said both the start-up and his own team were working on the project.\u201cThe edge that Dyson have if they do have an edge is to possibly be ahead of the game in solid state batteries,\u201d said Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank.As nascent as they are, the plans Mr. Dyson has laid out will be expensive, particularly for a medium-size company like Dyson. Mr. Dyson said he would spend \u00a31 billion on the car and another \u00a31 billion on the battery \u2014 a lot of money for a company that reported \u00a32.5 billion in revenue last year.He may need to spend more. Tesla, for instance, has already spent about $6 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates.Mr. Dyson said he planned to develop not only a new motor but a new chassis. \u201cWe are starting from scratch,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one that is suitable.\u201dElectric cars are clearly a high-risk venture. Mr. Houchois said none of the vehicles on the market, including those made by Tesla, which recently reported disappointing production numbers on its new Model 3, are making money for their owners. Dyson may seek to bring costs down by manufacturing in Asia, where it already makes appliances.Still, whatever his reputation, Mr. Dyson has set himself a formidable task. \u201cIt is one thing to design and manufacture a household item,\u201d said R. A. Farrokhnia, a professor at the business and engineering schools at Columbia University. \u201cAnd quite another to prototype and then build a complex electric vehicle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo, Mr. Diller agreed to revive the project, known as \u201cDiller Island,\u201d and opponents who had filed a series of lawsuits to stop the plan agreed to drop their legal battle.In return, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has promised to complete the 4.5-mile-long Hudson River Park \u2014 which stretches along the waterfront from Battery Park City to 59th Street and includes Pier 55 at the foot of 14th Street \u2014 and to protect the marine estuary from development.Mr. Diller said in a statement, \u201cI\u2019m going to make one last attempt to revive plans to build the park, so that the intended beneficiaries of our endeavor can fall in love with Pier 55 in the way all of us have.\u201dBut only 70 percent of the park has been built and the trust has struggled for funds to build new structures and maintain the ones it has, as they are battered by the river environment.Opponents of the project, including the City Club, a small civic organization; environmentalists; and the real estate developer Douglas Durst, had waged a legal battle in three different courts to stop the project. They argued that Pier 55 was developed in secret and without any consideration of alternatives for rebuilding Pier 54, the crumbling structure that the new pier was supposed to replace. They also questioned the need for another performance center in Manhattan, particularly one built over the river.In the spring, both Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio called Mr. Durst urging him to settle the dispute so that the project could move forward.By September, the six-year saga appeared to be coming to an end. By all accounts, the Hudson River Park Trust was only days away from a settlement with the City Club and Mr. Durst.But Mr. Diller had grown weary of the conflict as the cost of the project soared to $250 million from $130 million when it was publicly unveiled in 2014.Mr. Diller and others blamed the escalating costs on the opposition.The cost of most projects, whether new construction or a renovation, routinely increases as a development moves from concept to construction. Building on or over water is especially expensive because the wind, waves and marine animals are constantly wreaking havoc on any structure.According to Mr. Diller, the attempt to revive the project came together in the last week. The governor called him and offered to try and put together a deal.The governor\u2019s pledge to complete the park and protect the estuary was key in getting opponents to drop their legal fight, said Richard Emery, the lawyer for the City Club. In the past, park officials have said it would cost $200 million to finish the remaining 30 percent of the park, but state officials did not pledge a specific figure, instead saying they would work with the trust and Mr. Emery\u2019s clients to formulate a plan.Diana Taylor, the chair of the Hudson River Park Trust, said in a statement that \u201cit was a tragedy for the public that the project was canceled last month. We will work with all stakeholders to figure out a way forward.\u201dThe mayor said in an email that he applauded Mr. Diller\u2019s philanthropy and that his administration stood ready to assist in making the project happen.Mr. Diller, who had seemed distressed when he canceled the project, said Mr. Cuomo had called him shortly before announcing that a deal had been made.

{"Headline": "Trump Is Expected to Name Jerome Powell as Next Fed Chairman", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is expected to nominate Jerome H. Powell as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, replacing Janet L. Yellen, whose term expires early next year, according to two people familiar with the plans.Both people familiar with the president\u2019s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that Mr. Trump was notoriously mercurial and liked creating drama around important personnel decisions. However, both said the president appeared set on Mr. Powell. An announcement could come as soon as Thursday, after the Fed wraps up a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and before Mr. Trump leaves on Friday for a 12-day Asia trip.In looking past Ms. Yellen, Mr. Trump would be breaking with longstanding precedent. Every Fed chairman in modern history who completed a first four-year term was nominated for a second. The last three Fed chairmen were nominated for new terms by a president of the opposite party. And Mr. Trump has praised Ms. Yellen\u2019s performance: During her four years, unemployment has fallen sharply, inflation has remained low and the economy is growing.\u201cYou like to make your own mark,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week, by way of explanation.In choosing Mr. Powell, however, Mr. Trump would be resisting pressure by conservatives to make a larger mark on the Fed\u2019s management of the economy. Many conservatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, favored the selection of John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist who has been an outspoken critic of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.Mr. Powell, by contrast, has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012, although he expressed some reservations in internal debates about the extent of those efforts. In recent years, he has backed the methodical unwinding of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign, which involved purchasing $4 trillion worth of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to help the economy recover from the 2008 financial crisis.Fed officials are often labeled hawks if they favor higher interest rates to control inflation, or doves if they want to keep rates low to promote job growth. Richard Fisher, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who worked with Mr. Powell at the Fed, said Mr. Powell \u201cis neither a hawk nor a dove.\u201d\u201cI used to say that we all want to be wise owls,\u201d he added, \u201cand I think that he fits that category very well.\u201dMr. Fisher said Mr. Powell was moderate to a fault. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to get him to drink more than two glasses of wine at dinner, and he will not do it,\u201d he said.A survey of 144 investors conducted by Evercore ISI found that they expected that Mr. Powell would push rates modestly higher than Ms. Yellen over time.Describing an effort already underway at the Fed, he said, \u201cThe whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work.\u201dMr. Powell would require Senate confirmation, and his views, particularly on regulation, could draw opposition from some conservatives in the Senate, 21 of whom voted against his confirmation as a Fed governor in 2014. Two Republicans on the Senate banking committee, which will consider the nomination, had previously raised concerns about Mr. Powell: Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania.If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Powell would be the first Fed chair in four decades without an economics degree. He brings a background in financial markets, a contrast with Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. People who have worked with Mr. Powell say he studied economics assiduously after joining the Fed, gathering stacks of papers on the questions of the day, then reading and discussing the findings with colleagues.\u201cI think it\u2019s far more important to understand and appreciate high-quality economic analysis than it is to have a Ph.D.,\u201d said Kim Schoenholtz, a professor of economics at New York University.He noted that most Treasury secretaries had not held degrees in economics. \u201cWhat distinguishes the most effective secretaries is skill at bringing in talented personnel and appreciation for the value of informed economic analyses,\u201d he said.Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University who worked with Mr. Powell at the Fed, said Mr. Powell had endeavored to understand monetary policy and had demonstrated a strong grasp of the subject. But Mr. Faust said it might be particularly important to have a trained economist as chairman if there was another recession.\u201cIf the economy broadly behaves, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be of great consequence,\u201d Mr. Faust said. \u201cIf we were to face another period where you need innovative and creative leadership, Jay has a lot of skills, and it could still go O.K., but you\u2019d like to add to those skills a lifetime of studying monetary policy.\u201dMr. Powell, 64, is a Washington native who has spent most of his life in a mix of public and private roles. He studied politics at Princeton University, then earned a law degree from Georgetown University before embarking on a career in investment banking in New York.In 1990, he returned to Washington to work for his former boss, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, as under secretary for finance. When Salomon Brothers was caught manipulating the market in Treasuries, Mr. Powell, vacationing on Cape Cod, spent a long August weekend on the phone arranging for top managers to resign and for Warren E. Buffett to be chairman of the company\u2019s board.Mr. Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997 and earned a fortune. His most recent financial disclosure showed a net worth of as much as $55 million. In 2005, he left the firm to focus on fiscal policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center.He attracted the attention of the Obama administration in 2011 for his work behind the scenes to persuade congressional Republicans to raise the debt ceiling. The next year, President Barack Obama nominated Mr. Powell to the Fed alongside a Democrat, the Harvard economist Jeremy Stein, in a package deal that was meant to attract bipartisan support.Mr. Stein returned to his life as a Harvard professor after two years; Mr. Powell decided he liked working at the Fed, and so he stayed.Advertisement"}

He lacks the deep understanding of economics and finance required of his post, but no matter: He has professed his patriotism and has diligently implemented Beijing\u2019s economic policy to \u201cfuse\u201d Hong Kong and the motherland.It is in this climate of Chinese encroachment that the disillusioned youth of Hong Kong, led by university students, are now raising the banner of ultimate resistance: the call for full political independence.But the immediate issue at stake, more basic than independence, is freedom of speech.In 2003, Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong\u2019s leader at the time, tried to enact laws to restrict political freedoms in the name of protecting national security. More than half a million citizens marched against the laws. The proposed legislation would have outlawed \u201cacts\u201d of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against the Central People\u2019s Government. Even that was never intended to ban mere speech.But today simple talk of Hong Kong\u2019s independence is off-limits \u2014 and the first ones to say so are our own university presidents.Yi-Zheng Lian is a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erik Prince, Blackwater Founder, Weighs Primary Challenge to Wyoming Republican", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater, is seriously considering a Republican primary challenge for a Senate seat in Wyoming, potentially adding a high-profile contender to a fledgling drive to oust establishment lawmakers with insurgents in the mold of President Trump.Over the weekend, Mr. Prince traveled to Wyoming with his family to explore ways to establish residency there, said one person who had spoken to him.While his ties to Wyoming are thin, the state is attractive to Mr. Prince because it has none of the personal political entanglements he would face in his home state of Michigan. Public records show that Mr. Prince, a former member of the Navy SEALs who has lived all over the world, had an address in Wapiti, Wyo., in the state\u2019s northwest corner, for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Though Mr. Prince carries baggage, Republicans have privately said that a primary challenge against a lawmaker like Mr. Barrasso is the kind they fear most: an out-of-the-blue run by a renegade from the right against a senator whose sin is not a lack of conservative credentials, but an association with Mr. McConnell and other party leaders.The Prince campaign, if it materializes, would be just the kind of race that Mr. Bannon hopes to replicate across the country. With financing from the Mercers and their network of other conservative donors, Mr. Bannon is looking to build a political coalition that recruits people to run against Republican incumbents from Maine to Montana.He has set his sights most immediately on states like Arizona, Nevada and Mississippi, where he believes a more populist, maverick-style conservative could threaten a sitting Republican senator. But he is also eyeing candidates to run for the Senate in Tennessee, where the retirement of Bob Corker leaves an opening, and in Nebraska, where he believes that Senator Deb Fisher, a first-term Republican, is vulnerable.In meeting with potential candidates, Mr. Bannon has emphasized one credential above all else, people who have spoken with him said. He wants to ensure they will commit to voting against Mr. McConnell for Republican leader.Mr. Prince, 48, has strong ties to the Trump administration. He served as an informal adviser during the transition, and he is the brother of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. He has told his sister that he would like to run against Mr. Barrasso, a person with knowledge of the conversation said.Beyond his support of the use of contractors in war zones, Mr. Prince\u2019s views on political issues are less widely known. He has been described as a libertarian. In 1992, he supported Pat Buchanan\u2019s run for president.Mr. Prince is emblematic of the type of parallel government apparatus that Mr. Bannon built inside the administration during his time as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist. Mr. Bannon, with help from the Mercer family, is now trying to build the same kind of parallel structure inside the Republican Party. And Mr. Prince is not the only candidate on his wish list.Mr. Bannon is expected to throw his support behind Chris McDaniel, a conservative state senator from Mississippi who is considering a primary challenge to United States Senator Roger Wicker, who has served since 2007 and is close to Republican leaders.Mr. Bannon is also hoping to persuade Ann LePage, the wife of Maine\u2019s outspoken governor, Paul LePage, to run for the Republican nomination to challenge Senator Angus King, an independent who is up for re-election in 2018.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Rohingya Crisis Is Changing Bangladesh", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBANGKOK \u2014 Close to one million Rohingya from Myanmar are said to be living in Bangladesh at the moment, nearly half of them having fled since late August. The exodus is one of the world\u2019s worst refugee crises in decades, and so far Bangladesh, already a very poor country, has borne much of the burden.The sudden influx of so many refugees has created a major humanitarian emergency and raises security concerns. There\u2019s also a less-well-understood effect: The Rohingya refugee crisis is shaking Bangladesh\u2019s body politic to the core, and in ways that may hasten the country\u2019s ongoing slide toward authoritarianism.Since the country\u2019s independence in 1971, power has basically shuttled back and forth \u2014 sometimes through elections, sometimes not \u2014 between the nominally secular Awami League, now the ruling party, and the gently pro-Islamic Bangladesh Nationalist Party (B.N.P.). Starting in the early 1990s, as each party increasingly worried that it was losing its edge over the other, both began striking loose alliances with Islamist groups.Such postures make it that much harder for the Bangladeshi government to even consider stemming the influx of refugees. Whether or not Hefazat becomes a formal political party and runs in the next general election, scheduled for late 2018 or early 2019, the Rohingya refugee crisis, which is unfolding on its turf, already is giving it a greater role in national politics.The crisis is also stoking divisions along pro- and anti-India lines within the government and between some government factions and the army. Principally, it is bringing out distrust of India, Ms. Hasina\u2019s main foreign backer, in the Bangladeshi Army and so complicating civilian-military relations in Bangladesh.The ruling Awami League traditionally has had warm ties with India, especially when the Congress party was in power. But India\u2019s current Hindu-nationalist government squarely backs Myanmar. It fears that Muslim refugees entering Bangladesh will find their way to India; in fact, it has already said that it wants to expel the 40,000 or so Rohingya who live there now, some of whom are in its conflict-riven state of Kashmir. The Indian government also needs the Myanmar government\u2019s cooperation to combat insurgents in India\u2019s remote northeastern states, who use Myanmar as a base.And so, much like the B.N.P.\u2019s full-throated support for Rohingya refugees and even Hefazat\u2019s threat of retaliation make it politically hairy for the Hasina government to do anything other than accommodate the exodus, India\u2019s stance \u2014 among other things \u2014 means that the administration must not appear to be too welcoming either.The Awami League slowly seems to be moving away from its original tenets \u2014 secular, pro-India, not overly nationalist, opposed to radical Islamism \u2014 and inching its way closer to positions endorsed by the B.N.P. The shift is problematic because it threatens to further shrink the political space available to minority views and dissenting voices.Partly in response to the Rohingya crisis, which is widening existing political fractures in Bangladesh, Ms. Hasina continues to consolidate power. And liberalism is coming under threat even as extremism could find new fodder.In early September, I went to Shah Porir Dwip, an island at the southern tip of Bangladesh, to report on the refugee crisis. A Rohingya originally from Myanmar who has lived in the area since the early 1990s brought me to the home of a close confidant of Hefazat\u2019s leader. The Hefazat man had just taken in 70 Rohingya, mostly orphaned children, newly arrived from Myanmar.He said nothing to me besides an initial greeting, but the scene alone suggested a troubling possibility: that despair could find meaning in extremism, or that extremism might prey on despair. It also revealed the inroads that Hefazat, once a fringe organization, has made both in this region, where the state is largely absent, and in mainstream national politics.Ms. Hasina faces a near-impossible trilemma: appeasing radical Islamists in Bangladesh while remaining friendly with India even as she tries to satisfy the Bangladeshi Army\u2019s demand for a more aggressive posture toward both Myanmar and India. So far her attempts to strike that balance seem to have undercut the role of secularism and other liberal values in Bangladeshi politics.Many governments, including in the West, are only timidly condemning Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar, for her government\u2019s failure to help the Rohingya. Presumably this is because they worry about scuttling Myanmar\u2019s still-tentative transition toward democracy. But another factor is no less consequential for the stability of the region: Bangladesh\u2019s continued slide toward authoritarianism.Tom Felix Joehnk is The Economist\u2019s correspondent in Bangkok.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Move to Force Trump Team Members to Divulge Industry Ties", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill on Wednesday that would compel top federal officials, including President Trump, to disclose how changes to regulations might benefit them financially.Mr. Trump established the teams at major federal agencies as part of his effort to roll back regulations, presenting industries with a new avenue for bucking rules they have long argued were hurting profits, depressing job creation and raising prices.In addition to the president and members of deregulation teams, the legislation would require disclosures by senior White House advisers, including those who do not receive a government salary, and agency chiefs.The bill\u2019s author, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, was among a group of Democratic lawmakers who demanded in an August letter to the White House that the Trump administration disclose the names deregulation team members and documents related to their potential conflicts of interest. The administration did not respond to the letter.Other sponsors of the bill include Representatives John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva of Arizona, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon.The bill does not have Republican sponsors, which suggests it is unlikely to be approved.An examination of the Trump administration\u2019s deregulation teams has revealed a string of possible conflicts, including some appointees who may be reviewing rules their previous employers tried to weaken or kill.Agencies have been opaque about the deregulation teams. A full vetting of their industry ties has been difficult to conduct because some agencies have declined to provide information about team members, including, in some instances, their names.The teams include former employees of industry-financed organizations that oppose environmental regulations, lawyers who have represented companies in cases against federal regulators and staff members of so-called political dark money groups. In all, The Times and ProPublica identified 85 known current and former team members, including 34 with potential conflicts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Las Vegas Shooting Victims: The Full List", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe night began as a celebration. Thousands gathered in Las Vegas for one last night of song at a long-awaited country music festival. They had driven in from towns all over California. They had flown in from Alaska, Tennessee, West Virginia. They were teachers, police officers, secretaries, retirees.Many had planned for weeks, even months, this weekend of relaxation. Some came with elaborate plans amid the music: a reunion with old friends, a wedding anniversary, even a marriage proposal.The victims included 36 women and 22 men. The oldest was 67, the youngest 20. Here are their stories.Hannah Ahlers, 34 and a mother of three, grew up listening to country music and was a huge fan. She went to the concert on Sunday with her husband, Brian Ahlers, whom she had met in high school. They had been married 17 years, and lived in Beaumont, Calif.Her brother, Lance Miller, confirmed Ms. Ahlers\u2019s death. Her family described her as having \u201cloved life and people.\u201d\u201cShe was our sunshine,\u201d they said in a statement.She was a homemaker, an active member in her children\u2019s schools and community, and was very involved with extracurricular activities, including her daughter\u2019s volleyball team.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t too good for anybody,\u201d Mr. Ahlers said. \u201cBeautiful, inside and out.\u201dHeather Alvarado, a wife and mother of three from Utah, had traveled with her family to attend the concert in Las Vegas.\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the passing of Heather Warino Alvarado, wife of Cedar City firefighter Albert Alvarado,\u201d Sgt. Jerry Womack, a spokesman for the police department in Cedar City, Utah, said in a statement.A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ms. Alvarado\u2019s family described the 35-year-old as a wife, mother, sister, friend and \u201cso much more.\u201d She was \u201calways the first to help out,\u201d the page said, and \u201canyone she comes across she makes them feel like family.\u201dDorene Anderson, 49, of Anchorage loved ice hockey.Or at least she loved the Alaska Aces, a minor league team whose fans were known for ringing cowbells painted with the Aces insignia to show their support during games.He and his family members, Mr. Anderson wrote, are grieving.So are Aces fans, who are holding a candlelight vigil for Ms. Anderson on Tuesday at the Sullivan Arena, where the Aces (who are moving to Maine) have played. \u201cWe ask you wear an Aces jersey, cowbell crew shirt, or anything cowboys-related,\u201d read a post on the fan page. \u201cBring your cowbell.\u201dWith a small inheritance from her grandparents, whom she had helped care for during long illnesses, Carrie Barnette, 34, last year bought a home in Riverside, Calif. It was a personal milestone for the Disney food service employee.A music festival aficionado of sorts, she had posted video of parts of this country music concert to Facebook, and noted that she was having more fun in Las Vegas than she had at Stagecoach, a California festival.\u201cThat was Carrie,\u201d a cousin, Janice Chambers, said. \u201cShe just liked to go out and do things.\u201dMs. Barnette worked as a cook at the Pacific Wharf Cafe, a waterfront restaurant at a Disney park in Anaheim, and was the proud owner of a basset hound, Lucy.In the last photo that Jack Beaton posted on his Facebook page on Sunday evening, his companions can be seen lounging on the grass, holding beers and smiling at the camera, lights from the country music festival twinkling in the background.\u201cDay Three Route 91 Vegas!\u201d he wrote in the caption.Hours later, Mr. Beaton, of Bakersfield, Calif., was killed while shielding his wife, Laurie, from gunfire, his family said.His father-in-law, Jerry Cook, told BakersfieldNow.com that Mr. Beaton had covered his wife\u2019s body with his own, and was shot. \u201cHe told her he loved her,\u201d he said. \u201cLaurie could tell he was slipping. She told him she loved him and she would see him in heaven.\u201dMr. Beaton, 54, was gregarious and always helping other people; a family man who adored driving his truck with his hat on sideways, Mr. Cook said.Mr. Beaton\u2019s son, Jake, paid tribute to his father on Facebook. \u201cLost my best friend,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI love you so much more than you could ever imagine. Please watch over our family. You will forever be remembered as our hero!\u201dWhatever Steve Berger did, he always seemed to be at the top of his game.\u201cI said, \u2018Steve, be careful,\u2019\u201d his father recalled.On Sunday night, Candice Bowers, 40, was taking a rare weekend away from her home and responsibilities in Orange County, Calif., listening to music with a friend at the Jason Aldean concert.\u201cCandice left this world doing what she loved, dancing to country music among loved ones,\u201d a GoFundMe page begun for her children said. \u201cShe will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.\u201dWhenever Tony Burditus was away from Denise Salmon Burditus, his wife of 32 years, she sent him selfies, nearly always featuring one of her big, broad smiles.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t get it, I would text her back and she would send me one back with a smile.\u201dAs the shooting began, Mr. Burditus said the couple mistook the sound as pyrotechnics. \u201cWe stood there for a second and she asked me if it was gunfire and I told her, \u2018No.\u2019 And then it was during the second burst that we knew,\u201d Mr. Burditus said. They tried to get away.\u201cI was leading her through the crowd,\u201d he said. But she was shot, and Mr. Burditus said he \u201cimmediately knew her wound was fatal. She was unconscious from the time she was struck.\u201d Ms. Burditus was 50.Over the course of a carefree weekend in Las Vegas, they kept bumping into one another around the festival: at least a half dozen teachers, principals and school psychologists who worked for the Manhattan Beach School District in Southern California, taking a brief escape from their responsibilities to listen to live music.The school district said on Monday that Sandy Casey, 34, a special-education teacher originally from Vermont, was killed in the shooting. The other staff members from the district were physically unharmed.Ms. Casey taught middle school and had worked for the district for nine years, an energetic person who delighted in her students, the superintendent, Mike Matthews, said.\u201cShe was a person who brings light wherever she is,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a classroom full of light and hope and caring.\u201dMs. Casey\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Chris Willemse, an instructional assistant for the district, was with Ms. Casey in Las Vegas. He wrote on Facebook: \u201cAs I sit and mourn such a beautiful life gone too fast, all I can say is look up and watch the birds fly high and free today, as that\u2019s where I feel you smiling down upon all of us. I love you baby girl! Love you to pieces!\u201dIt seemed like the Route 91 Harvest Festival would be the perfect place for Andrea Castilla, a sales associate at Sephora in Huntington Beach, Calif., to celebrate her 28th birthday. Her sister, Athena, would be there with her fianc\u00e9, and Andrea and her boyfriend, Derek Miller, decided to join them.He never had the chance. Ms. Castilla was killed in the attack, according to a text message from her aunt, Marina Castilla Parker, who posted photos to Facebook of Ms. Castilla beaming at the festival with her sister and their partners.In an interview with People, Athena Castilla said she and her fianc\u00e9 tried to keep Ms. Castilla from being stepped on after she fell. Athena said that strangers had helped put Andrea into the back of a truck for the drive to the hospital.\u201cI was holding onto her head and trying to keep her from losing so much blood, talking to her, kissing her, telling her she was going to make it,\u201d Athena Castilla said. \u201cWe all did our best to help her get through it. We did the best we could.\u201dDenise Cohen was never bored, or boring. Ms. Cohen, 58, was the \u201clife of the party,\u201d her younger sister, Kristal Vogel, said: \u201cthe first one to be out and the last one to go to bed.\u201dShe loved to be outdoors, whether on a beach or at a festival like Route 91, which she attended with her boyfriend, Derrick Taylor, who also died. She was particularly excited to see Jason Aldean, whom Ms. Vogel had seen live a few days before. \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t wait to see Jason Aldean\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s all I heard all weekend,\u201d Ms. Vogel said.Ms. Cohen had two sons, both in their 30s, and lived in Carpinteria, Calif., near Santa Barbara. She had recently started working for Team HOA, a division of McFarland Financial that focused on homeowner association accounting.Austin Davis, 29, a pipe fitter from Riverside, Calif., made the trip to Las Vegas with Thomas Day Jr., a softball buddy who also died.The two played \u201cfast-pitch softball\u201d together, Berta Garcia, the coed director for USA Softball of Southern California, told The Riverside Press-Enterprise. \u201cTom kind of guided him.\u201dAfter the shooting, Mr. Davis\u2019 girlfriend, Aubree Hennigan, had posted urgent pleas for help on social media as she and his parents sought news of his whereabouts. Before receiving confirmation of his death, she wrote on Facebook: \u201cMy everything \u2026 Please come home to us.\u201dA \u201cHomerun Derby\u201d was being planned, in honor of Mr. Davis and Mr. Day. \u201cI will be there for my man and I would love to see everyone,\u201d Ms. Hennigan wrote.Thomas Day Jr., 54, was a contractor who worked in a branch of his father\u2019s home-building business in Corona, Calif. He had traveled to Las Vegas to attend the concert with three of his grown children and a group of friends.His father, Thomas Day Sr., said he received a call from his grandson late on Sunday: The three adult children and the friends were in hiding, the grandson said, but Mr. Day had been shot in the head.The elder Mr. Day, who lives in Las Vegas, said his son, who was divorced, was a \u201cgreat dad\u201d who often attended concerts with his children.He had not been able to see the body or bury his son. \u201cThey still have him,\u201d he said.Christiana Duarte, 22, had a gorgeous singing voice. And she was much like her parents, a family friend, Danette Meyers, said. \u201cShe was very giving,\u201d Ms. Meyers said.Ms. Duarte had gone to the country music festival with her brother\u2019s girlfriend, Ariel Romero. Both women were shot, Ms. Meyers said. Ms. Romero had been through surgery and was expected to recover, Ms. Meyers said.Ms. Duarte\u2019s father, Michael, is a longtime employee of the Los Angeles prosecutor\u2019s office, where he has regularly consoled the victims of crimes and their families, she said. Now his own family was wrestling with loss.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how this has hit all of us,\u201d Ms. Meyers said. \u201cThis is just unbelievable. This senseless, violent act is just killing us all.\u201dAfter the first round of shots, Stacee Etcheber\u2019s husband, Vincent, told her to run, he told family members. An off-duty officer with the San Francisco Police Department, he stayed behind to try to help.Then the second round came.Mr. Etcheber\u2019s father, Jean, who was babysitting the couple\u2019s two children, 10 and 12, at their Novato, Calif., home, said the family was given confirmation of Ms. Etcheber\u2019s death on Monday night.Ms. Etcheber, 50, was a hairdresser whose Facebook profile picture shows her working on her beach handstand next to her daughter.\u201cPlease pray for our family during this difficult time,\u201d Ms. Etcheber\u2019s brother-in-law, Al Etcheber, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday morning.Brian Fraser, 39, was in his element at the Jason Aldean concert on Sunday night, his family said. He had just moved closer to the stage in the hopes that his favorite song, \u201cDirt Road Anthem,\u201d was coming soon.Moments later, he was fatally shot. His companions \u2014 his wife, Stephanie, and other family members and friends \u2014 survived.\u201cA bigger-than-life man taken far too soon,\u201d his sisters-in-law wrote on a GoFundMe page. \u201cBrian was a rock of love and support to his family.\u201dA vice president of sales for Greenpath, a mortgage firm, Mr. Fraser lived in La Palma, Calif., and graduated from California Polytechnic State University.\u201cBrian Fraser impacted everyone who crossed his path with his infectious positive energy, his tenacious will to succeed, and his willingness to help others,\u201d his employer said in a statement.Keri Galvan, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., had three children, and they were her world. On her Instagram page, she called herself a \u201csuper tired super mama of 3.\u201d On Facebook, she posted a photograph of herself standing next to a new Lexus S.U.V., and wrote: \u201cNew baby to accommodate allllllllll the babies.\u201d\u201cThey always went to Disneyland together,\u201d Isaac Galvan, her father-in-law, said. \u201cShe was just a great mother.\u201dMs. Galvan, 31, who had worked for a decade as a server at Mastro\u2019s Steakhouse in Thousand Oaks, attended the music festival in Las Vegas with her husband, Justin Galvan, and some of their friends.\u201cHer days started and ended with doing everything in her power to be a wonderful mother,\u201d Ms. Poole said.Dana Gardner, the deputy recorder of San Bernardino County, Calif., began working for the county 26 years ago as a document clerk, a county spokesman, David Wert, said in an email. Ms. Gardner, 52, was \u201cknown for her \u2018can-do\u2019 attitude and vibrant energy,\u201d Bob Dutton, the county\u2019s assessor, recorder and clerk, wrote on Facebook.In a Facebook message, Kayla Gardner, Dana Gardner\u2019s daughter, said: \u201cShe spent our whole childhood making sacrifices and doing anything and everything she could for us.\u201dShe added later, \u201cAs we got older and became adults, for the first time in her life she stopped worrying about taking care of us and started to take care of herself. She started traveling, spending time with her friends, and enjoying her life the way she wanted. As her children, it was so enjoyable to see her so vibrant and full of life, and that is how we will always remember her.\u201dMs. Gomez, a nursing student from Riverside, Calif. who was known as Angie, was in Las Vegas with her boyfriend when the shooting began.Rocio Guillen and her fianc\u00e9, Christopher Jaksha, left their two children with Mr. Jaksha\u2019s parents for some rare time alone: a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend\u2019s birthday.Each night they were away, they made video calls to say good night, blowing kisses at Sophia, 17 months, and Austin, who was born in August, said Mr. Jaksha\u2019s mother, Donna.\u201cWe Facetimed all weekend,\u201d Ms. Jaksha said. \u201cWe would say \u2018Look, it\u2019s mommy and daddy. Look at the cowboy hats.\u2019\u201dMs. Guillen, 40, was shot in the thigh as she ran from the shooting with Mr. Jaksha. She was placed in a police car, and an officer applied a tourniquet, but she did not survive.The couple met when they worked at a Chili\u2019s restaurant as managers. They shared a home in Eastvale, Calif., and both worked at California Pizza Kitchen restaurants nearby as they planned for their wedding. Ms. Guillen has two sons from a previous marriage, according to Ms. Jaksha. \u201cI already considered her to be my daughter-in-law,\u201d Ms. Jaksha said.\u201cEvery time you talked to him, your life would be better,\u201d Stan King, a friend whose son played football on a team, the Henderson Cowboys, that Officer Hartfield had coached. \u201cYou wished you were 10 percent of what that guy was.\u201dOfficer Hartfield, who had served on the police force for 11 years, was memorialized in a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds.Fellow officers and friends remembered the man they called Charlie or Coach Chucky, or even, occasionally, \u201cCaptain America\u201d as knowledgeable and experienced, a patriot and a wit.\u201cI know that none of us here really planned on saying goodbye to Charlie so soon, but I\u2019m glad we get to send him off in our way, not somebody else\u2019s way,\u201d said Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association.Chris Hazencomb, 44, of Camarillo, Calif., had a modest birthday celebration with his mother, Maryanne Hazencomb, 69, last Wednesday. They ran errands, picked up fried chicken, and, as they did every Wednesday, watched an episode of \u201cThe Little Couple\u201d that Mr. Hazencomb had recorded the previous day.The mother and son had always lived together, and worked in tandem to care for Mr. Hazencomb\u2019s father, who was ill for a decade before he died. Mr. Hazencomb had something to look forward to, as well: The Route 91 Harvest music festival, which he was attending with his best friend\u2019s wife. (The best friend, it turned out, hated country music.)Ms. Hazencomb got the news Sunday night. Mr. Hazencomb had been shot in the head. Ms. Hazencomb rushed to Sunrise Hospital, in Las Vegas, leaving Camarillo at 3 a.m. Mr. Hazencomb was on a ventilator, Ms. Hazencomb said, and officials told her he would not survive.\u201cHe looked like he was sleeping,\u201d Ms. Hazencomb said. Members of her extended family gathered in the hospital room. After getting last rites from the Catholic Church, he was taken off life support.Ms. Hazencomb said her son had died shielding his best friend\u2019s wife from bullets. \u201cHe\u2019d give you the shirt off his back,\u201d Ms. Hazencomb said.Jennifer Irvine, 42, built her own legal practice in San Diego, specializing in family law. But there was also time for hobbies like snowboarding and Taekwondo \u2014 and for her friends and country music.\u201cShe did go to a lot of concerts,\u201d Jason Irvine, Jennifer\u2019s brother, said, as he waited at the Las Vegas Convention Center to pick up her belongings.Ms. Irvine had attended the festival in Las Vegas with a group of girlfriends, some of whom had posted pictures of their group, wearing jean shorts and cowboy boots, grinning in front of the festival banner.\u201cShe was there with three other friends who were able to leave when it started, but unfortunately Jennifer was not one of those who was able to leave,\u201d Mr. Irvine said.Nicol Kimura, 38, of Placentia, Calif., was part of a close-knit group of 16 friends who always spent time together, said Ryan Miller, one of the people in the group. To the children of those friends, Ms. Kimura was simply Auntie Nicol, he said \u2014 a playmate who was eager to host tea parties, color with them and craft.\u201cJust a beaming light,\u201d Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview.Seven of the friends went to the concert in Las Vegas; they had already been to several other concerts this year, but they were especially excited to attend the weekend\u2019s Route 91 Harvest Festival, Mr. Miller said.The group of friends was together when shots first rang out, Mr. Miller said. Soon, everyone had hit the ground.As the gunfire continued, another friend, about 20 feet away, yelled out that Ms. Kimura had been hurt; she was bleeding from her side.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t pull her to safety,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Late Sunday afternoon, Carly Kreibaum\u2019s Facebook page showed the smiling proof of a girls\u2019 weekend in full swing: a picture of Ms. Kreibaum with two friends at the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 a cafe, canal and gondolas in the background.At the concert that evening, Ms. Kreibaum, 33, a mother of two from Sutherland, Iowa, was fatally shot, a family member said. Her friends survived.Back in northwest Iowa, her small community of 600 has been in mourning for Ms. Kreibaum, who studied art education at Wayne State College in Nebraska and worked at Walmart.On Facebook on Tuesday, Mr. Kreibaum thanked family and friends for their support, saying he was en route to Las Vegas. A local church set up a fund for donations for the Kreibaum family, and on Wednesday evening, it opened up the church, inviting those who wanted to talk, pray or deal with their grief.When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Rhonda LeRocque flew down with other members of her church to help the victims.\u201cFor more than 10 years she cared for her work family at IDEO Cambridge with the same warmth, love and devotion she showed everyone in her life,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cNobody helped us build community quite like Rhonda.\u201dWhen Victor Link, of Orange County, Calif., was struck by gunfire, he had his own rescue crew right beside him.\u201cRob, his best friend, who is a firefighter and a paramedic, picked my son up and carried him to a safer place and tried to resuscitate him,\u201d Mr. Link\u2019s father, Loyd, said on Tuesday. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen.\u201dMr. Link, 55, worked in the financial services industry and lived with his partner, Lynne Gonzales. He had a son, Christian, from a previous marriage, his father said.\u201cMy son took a bullet to the chest,\u201d he said.\u201cWe only had one child,\u201d they told CBC News. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dThere were two Ms. Meadows who were well known in the halls of Taft Union High School in Taft, Calif.: Stacy, who has worked at the school for 35 years, and Kelsey, her daughter, a substitute teacher.Kelsey Meadows, who was 28, was killed in the shooting, leaving behind her parents, brother and sister-in-law, \u201calong with an entire community that loved and respected her,\u201d the school said in a statement.The younger Ms. Meadows graduated from Taft Union High School in 2007 and returned in 2012 to work there as a teacher \u2014 alongside her mother, who worked in information technology. \u201cKelsey was smart, compassionate and kind,\u201d Mary Alice Finn, the principal, said in an email. \u201cShe had a sweet spirit and a love for children.\u201dBrad Meadows, her brother, informed friends of her death on Facebook \u201cwith an absolutely shattered heart,\u201d he wrote.Calla Medig could not stop chattering to her co-workers at Moxie\u2019s Grill and Bar, a restaurant in Edmonton, Alberta, where she was a bartender and server, about her upcoming trip to Las Vegas.\u201cI even gave her a hard time because I don\u2019t like country music,\u201d said her boss, Scott Collingwood. \u201cI told her, \u2018You\u2019re going to be out there two-stepping. And she said, \u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with two-stepping!\u2019\u201dMs. Medig, 28, was a warm and funny presence in the restaurant, where she had worked for two years.She was so dependable and levelheaded that when Mr. Collingwood couldn\u2019t reach her by phone, text or Facebook in the aftermath of the shooting on Sunday night, he immediately feared the worst.\u201cCalla is super responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cI just knew.\u201dMs. Medig was scheduled to fly back home on Wednesday. Thursday was important to her. It was to have been her first day at the restaurant after being promoted to manager.When Sonny Melton and his wife, Heather Gulish Melton, heard the sound of gunshots in Las Vegas on Sunday night, he grabbed her and began to run.\u201cI felt him get shot in the back,\u201d Ms. Gulish Melton told WCYB, a television station in northeast Tennessee. \u201cI want everyone to know what a kindhearted, loving man he was, but at this point, I can barely breathe.\u201dMr. Melton, 29, was described in Facebook tributes as a kind spirit, a registered nurse who worked for much of 2016 in the surgical unit at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital in Jackson, Tenn.\u201cHe was a very kind, compassionate, genuine person who lived life to the fullest, and he took great care of our patients,\u201d said Amy Garner, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Union University, a college in Jackson, Tenn., said Mr. Melton was a 2015 graduate of the school and worked in the emergency department at Henry County Medical Center.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Melton and his wife had been married only a year and had traveled from Tennessee for the music festival.\u201cWhen the bullets began raining down from above, Sonny shielded her from danger, selflessly giving up his life to save hers,\u201d Ms. Sanders said on Monday.Not long before the shooting began, Pati Mestas posted a video on Facebook. It showed her jumping up and down in front of the stage at the Route 91 festival, having made her way up to the front of the crowd.\u201cThat was the type of person she was,\u201d her cousin Tom Smith said. \u201cIf you could do it and if it wasn\u2019t wrong, she would do it.\u201dMs. Mestas, 67, was partly retired from her job as a deli manager at a Shell convenience store in Corona, Calif., and was spending all the time she could with her three children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild, Mr. Smith said. He saw her in March, he recalled, and she had never seemed so happy.\u201cWhen she did something, she did it 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cShe was faithful to her family, to her friends, a very strong Christian, and she couldn\u2019t get enough out of life.\u201dAustin Meyer, 24, hoped to own an auto repair shop, his sister, Veronica Meyer, told KSBW, a television news station in Monterey, Calif.Mr. Meyer had recently moved from his home near Monterey to Reno, Nev. to earn a degree in transportation technologies at Truckee Meadows Community College.\u201cHe was a wonderful young man and my future son-in-law,\u201d Ms. Getreu\u2019s father, Gary Getreu, said in a statement released by the college. \u201cThe loss and grief his family and mine feel at this time is beyond belief.\u201dAdrian Murfitt, 35, had been working 16-hour days all summer as a commercial salmon fisherman in his home state of Alaska. It was time for a break.He gathered up two of his childhood friends and booked tickets for a country music festival, just as he had done last year, according to his sister, Shannon Gothard.\u201cHe had such a great time when he went before, and he wanted to treat himself for a successful fishing season,\u201d Ms. Gothard said from Anchorage.Mr. Murfitt was an Alaskan to the core. Since he was a toddler, he loved playing hockey, she said; he could fix almost anything mechanical; he was devoted to his dog, Paxson, a Western Siberian Laika.Ms. Gothard said the family had pieced together her brother\u2019s last minutes from Brian MacKinnon, a friend who was with him at the concert on Sunday night. \u201cHe was just having a good time, enjoying himself and got shot in the neck,\u201d she said of her brother. A woman standing next to Mr. Murfitt was shot in the head, Mr. MacKinnon told the family. He watched as medics tried to resuscitate Mr. Murfitt, though the medics told Mr. MacKinnon to leave the scene for his own safety.\u201cSadly, he died in my arms,\u201d Mr. MacKinnon wrote on Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what else to say at this time. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dShe was 33 and had worked at the department for 10 years.As children growing up in California, they were always together, so close that their names seemed to run together into one: Jenny-and-Bobby.\u201cShe said, \u2018I am going to marry Bobby,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Parks\u2019s aunt, Rhonda Boyle. \u201cI guess she always had a little crush on him.\u201dThey became high school sweethearts and later married. And they were together on Sunday night in Las Vegas, when Ms. Parks, 36, was fatally shot while attending the concert with her husband, Bobby Parks. Mr. Parks was wounded in the arm and a finger, her family said.The Westside Union School District, where she worked, said Ms. Parks \u201cwill be remembered for her sense of humor, her passion for her work, her devotion to her students, and her commitment to continuing her own learning and to taking on whatever new projects came her way.\u201dMs. Parks was a mother of two, a kindergarten teacher and a volleyball coach in Lancaster, Calif.\u201cShe had a heart of gold,\u201d Ms. Boyle said.Ms. Parsons had posted photographs on social media and wrote \u201cNight made,\u201d after the performance of Eric Church, her favorite country music artist, KOMO reported.Lisa Patterson was determined that her three children, now 19, 17 and 8, would grow up to be fearless.She pushed them to take part in school plays so that they would be confident taking risks. She drove them to softball practice so that they would learn teamwork. She made sure they performed community service, while juggling her own volunteer work and helping to run her husband\u2019s small hardwood flooring business, without the aid of a housekeeper or nanny.The trip to Las Vegas, with a group of mom friends from her church, was a departure for Ms. Patterson, 46, of Lomita, Calif., who was typically too occupied to take time out for herself. But her love of all types of music was well known to her friends and family, who would often be induced to sing with her in the car, loud enough to provoke looks from others sitting in traffic nearby.The children, said her close friend, Deborah Beckman, learned to simply smile back.\u201cShe has brought them up to really stand on their two feet,\u201d Ms. Beckman said. \u201cAnd I thank God because I think that will help them to be able to deal with it.\u201dWhen the gunfire began on Sunday night, John Phippen, and his son, Travis, followed the same urgent instinct: to try to save people.Then John Phippen was shot.\u201cI got over there as fast as I could and I put my arm around him,\u201d Travis Phippen said.With the help of a bystander, they got John Phippen away from the area, but he did not survive.\u201cHe told me that he loved me and he wanted everybody to know how much he loved them,\u201d the younger Mr. Phippen said.Melissa Ramirez, 26, grew up in California\u2019s Antelope Valley amid a big and close-knit extended family that she often visited on weekends when she attended college, at California State University, Bakersfield.Her love of country music drew her to the festival in Las Vegas, her cousin, Fabiola Farnetti, said on Tuesday. When the two were in high school, they spent summers working alongside Ms. Ramirez\u2019s parents selling fruit and vegetables for a local farm company at flea markets in the area.The daughter of Mexican immigrants who became United States citizens, Ms. Ramirez majored in business and had recently received a promotion at the car insurance company where she worked, her cousin said.\u201cShe always helped her parents, and just wanted to be there,\u201d Ms. Farnetti said.The family had held out hope that she had survived the shooting, but her father identified her remains at the Las Vegas morgue early on Tuesday.On her Instagram account, she posted photographs of her dog, a boxer, her young niece and, most recently, from her trip to Las Vegas.Jordyn Rivera, 21, a health care management student at California State University, San Bernardino, spent part of last summer in London for the school\u2019s study abroad program.\u201cWe will remember and treasure her for her warmth, optimism, energy and kindness,\u201d the university\u2019s president, Tomas Morales, wrote in an email on Tuesday to employees and students.Ms. Rivera, of La Verne, Calif., had traveled to the concert with her mother, a friend told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.She would have graduated next year.An aunt of Quinton Robbins, 20, who worked as a recreation assistant for the city of Henderson, Nev., wrote on Facebook that her nephew was among the dead.\u201cI can\u2019t say enough good about this sweet soul,\u201d the aunt, Kilee Wells Sanders, wrote of Mr. Robbins. \u201cEveryone who met him loved him. His contagious laugh and smile.\u201dOutside of his job with the city of Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, Mr. Robbins coached flag football for 5-year-olds, his brother\u2019s flag football team and softball teams. He also coached basketball along with his uncle at a high school, and was finishing certification to be a full-time coach for the Clark County School District.Mr. Robbins had been thrilled to score tickets to the music festival. \u201cHe was a big country music fan and he and his girlfriend were excited to go,\u201d said James DiNicola, Mr. Robbins\u2019s friend and colleague at the Henderson recreational department. \u201cIt was a last-minute thing.\u201dCameron Robinson, 28, had taken Monday off from his job as a management analyst for the city of Las Vegas to attend the country music festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley.The creator of a smartphone app that eased navigation for attendees of the city government\u2019s annual conferences, Mr. Robinson was a frequent volunteer at city events, and had been given a promotion last summer, according to Brad Jerbic, the city attorney for Las Vegas and a family friend.\u201cHe was driven, but not so driven that he didn\u2019t know how to enjoy life,\u201d Mr. Jerbic said.Mr. Robinson was shot in the neck, Mr. Jerbic said. He died shortly after 10 p.m. Sunday night, in Mr. Eardley\u2019s arms.Tara Roe Smith, 34, of Alberta, an educational assistant, was separated from her husband during the attack, according to The Edmonton Journal.\u201cTara was an aide in my granddaughter\u2019s preschool class,\u201d wrote Viola Anderson, a resident of Okotoks, where Ms. Roe Smith lived, on a GoFundMe page set up by a friend. \u201cShe will be missed.\u201dThe mother of two young sons, she grew up in Manitoba, where the community is \u201cheartbroken,\u201d a family friend told CTV Manitoba.\u201cIt is with sadness, shock, and grief that we confirm the loss of a Foothills School Division staff member,\u201d John Bailey, superintendent of the school district where Ms. Roe Smith worked, wrote in a statement posted on the district\u2019s website. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected by this unimaginable attack.\u201dLast year, Lisa Romero-Muniz\u2019s husband, Chris, forgot their wedding anniversary. This year he was determined to make it up to her.So he made a grand gesture, planning a four-day weekend in Las Vegas and buying tickets to see her favorite country singer, Jason Aldean. Mr. Muniz, who worked long hours at a refinery, and Ms. Romero-Muniz, 48 and a high school secretary in Gallup, N.M., left on Thursday for Las Vegas, more than a six-hour drive away.\u201cShe was beyond excited,\u201d said Rosie Fernandez, her friend and supervisor at the high school where they worked. \u201cFor her husband to remember her anniversary and do all of that, this was a big thing for her.\u201dMs. Romero-Muniz\u2019s death, confirmed by officials at the school where she worked, left her colleagues and community shaken, her co-workers said.Born and raised in the small city of Gallup, she was a mother of three grown children and a secretary at Miyamura High School, where she was responsible for disciplining students who got into trouble. Ms. Romero-Muniz had a warm personality and a big laugh, always teasing her co-workers, Ms. Fernandez said.\u201cWe were known as the two loudmouths of the office,\u201d Ms. Fernandez said. \u201cShe knew 90 percent of the kids at this school. She would talk to them like she was talking to her own children. I\u2019d hear her saying, \u2018I know you can do better than this.\u2019\u201dOn Monday morning, administrators put up posters around the school so that students could write on them how they were feeling. A candlelight memorial is planned for Monday evening.Christopher Roybal went to the concert with his mother, Debby Allen, to celebrate his 29th birthday.\u201cI just kept saying, \u2018My son, my son, where is my son?\u2019\u201d Ms. Allen said. \u201cThis guy wouldn\u2019t let me go back in. He goes: \u2018You have to run away from the gunfire, not towards the gunfire.\u2019\u201dHe was a Navy veteran who had served stints in Afghanistan. In a Facebook post in July, he had recalled the emotions of battle: \u201cThe anger stays, long after your friends have died, the lives you\u2019ve taken are buried and your boots are placed neatly in a box in some storage unit.\u201dGrowing up in Arizona with five siblings, Brett Schwanbeck, 61, was a brother who loved to joke around and have fun. He had the most beautiful smile ever, his sister, Robin Martin, said. \u201cHe was very, very full of life,\u201d she said.Mr. Schwanbeck, a retired truck driver who lived in Bullhead City, Ariz., had met Ms. Orozco in high school in Ash Fork. Their romance blossomed much later.Ms. Martin said she tried to speak to her brother after the shooting while he was on life support in the hospital, hoping that he could hear her.\u201cFamily meant everything to him,\u201d she said.At Infinity Communications and Consulting, the Bakersfield, Calif., company where Bailey Schweitzer worked as a receptionist, Ms. Schweitzer \u201cwas always the ray of sunshine in our office on a cloudy day,\u201d Fred Brakeman, the company\u2019s president, said. \u201cNo one could possibly have a bad day when Bailey was around. If you have ever called or visited our office, she was the perky one that helped direct you to the staff member you needed.\u201dThe staff at the Chili\u2019s restaurant in Arroyo Market Square in Las Vegas knew it was Friday when Laura Shipp, 50, took her seat by the bar and ordered her favorites: Smoked wings and a Presidente Margarita.\u201cLike clockwork she would be there Friday night, first seat at the bar,\u201d said Chris Atkinson, a manager at the restaurant, over a Facebook message.The wings were not the only draw. Ms. Shipp\u2019s son, Corey, 23, a marine reservist, was a bartender and server there, and she liked to be around him. She was so well-liked, Mr. Atkinson said, that he and Corey\u2019s other friends took to calling her \u201cMama Shipp.\u201d And Corey Shipp liked having her around.\u201cThese two seemed like, even if they weren\u2019t family, they would still be best friends,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said.Corey Shipp moved to Las Vegas first, and Laura Shipp followed. \u201cCorey was her only and Laura was his only,\u201d said Steve Shipp, 47, Ms. Shipp\u2019s brother, who confirmed her death.They loved the Dodgers and country music, which is what brought them to the festival. Corey Shipp was not harmed, but he could not find his mother despite a frantic search that involved many members of the Chili\u2019s staff.\u201cIt took about 28, to 30 hours, just even to figure out that she had passed,\u201d Mr. Shipp, the brother, said.The security staff working at the Route 91 festival were the first to help, and Erick Silva, 21, of Las Vegas was one of them. Mr. Silva, who was assigned to a position near the front of the stage, began trying to help audience members escape over a barricade.As he worked to usher others away, he was shot, and was later pronounced dead in the hospital, Jay Purves, the Nevada vice president of Mr. Silva\u2019s employer, Contemporary Services Corp., said in an email.Two other C.S.C. employees were also shot, but they survived, Mr. Purves said. \u201cWatching the many video clips on YouTube and social media, you see our men and women in the yellow shirts jumping right into the middle of the chaos as it started to help those who were shot.\u201d\u201cHe never complained about anything.\u201dThe company will name one of its training centers after Mr. Silva, Mr. Purves said.Susan Smith, 53, was a lover of country music, a devoted mother to a son and daughter, a wife and a popular office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley, Calif.\u201cA wonderful person,\u201d said her father, Tom Rementer, through tears.She had gone to Las Vegas with friends. They survived the shooting.A year ago, Brennan Stewart posted on Facebook a video of himself performing the country song \u201cYou Should Be Here.\u201d It has gone viral in recent days. Grieving families and friends \u2014 and not just his \u2014 have seen it as a touchstone after the Route 91 shooting.In his original post on Oct. 4, 2016, Mr. Stewart wrote that he had taken a \u201cslower approach\u201d to the song, written by the musician Cole Swindell in 2015 after the death of his father. \u201cThoughts on this one!?\u201d Mr. Stewart asked.\u201cSolid performance. Rest in peace, Brennan,\u201d read one of dozens of recent replie+s on the old thread.A tribute to the love of country music that propelled Mr. Stewart, 30, of Las Vegas, and so many others to the music festival, the video has been shared over a thousand times.\u201cYou should be here.\u201dA California corrections officer in charge of inmates who volunteer to fight forest fires, Derrick Taylor, 56, of Oxnard, Calif., had been stationed in the northern tip of the state last month, where a fire had been burning for weeks.He made it home just in time to leave for the trip he had planned with his girlfriend, Denise Cohen, to attend the music festival in Las Vegas. The couple both died in the attack. In his job and in his personal relationships, Mr. Taylor, his younger son Kyle, 31, said, was kind, generous \u2014 and honest.When he was in college, the younger Mr. Taylor recalled, his father sometimes called to make sure he was in class. He also insisted that his grandchildren leave video games behind while he escorted them to the park or on hikes. Friends the younger Mr. Taylor had not heard from since high school contacted him after hearing about his father\u2019s death. They remembered him as a kind of \u201csecond dad.\u201d\u201cHe was someone who cares enough to hold you accountable,\u201d Mr. Taylor said, \u201cfor who you could be and who you should be.\u201dNeysa Tonks, 46 and a mother of three from Las Vegas, had brought \u201cso much joy, fun and laughter\u201d to her workplace, according to her employer, Technologent.Michelle Vo was one of those people who didn\u2019t waste time.In the last few months, she was a whirlwind of new hobbies \u2014 paddle boarding, golf, even surfing, said a close friend, Casey Lubin. She had already been all over Europe and Southeast Asia. Next on her list was Iceland \u2014 she was determined to travel there by herself.Ms. Vo and Ms. Lubin had met through a mutual friend. \u201cHe was like, \u2018You have to meet this girl, the two of you are meant to be friends,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lubin said. \u201cShe\u2019s like a shark. She\u2019s a go-getter. She\u2019s so inspiring.\u201dMs. Vo, 32 and an insurance agent from Los Angeles, was by herself at the concert on Sunday when she befriended a stranger, Kody Robertson, of Ohio. Ms. Vo was standing next to Mr. Robertson when she was shot.Mr. Von Tillow had traveled to Las Vegas for the concert with family members. His wife and daughter escaped unharmed, Mr. Carson said. Mr. Von Tillow\u2019s sister was shot in the thigh and his niece in an ankle. Both were expected to recover.Mr. Von Tillow\u2019s wife told family members she was herded out of the area by the authorities amid the chaos of the shooting scene, Mr. Carson said. \u201cThat was probably the hardest part for her \u2014 having to leave him there,\u201d he said.On Monday, friends and family gathered at the Cameron Park Country Club, where Mr. Von Tillow was a member. At his home, family members set up a memorial with an American flag, and played the national anthem.\u201cGuarantee you, he\u2019s covered in red, white and blue right now, with a Coors Light in his hand, smiling with his family and listening to some music,\u201d Mr. Carson told the television station.Bill Wolfe Jr., a wrestling and Little League coach in Shippensburg, Pa., went to Las Vegas with his wife, Robyn, to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Only Robyn came home.Mr. Wolfe, 42 and a coach at Shippensburg Greyhound Wrestling, was also an employee of the engineering consulting firm Dewberry and a former president of the Shippensburg Wrestling Booster Club.Julie Bosman reported from Chicago; Amy Harmon, Christine Hauser and Maggie Astor from New York; and Jess Bidgood from Boston.

Without DVD sales as a safety net \u2014 and with greater competition for leisure time from television \u2014 Hollywood has veered sharply away from the risky middle, pursuing either small-scale films designed for niche audiences (horror fans, for instance) or big-budget franchise movies aimed at every man, woman and teenager worldwide.Cross Creek hit pay dirt with its first effort, a small-scale film: \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d which cost $13 million to make and took in about $330 million worldwide. But when the company has tried to tackle mid-tier movies (\u201cBlack Mass,\u201d starring Johnny Depp and costing $53 million, for instance), the results have largely been disappointing.Tyler Thompson, who served as a producer on \u201cAmerican Made,\u201d declined an interview request.Universal distributed \u201cAmerican Made\u201d in North America for a fee.Joining \u201cAmerican Made\u201d in wide release over the weekend was another Cross Creek effort: \u201cFlatliners,\u201d a science-fiction horror film (a remake of the 1990 version, a cult favorite) that cost $19 million to make and was distributed by Sony. It tanked, collecting about $6.7 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fragments and Elephants: Howard Hodgkin\u2019s Eclectic Art Collection Is Sold", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 He had a lifelong habit of reading Agatha Christie novels, beginning at the end. His favorite food was Jell-O. He could never resist an elephant.Collectors of an older generation can be refreshingly human in contrast to the financially minded alternative investors who are now proliferating in the art market.The 454-lot sale, titled \u201cHoward Hodgkin: Portrait of the Artist,\u201d raised 5.2 million pounds with fees, or about $6.8 million, \u00a3366,000 (about $480,000) of which was donated to several charities. About a quarter of the lots were bought by online bidders.\u201cHe never wanted to keep his own work,\u201d recalled Mr. Peattie, who had been Mr. Hodgkin\u2019s partner since 1984, the year before the artist won the Turner Prize. \u201cThe buying replenished that, and then he used the collection for his work. He took from it what he needed,\u201d he added. \u201cHe didn\u2019t keep money and would often overpay for things.\u201dSotheby\u2019s presale exhibition recreated the ambience of Mr. Hodgkin\u2019s studio and home in the Bloomsbury district of London, allowing people to see the relationships between the artist\u2019s vibrant paintings and prints and the Indian miniatures, Turkish tiles, Persian carpet fragments and other antiques that surrounded him.By any measure, Mr. Hodgkin had unusually eclectic taste, beyond the comfort zone of many of today\u2019s investment-minded collectors. This was duly reflected in what was, in pure financial terms, a relatively modest return for a lifetime of collecting. The final total of $6.8 million was less than a tenth of the current auction high for a single painting by Mr. Twombly.Had Mr. Hodgkin collected international contemporary art or held on to more of his own paintings \u2014 an early 1980s Hodgkin sold at Christie\u2019s earlier this month for $2.2 million \u2014 that total would have been far higher.Proceeds would also have been boosted if the sale had included the artist\u2019s renowned holdings of museum-quality Indian miniatures. Comprising some 130 drawings, the collection is being treated as a separate, single entity and will be available for sale privately at a price to be decided after the auction, according to Mr. Peattie.However, Sotheby\u2019s auction did include two paintings by Mr. Hodgkin from the 1960s that he had retained. These earlier, more figurative works are not from the most coveted phase of the artist\u2019s career, as was borne out by the below-estimate \u00a3248,750, or about $330,000, given by a British private collector for \u201cBedroom\u201d (1960-61), and the failure of \u201cTravelling\u201d (1961) to attract any bids.But 20 proofs of prints by Mr. Hodgkin all soared above their estimates, led by a \u00a332,500 (about $43,000) offer given by a bidder in the room for a proof of the large blue-and-white \u201cFrost\u201d (2000-2).\u201cThe prices of the prints were three or four times retail,\u201d said the London-based dealer Offer Waterman. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t treated to any of his first-rank paintings. They were transitional works.\u201dThe most hotly contested artwork at the auction was instead the 1972 painting \u201cDe-Luxe Tailors\u201d by the Indian modernist painter Bhupen Khakhar, who was a friend of Mr. Hodgkin\u2019s. The bidding on this piece, which shows two tailors in their shop, soared to \u00a31.1 million, or about $1.4 million, three times the estimate and an auction high for the artist. \u201cSweet Bowl,\u201d the much-admired 1966 painting by the British artist Patrick Caulfield, also a lifelong friend, was another standout lot, selling for \u00a3524,750, or about $690,000.The commercial appeal of the collection was further complicated by Mr. Hodgkin\u2019s enthusiasm for fragments rather than objects in complete condition.\u201cFragments were more potent than entire panels, because they freed the imagination,\u201d explained Mr. Peattie in his catalog foreword. These included a fragment of 17th-century Persian carpet, formerly owned by the legendary collector Robert von Hirsch, which sold for \u00a3224,750, or about $295,000. But there were also items like the bottom half of a 13th-century Persian Kashan luster pottery tile that failed to sell against a low estimate of \u00a32,000, or about $2,600. In all, 14 percent of the lots were left unsold, a relatively high figure for the collection of a prominent private individual.And then there were the elephants, featured in at least 40 of the Indian drawings included in the sale. Mr. Hodgkin regarded Rajasthan\u2019s Kota-style portraits of elephants in particular as \u201cmy downfall \u2014 my Waterloo\u201d as a collector, according to the catalog. Yet all but one of his elephant drawings sold, with a Kota image of an elephant stampede from the late 18th or early 19th century selling for \u00a332,500, more than 20 times the estimate.In the pure financial terms of the top end of the auction market, the sale of Mr. Hodgkin\u2019s collection could not be regarded as serious or important. Yet the connoisseurial refinement and curiosity of Mr. Hodgkin\u2019s taste served as a timely reminder of just how homogeneous the buying habits of today\u2019s investment-minded collectors have become.\u201cIt was a wonderful old-fashioned collection,\u201d said Ted Few, a London-based dealer, who bought a 17th-century German lime-wood relief sculpture for \u00a31,500, or about $2,000, at the Hodgkin sale. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from so many of today\u2019s collections. People are obsessed with specializing and are much more minimal in their approach.\u201dAdmittedly, Mr. Hodgkin became wealthy enough not to have to worry about overspending on Indian drawings of elephants. But in today\u2019s finance-obsessed times, collectors have become much more reluctant to lose money and a lot less curious about art history.

She noted that professional football teams benefit when local and state governments help them build stadiums but did not suggest that Congress should try to block those lower governments from doing so.\u201cI think he\u2019s just making the point that if these individuals are going to be supported in large part and subsidized by taxpayers, that a large percentage and majority of Americans have said that they want N.F.L. players to stand,\u201d she said. \u201cThe federal tax law doesn\u2019t apply here,\u201d she acknowledged, \u201cbut certainly we know that they receive tax subsidies on a variety of different levels.\u201dESPN has faced significant challenges recently and is now available in just under 88 million homes, compared with 100 million homes in 2011. In the first half of 2017, its prime-time ratings were up 1 percent compared with the same period in 2016, although its total day ratings were down more than 5 percent. But ESPN is still a ratings behemoth and still highly profitable. In the third quarter, it led full-time cable networks in total day and prime-time ratings among the key demographics of men ages 18 to 54.The president continues to be animated by his fight with the sports world. He has enthusiastically kept up his attacks on the N.F.L., with which he has a long history of antagonism. A onetime owner of the New Jersey Generals in the upstart United States Football League, Mr. Trump persuaded other owners to sue the N.F.L. using antitrust law. The U.S.F.L. won the case, but the jury awarded only $1 in damages \u2014 tripled to $3 by law \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s league ultimately folded.The N.F.L.\u2019s tax exemption has long been controversial. The league\u2019s 32 teams are for-profit businesses that pay taxes accordingly, but the central office became a nonprofit organization decades ago. In response to the criticism, the league in 2015 voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status because of what it called the \u201cdistraction.\u201dIt is not clear that it cost the league much money. While the league as a whole generates billions of dollars in revenue a year, the league office ran a deficit of $13.5 million in the fiscal year that ended a year before the decision to give up the tax-exempt status. But the change meant the league no longer had to disclose what it paid its commissioner, Roger Goodell.In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Joe Lockhart, the N.F.L. spokesman, said the league receives no \u201cmassive\u201d tax breaks, as Mr. Trump contended.Regarding the player protests, Mr. Lockhart said the league\u2019s 260-page game operations manual has not changed and he highlighted the precise language governing the anthem. The players, he said, \u201cmust\u201d be on the sidelines during the playing of the anthem and \u201cshould\u201d stand for the anthem. The league, however, has \u201cnot chosen to discipline any of the players\u201d who have not stood for the anthem, he said.That might change next week, though, when the owners meet in New York, where the anthem protests will be on the agenda. Mr. Goodell and the owners want the players to stand \u201cbecause we think it\u2019s an important part of the game,\u201d Mr. Lockhart said, and \u201cthere\u2019s a strong feeling at every level that we ought to be getting back to football.\u201dSports teams have benefited in other ways under tax law. Many franchises have built new stadiums in cooperation with cities and states that floated bonds to finance construction. Municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes, leading critics to complain that taxpayers are subsidizing profitable private businesses. Mr. Lockhart said local government subsidies hade been an \u201ceconomic engine\u201d for those communities.The biggest beneficiary was not a football franchise but the New York Yankees, the president\u2019s hometown baseball team, which Brookings estimated saved $492 million as a result. Among the football owners who have benefited from such bonds was Mr. Trump\u2019s friend Mr. Jones, whose Dallas Cowboys saved $88 million in building AT&T Stadium.It was unclear how Congress might prohibit states, counties and cities from deciding how to spend their tax revenue, or whether it could undo deals that were approved years ago. It is also unclear whether it would be possible for legislators to target teams in one league, like the N.F.L., and not another, like Major League Baseball.The federal government has limited room to act against the N.F.L. in other areas. The league has all but abandoned its policy of blacking out games in home markets when teams fail to sell out their stadiums, giving the Federal Communications Commission less oversight over professional football. The league, however, does have something akin to an antitrust exemption, thanks to a 1966 law, that allows every team to band together to negotiate television deals.Peter Baker reported from Washington and Ken Belson from New York.

{"Headline": "Unintended Consequences of Sexual Harassment Scandals", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExtra CautionIn Silicon Valley, some male investors have declined one-on-one meetings with women, or rescheduled them from restaurants to conference rooms. On Wall Street, certain senior men have tried to avoid closed-door meetings with junior women. And in TV news, some male executives have scrupulously minded their words in conversations with female talent.In interviews, the men describe a heightened caution because of recent sexual harassment cases, and they worry that one accusation, or misunderstood comment, could end their careers. But their actions affect women\u2019s careers, too \u2014 potentially depriving them of the kind of relationships that lead to promotions or investments.The Society for Human Resource Management, an industry group, said it saw a spike in questions from members about sexual harassment in March \u2014 when cases at Uber, Fox News and military academies were in the news \u2014 and in August, when harassment surfaced again at Fox, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.In some cases, the heightened awareness has improved people\u2019s behavior. \u201cPeople are more sensitive to how they conduct themselves, because they\u2019ve seen what can happen,\u201d said a male executive in the news and entertainment industry, who spoke anonymously because of the same heightened caution over the topic that is in the air in some workplaces. \u201cThat\u2019s presented a better working environment.\u201dSome tech investors have taken similar steps. \u201cA big chill came across Silicon Valley in the wake of all these stories, and people are hyperaware and scared of behaving wrongly, so I think they\u2019re drawing all kinds of parameters,\u201d said a venture capitalist who spoke anonymously for the same reason.Some are avoiding solo meetings with female entrepreneurs, potential recruits and those who ask for an informational or networking meeting.\u201cBefore, you might have said, \u2018Of course I would do that, and I will especially do it for minorities, including women in Silicon Valley,\u2019 \u201d the investor said. \u201cNow you cancel it because you have huge reputational risk all of a sudden.\u201dIt has not happened in every workplace, of course, and depends in part on company culture and employees\u2019 trust in human resources to appropriately deal with harassment. In interviews with people across industries, many said interacting with members of the opposite sex was a nonissue. People were warier in jobs that emphasized appearance, as with certain restaurants or TV networks; in male-dominated industries like finance; and in jobs that involve stark power imbalances, like doctors or investors.Dr. Mukund Komanduri, 50, an orthopedic surgeon with a practice outside Chicago, said he avoids being alone with female colleagues, particularly those he does not know well or who are subordinates.\u201cI\u2019m very cautious about it because my livelihood is on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone in your hospital says you had inappropriate contact with this woman, you get suspended for an investigation, and your life is over. Does that ever leave you?\u201dHe mentioned a hospital colleague who lost his job because of harassment allegations. \u201cThat individual has created a hypersensitive atmosphere for every other physician,\u201d he said. \u201cWe basically stand 10 feet away from everyone we know.\u201dThe effect on women\u2019s careers is quantifiable, research has found.Good sponsors also give candid, difficult feedback, and women are less likely than men to receive it, McKinsey and Lean In found.One of them regularly invited her to go for walks and grab coffee. \u201cTrust does get built through intimacy and understanding others and sharing values,\u201d she said. \u201cThat comes from interactions that are one-on-one, and not super formal in a conference room with an agenda.\u201dOne way to encourage these relationships is to have more people at the top of companies who are not straight white men. In interviews, women in companies with many female or gay executives were more likely to say one-on-one relationships had never been an issue for them.Another way is for companies to explicitly support relationship-building meetings. Some companies, for instance, have designated a certain restaurant where senior leaders take prot\u00e9g\u00e9es for breakfast or lunch. \u201cOnce you see it happening out in public, then it becomes the norm,\u201d said Laura Sherbin, director of research at the Center for Talent Innovation.She added, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want people to judge you when you go out with a senior leader, don\u2019t be someone who judges another person.\u201dIt helps when leaders talk about their families, introduce junior employees to their spouses or invite them to their homes, researchers said.\u201cIt\u2019s walking down the hallway, it\u2019s seeking the opinion of others, it\u2019s catching someone after a meeting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be an unintentional blind spot, but it\u2019s something you could start changing on a Monday morning.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Uses Its Oil Giant, Rosneft, as a Foreign Policy Tool", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia is increasingly wielding oil as a geopolitical tool, spreading its influence around the world and challenging the interests of the United States.But Moscow risks running into trouble, as it lends money and makes deals in turbulent economies and shaky political climates.The strategy faces a crucial test this week in Venezuela, a Russian ally that must come up with a billion dollars to avert defaults on its debts.Russia has been making a flurry of loans and deals all centered on the Venezuelan oil business, money that could make the difference between the government\u2019s collapse and its survival. In return, Moscow is getting a strategic advantage in Washington\u2019s backyard.President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela was all smiles this month on a visit to Moscow seeking fresh financial backing, thanking Vladimir V. Putin \u201cfor your support, both political and diplomatic.\u201dMoscow, through the state oil giant Rosneft, is trying to build influence in places where the United States has stumbled or power is up for grabs. Its efforts are also driven out of necessity, as American and European sanctions have forced Rosneft to find new partners and investments elsewhere.The company, which Russia has long relied on to finance its government and social programs, has been pushing deeply into politically sensitive countries like Cuba, China, Egypt and Vietnam, as well as tumultuous places where American interests are at stake.Rosneft is looking for deals around the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, areas of tactical importance beyond the energy picture. It is wielding economic and political sway in northern Iraq, by making big oil and natural-gas deals in Kurdish territory. And it is angling to bid for control of Iranian oil fields as tensions between Tehran and Washington escalate.Rosneft is \u201ctrying to create opportunities that can be extremely valuable in geopolitical ways,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThey really give the Russian government unbelievable leverage on questions of importance to the United States.\u201dThe new push by Rosneft follows a clampdown on Russia.Rosneft, which is 50 percent owned by the Russian state, is led by Igor I. Sechin, a former deputy prime minister and a close Putin ally. After the Russian invasion of Crimea three years ago, the United States and Europe hit Mr. Sechin with sanctions.Since then, Exxon Mobil and other Western oil companies have been prevented from using their technological expertise to help Rosneft develop deepwater, shale and Arctic oil and gas fields. That has forced Rosneft to go far and wide to find new oil fields to replace its reserves.Rosneft\u2019s biggest bet so far is Venezuela. Over the past three years, Russia and Rosneft have provided Caracas with $10 billion in financial assistance, helping Venezuela stave off default at least twice under the weight of as much as $150 billion in debt.Russia is effectively taking China\u2019s place as Venezuela\u2019s principal banker. While President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was in power, China lent Venezuela tens of billions of dollars for projects to be paid for with oil. But China quietly stopped making new loans, leaving Russia to fill the void.Last year, Rosneft took a 49.9 percent stake in Citgo, the Venezuelan state oil company\u2019s refining subsidiary in the United States, as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan to the Venezuelan company. The state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, used the money to pay its bills and keep its oil fields producing.The deal was sharply criticized by members of Congress, who warned that an eventual Russian takeover of Citgo would threaten national security. Citgo operates about 4 percent of American refining capacity and has a sprawling network of pipelines and gas stations. And Caracas remains highly dependent on the American market, since few refineries outside the United States can process large quantities of low-quality Venezuela crude.In April, Rosneft went further, providing a $1 billion advance payment for crude oil produced by the state oil company, crucial aid for it to make nearly $3 billion in payments to bondholders.But Russia\u2019s investments are not without risk. Venezuela\u2019s oil fields are aging and in disrepair. Oil service companies have been withdrawing after years of partial payments for their work. And fresh American sanctions have largely prohibited long-term loan transactions with Pdvsa or investments in other new government debt, making Venezuela\u2019s financial straits even more acute.\u201cRussia is the only country that can give Venezuela a lifeline to survive through the rest of the year,\u201d said Francisco J. Monaldi, an energy policy analyst at Rice University. \u201cChina has the capacity but not the willingness to do it, and that\u2019s why Venezuela is so desperate to get the Russian support. There is no other way out.\u201dVenezuela is now Rosneft\u2019s second-largest source of crude, after Russia itself. The Russian company resells about 225,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan oil, equivalent to 13 percent of Venezuela\u2019s exports.More Venezuelan oil could soon flow to Russia. Rosneft is negotiating with the Venezuelan state oil company to trade its collateral in Citgo for stakes in oil fields, as a way to gain more reserves at bargain basement prices and avert any sanctions or other legal issues with Washington.\u201cThere is absolutely a geopolitical element to these deals,\u201d said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cRosneft acquires cheap acreage in Venezuela, but does it also expand Vladimir Putin\u2019s influence in our backyard? Yes.\u201dRosneft\u2019s Venezuela model is also finding traction in the Middle East, where Russia is looking for ways to support the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, make friends in Iran and help drive a wedge between Turkey and the West.In the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, Moscow is seeking influence with competing sides. It follows a Kurdish referendum favoring independence from Baghdad that both the United States and Turkey fear will bring more instability to the region.Russia also formally opposes Kurdish independence. But that did not stop Rosneft from signing a $400 million deal with the Kurdistan regional government this month for oil field drilling rights.Russia had already invested more than $4 billion over the past year in the Kurdistan oil fields. And Rosneft became the largest buyer of Kurdish oil as Western oil companies reduced their investments.\u201cFor Russia to be able to play in and have influence over Kurdish politics is useful in Syria, and it\u2019s useful as a counterpressure on Turkey as well,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department\u2019s top energy diplomat in the first Obama administration.Now, Rosneft is angling for stakes in coming Iranian oil field auctions even while Mr. Putin seeks energy and other deals with Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s archrival.All the wheeling and dealing appears to be at its most aggressive in Venezuela, where Moscow\u2019s engagement is more risky.The Venezuelan government says it has more than $9 billion in currency reserves, though much of that is gold that must be sent abroad to liquidate, a transaction that can take time.The next major debt payment comes due on Thursday, for $1.2 billion, on a Pdvsa bond that is maturing. Flirting with default, the company scrambled to pay most but not all of a $1 billion bond due on Friday, while the country still owes $350 million more in payments that were due this month.The American sanctions against Venezuela, declining production and recurring pipeline and port disruptions have prompted several refiners to turn to other Latin American countries for supplies.Should there be a default and the Maduro government collapses, Russia and Rosneft could be left holding bad loans that a new government might not want to pay.\u201cWill Russia continue to fund Venezuela?\u201d asked Siobhan Morden, Nomura Holdings\u2019 head of Latin America fixed income strategy. \u201cThat is still a question. I don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Two of the three, analysts say, were not surprising given their ages and the pattern of most chief executives to make management changes after assuming control.The most striking move, they say, is the departure of Jeffrey S.

And the criticism by activist investors who lobbied for change, helping nudge Mr. Immelt into retirement earlier than expected, was that G.E. should have cut costs more aggressively and spent less on new initiatives, like a building up G.E. software business.The strategy was Mr. Immelt\u2019s, but Mr. Bornstein held the purse strings. \u201cJeff Bornstein was Immelt\u2019s guy and he lost out in the succession race to John Flannery,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm. \u201cFlannery wants new guys, new faces and not someone tied to profit performance that fell short.\u201dIn the statement announcing his departure, Mr. Bornstein said, \u201cAs John evaluates the strategy for G.E. and puts his leadership team in place, he and I have concluded that this is the right time to bring in a new C.F.O. with a fresh perspective.\u201dG.E.\u2019s new chief financial officer will be Jamie S.

{"Headline": "Qatar Has a World Cup Date. It Still Needs a World-Class Team.", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDOHA, Qatar \u2014 On the sideline of a grass soccer field a few hundred yards from the recently renovated Khalifa International Stadium, Bora Milutinovic is receiving a stream of well-wishers in four languages. Milutinovic, who has taken the national teams of five countries to the World Cup, shakes hands with dozens of people, seamlessly switching among Serbian, Spanish, German and English, as a match begins in front of him.On this evening, Milutinovic is checking on the progress of Qatar\u2019s under-19 national team, which is playing its Croatian counterpart in the final of a friendly tournament.\u201cIt changes slowly,\u201d Milutinovic said. \u201cEvery day it gets better.\u201dBut perhaps not quickly enough.Five years before Qatar hosts the World Cup, and as dozens of nations book their places this week into next summer\u2019s tournament in Russia, the state of soccer in Qatar is still very much a work in progress. Construction projects for the tournament continue to reshape the country, and more than a half-dozen new stadiums are rising. But the project to build a world-class national soccer team remains an expensive work in progress.Yet there has been soul-searching within the country, too, about Qatar\u2019s approach to building a team; about whether past efforts to naturalize foreign players should be ramped up, or abandoned; about whether the importing of expensive, aging stars has raised the level of the domestic top division, the Qatar Stars League; and about the success of the Aspire Academy, a vast complex in Doha that now coaches tens of thousands of athletes across different sports.These questions all get to the heart of Qatar\u2019s soccer problem, which in reality may be one of simple demographics. Qatar has \u201cmaybe 300,000\u201d citizens, Milutinovic noted, and only a few thousand of them are licensed soccer players. And no amount of money, which oil- and gas-rich Qatar has in abundance, seems to be able to create more of them fast enough.A short drive from one of Qatar\u2019s air-conditioned soccer stadiums, deep inside a warren of corridors and TV studios, 10 men, all but one wearing Qatari traditional dress, sat on white cushions placed along a wall.They represented the great and good of Qatari soccer \u2014 former players, coaches and newspaper editors \u2014 and they were preparing to argue long into the night. This was the set of \u201cAl Majlis,\u201d a soccer talk show on the Al Kass network. The program is one of the most popular sports shows in the Middle East, and on this night there was much to discuss after a particularly bad-tempered local match.\u201cEveryone was tweeting, wait to see what they say on \u2018Al Majlis,\u2019\u201d Abdulaziz Breida, a young producer for the show, said in the darkened control room as his editor shouted camera instructions in Arabic. He was planning for a late night. \u201cWe might not finish until 2 or 3 in the morning,\u201d Breida said.Almost as soon as the cameras roll, the discussion crackles to life. One particularly dubious penalty decision is dissected over and over, from multiple angles, for close to 30 minutes. \u201cSometimes, during the Champions League or Emir Cup, this can last for 12 hours,\u201d Breida said of the show. Tonight\u2019s installment runs for a solid four.\u201cOne game with Saudi Arabia, we needed to draw and we lost,\u201d said Khalid Salman, a frequent guest on \u201cAl Majlis\u201d who played 135 times for Qatar\u2019s national team. \u201cIt is my bad luck I never went to the World Cup,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the World Cup is coming to us.\u201dWhat the Qatar team will look like in 2022 is a frequent topic on the show, and whenever Qataris talk soccer. Many here point to France and the United States as examples of countries that have benefited from naturalizing athletes who were born abroad.The issue is more sensitive, though, in soccer. As Qatar has waited for its Aspire graduates to fill its national team rosters, its soccer association for years relied on a controversial policy of naturalizations to fill the gaps. Even during this World Cup qualification cycle, Qatar\u2019s roster included players born in Brazil, Uruguay, France and Guinea.\u201cAnyone who gets a Qatar passport, we\u2019ll respect him,\u201d Jassim said. \u201cBut we can talk about why are we taking players who are not quality? This is why the fans are angry.\u201d\u201cThey have talent, they are technical,\u201d Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez says of his Qatari teammates at Al Sadd, the Qatar Stars League club he has played for since 2015. \u201cThe big difference is, tactically, they don\u2019t know how we attack, how we defend. That is the big difference. Conceptuality. On the field.\u201dXavi\u2019s presence here, too, is part of the broader Qatari soccer development plan. A World Cup champion with Spain and a Champions League winner with Barcelona, Xavi said he was ready to leave La Liga two years ago, feeling he could no longer play at the highest level. So he moved to Qatar, in part because of the money, but also to train as a coach.But part of Xavi\u2019s job, as an experienced professional with a glittering r\u00e9sum\u00e9, is to help promote Qatar 2022, and to nurture the next generation of domestic players.That, too, is part of Qatar\u2019s long-range plan. Aspire bought the clubs as part of its strategy to set up a soccer pipeline that would include Qatari players, and expose the best of them to better competition, first at home and then abroad.But that weekend, only a few hundred supporters turned up at Al Sadd\u2019s Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium to see Xavi turn a match around. His two defense-splitting passes led to two goals, and to Al Sadd\u2019s 2-1 victory over Al-Gharafa.Outside the stadium, in the oppressive evening humidity, a group of around 70 local boys wearing traditional white robes waited to meet their heroes, and also to shout abuse and throw Qatari riyal notes at the opposition.\u201cThey have three or four very good players with talents,\u201d Milutinovic said of the Qatari side. \u201cBut you never know what will happen in the future.\u201dBy the time the 2022 World Cup kicks off, many of these players will be 24 and approaching their prime. Well before then, some may head to Europe. A few probably will feature in next year\u2019s Asian under-23 championship in China, the next chance for Aspire\u2019s players to get competitive experience, and for the men from \u201cAl Majlis\u201d to chew over how they do.That is why, at least for now, Milutinovic, continues to preach patience. In the early 1990s, he spent more than three years grooming an internationally unproven United States team to host a home World Cup in 1994.\u201cYou need to believe, you need to dream, you need to prepare good,\u201d he said of the similar project he sees playing out now. \u201cBut to be ready, you need to be ready in 2022, in June. Only this is important. One week before the World Cup, you can speak that your team is ready for the World Cup. Not before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conservative Website First Funded Anti-Trump Research by Firm That Later Produced Dossier", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website funded by a major Republican donor, first hired the research firm that months later produced for Democrats the salacious dossier describing ties between Donald J. Trump and the Russian government, the website said on Friday.The Free Beacon informed the House Intelligence Committee on Friday that it had retained the firm. That committee is one of a number of congressional committees investigating Russian attempts to disrupt the 2016 election and whether there was any collusion with Mr. Trump\u2019s associates.The role of the website answers one of the lingering mysteries behind the events leading up to the production of the dossier and its publication by BuzzFeed in January.It has long been known that Fusion GPS was first hired by Republicans, but it was not known who was the source of the funding. This week, Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the fact that Democrats had paid the firm for the research as evidence that the dossier was part of a political smear campaign.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that Democrats had funded the dossier, calling it \u201ca very sad commentary on politics in this country.\u201dAt the heart of the story is Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research firm founded by former Wall Street Journal employees. Little is known about the firm\u2019s list of clients, and Republicans in Congress have pressed the firm and one of its founders, Glenn Simpson, to hand over documents about the funding and research that produced the dossier.The Free Beacon\u2019s editor, Matthew Continetti, and its chairman, Michael Goldfarb, said in a statement that the website was not involved in the dossier.\u201cAll of the work that Fusion GPS provided to The Free Beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that The Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.\u201dHe went on to produce a series of memos that alleged a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Mr. Trump. The memos, which became known as the \u201cSteele dossier,\u201d also contained unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, as well as real estate deals that were intended as bribes.Speculation had circulated for months that Mr. Singer was involved in the dossier, but his allies had denied that. On Friday, an associate said Mr. Singer had not been aware of the dossier or Mr. Steele\u2019s involvement in Fusion GPS\u2019s research until January, when BuzzFeed published the dossier.Mr. Singer was among the leading Republican critics of Mr. Trump during the Republican presidential primary race. Even after Mr. Singer\u2019s first choice, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, dropped out of the race, Mr. Singer continued to fund efforts to block Mr. Trump from the party\u2019s nomination.The revelation of The Free Beacon\u2019s involvement with Fusion GPS threatens a rapprochement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Singer, who donated $1 million to the president\u2019s inaugural fund and has visited the White House on multiple occasions. After one such visit, Mr. Trump declared that Mr. Singer \u201cwas very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, \u2018Never Trump,\u2019 and Paul just left, and he\u2019s given us his total support and it\u2019s all about unification.\u201dJosh Levy, a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, said questions about who funded Mr. Steele\u2019s work should be secondary to its credibility.Investigators working with several congressional committees and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, have delved into Mr. Steele\u2019s work as part of inquiries into connections between Russia and Mr. Trump and his associates, including whether they conspired to influence last year\u2019s election.The Free Beacon\u2019s notification to the House Intelligence Committee came a few days before a deadline set by a federal judge for Fusion GPS\u2019s bank to respond to a subpoena issued by the committee for financial records that could have revealed who funded the dossier.Fusion GPS had filed a motion to block the subpoena on the grounds that it would \u201cirreparably damage\u201d the company\u2019s business and also \u201cchill\u201d its free speech rights and those of \u201cmany others engaging in opposition research on political candidates.\u201dIn a telephone conference with representatives for Fusion GPS, the committee and the bank, the judge hearing the case said that Fusion GPS\u2019s clients have \u201cthe expectation of confidentiality.\u201d But the judge added that it was \u201cnot to say that the congressional committee doesn\u2019t have interests that may trump those expectations of confidentiality.\u201dThe firm\u2019s connection to Democrats was revealed in a letter this week from Matthew J. Gehringer, the general counsel of the law firm Perkins Coie. The letter said that Fusion GPS had already been conducting the research \u201cfor one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest,\u201d and urged the earlier clients to waive their confidentiality \u201cgiven the interest in this issue.\u201dPerkins Coie was paid $12.4 million to represent the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 race, according to campaign finance filings, though most of that money probably went to legal compliance.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the position of Matthew J. Gehringer at the law firm Perkins Coie. He is the general counsel, not a managing partner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ending Cash-Register Justice", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn a quest for revenue, Ferguson officers trapped poor and minority citizens in a Kafka-esque cycle that began with fines they could not pay and led to crippling financial penalties, revoked driver\u2019s licenses, jail time, lost jobs and ruined lives. The investigation showed that municipalities had essentially recreated debtor prisons, violating the Constitution by punishing people for being poor.Last year, the Justice Department followed up its Ferguson report with a letter asking court systems nationwide to be vigilant against similar policies. It explained that the courts had an obligation to ask people about their ability to pay before jailing them for nonpayment and were also bound to consider alternatives like community service or extended payment plans. The department also awarded grants to state courts in five states to help develop new approaches to fine and fee enforcement.According to the Civil Rights Commission report, Texas will use some of its grant for an automated system that judges can use to determine inability to pay. Beyond that, a national task force financed by the Justice Department created a blueprint for state reforms, with model laws and ideas about how to prevent local governments and traffic courts from lapsing into unconstitutional practices.Some judges have been outspoken about unfair use of fines. Last year, for example, the chief justice of Arizona issued an administrative order authorizing judges to mitigate mandatory fines and fees if the amount imposed an economic hardship and advised a state task force to take other steps. The chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court went further this year, admonishing politicians for treating the courts like \u201cA.T.M.s,\u201d and pointing out, \u201cNo one in America should be sent to jail \u2014 or threatened with jail \u2014 solely because they are poor.\u201dUnfortunately, most states have done little or nothing to reform justice systems that clearly violate the Constitution. Judges need to keep pressing this point \u2014 and the Justice Department has an obligation to help them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Former Superagent Bets Big on a More Diverse Hollywood", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "The Culture IssueAfter years as the industry\u2019s top African-American talent agent, Charles D. King is building an audacious new production company \u2014 with a vision for bringing long-neglected stories to the screen.Supported byAt the end of a grueling day and a half trying to sell his slate of new projects, Charles D. King \u2014 the 48-year-old founder of a two-year-old media start-up called Macro \u2014 piled with his associates into the back of a black S.U.V. to make his way to the house that was serving as their festival hub. Until recently, King was one of Hollywood\u2019s top agents, the only African-American to make partner at William Morris Endeavor in the firm\u2019s long history. (If you\u2019ve turned on a television, watched a movie or listened to popular music in the past decade, you\u2019ve almost surely witnessed the other side of a deal King brokered.) As difficult as any midcareer job change can be, King\u2019s was an even rarer thing: Starting Macro meant stepping down from a rarefied perch he\u2019d spent his entire professional life fighting to reach. The uncertainty of starting a new business was only compounded by the audacity of King\u2019s vision. He announced Macro not simply as a production house but as an entire media company, one whose content would reflect the new demographics of America \u2014 solving a problem the media industry only fitfully, grudgingly acknowledges is even real.King\u2019s rented bungalow sat at the top of a residential street on a small foothill, but with a blizzard still pummeling the town, the Uber driver found his S.U.V. sliding down the icy grade. Backing up and gunning uphill again only sent the car spinning sideways. After one last halfhearted, face-saving attempt, King and an entourage that included his wife, Stacey Walker King, nodded sympathetically before bundling into their parkas to walk the rest of the way. On the trudge uphill, everyone lashed by the wind and complaining of hunger, King alone seemed enraptured by the falling snow and went loping energetically up the slope, pulling the rest of the party along with his enthusiasm.Macro has made waves with some early projects, like Denzel Washington\u2019s Oscar-nominated film adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s \u201cFences,\u201d but it\u2019s still a new venture, and it has a start-up\u2019s shoot-the-moon sense of urgency and excitement. Inside the house, a boisterous late-night crew \u2014 including several Macro executives and part of the youthful cast and crew of \u201cGente-fied,\u201d a digital project about generational and class tension in the Los Angeles Mexican-American community \u2014 was already joking, decompressing and discussing the day\u2019s films, panels and deal-making. King had brought several titles to the festival, each of them carefully positioned and, so far, enthusiastically received. One of them had become a darling of the festival: Dee Rees\u2019s \u201cMudbound,\u201d a World War II drama about two families from opposite sides of the race line. Still, at 10 p.m., as he sat down to eat, King didn\u2019t have distribution in place for any of his projects. Before starting on the turkey sandwich he\u2019d made himself, he placed two cellphones on the table, next to a glass of sweet tea. \u201cIt\u2019s an old agent\u2019s trick,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou always carry two phones, in case one dies or loses reception.\u201dIn his past life as an agent, King carried no real financial risk: Agents are paid a percentage of the deals they negotiate. As the founder of a media company, each deal he strikes has a material impact not only on his own fate but also on those of his employees and investors. Perhaps the most formidable obstacle to Macro\u2019s success is a body of received wisdom about why the world on our screens looks so different from the real world it ostensibly mirrors \u2014 ideas about how films starring black actors don\u2019t do as well in crucial overseas markets, or that Hollywood has no bias against women, or that Asian men can\u2019t be leading men. There are countless claims like these, almost all of them unsubstantiated, tautological or otherwise self-serving. King\u2019s project is to break down these barriers, and he exudes a quiet confidence in his vision: that there is vast cultural and economic opportunity in telling meaningful stories to diverse audiences. He describes this effort as \u201ca front in the civil rights battle.\u201d Past generations marched for things the law could do, like dismantling housing segregation or securing voting rights. King wants to accomplish something the law cannot: using film to fill in the subtle degrees of experience that reveal our lives to one another. When people look at all the ubiquitous screens that surround us, King wants us to see ourselves. Not only African-Americans, but everyone.In King\u2019s own career, breaking down barriers has meant keeping cool and taking his lumps \u2014 some of them simply for being an outsider \u2014 as he studied the business and fought his way up from a subminimum-wage position in the William Morris mailroom. Macro is the culmination of his life\u2019s work and the realization of dreams he has nursed since he was just another scrawny kid in Georgia. If the projects the company champions do well, then King, and everything he serves, will do well, too. If not, he will have made a life-defining miscalculation. So as the rest of Park City partied or slept, King swiveled back and forth between his sandwich and his phones. His face, which has a boyish enthusiasm when he\u2019s excited, turns profoundly focused when he considers the business aspect of things; in unguarded moments he sometimes looks as beatific as a Dostoyevsky character. You get the sense of a man whose neural network is wired differently \u2014 so much so that I felt compelled to ask his wife, Stacey, about these reveries when I ran into her in the Salt Lake City airport. \u201cOh, you saw that?\u201d she asked. \u201cCharles daydreams. He stares into space. I didn\u2019t understand at first. Now I get it. He\u2019s processing, making connections. There\u2019s a real vision there.\u201dYet each of those recent success stories was an independent production, with origins outside the clubby confines of Hollywood studios. Making film and television is an expensive gamble, and when the people making the wagers all come from a single demographic, the only certainty is that their own point of view will always be well represented. \u201cIt think it\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d says the ICM agent Andrea Nelson Meigs, whose clients include Beyonc\u00e9 and Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis. \u201cPeople buy what they relate to. People buy what they\u2019re familiar with. If the person behind the desk doesn\u2019t relate to the experience of the person in front of it, it\u2019s 50-50.\u201d She illustrated this with a story from her own office, where she was surprised to learn that of several young assistants, only one, an African-American woman, was aware of the iconic activist Angela Davis, the subject of a potential biopic. \u201cIf that\u2019s the room we\u2019re pitching,\u201d Nelson Meigs says, \u201cthat story doesn\u2019t get made.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t help that Hollywood relies on tweaking proven formulas, meaning any filmmaker without successful antecedents they can use to back up their ideas will face high hurdles. The one area where African-Americans have found relatively consistent recent success in the industry has been the popular work of directors like Lee Daniels, F. Gary Gray or Tyler Perry, to which audiences flock for the same reason whole neighborhoods once gathered around the television: because they will see themselves on the screen, and because they know they will not feel insulted by what they see. It has not been easy to secure even that much, let alone opportunities to make more psychologically and artistically ambitious films. \u201cWhen I started it was the age of Spike Lee,\u201d says Poppy Hanks, Macro\u2019s senior vice president for production, who attended the University of Southern California at the same time as John Singleton, and whose early career coincided with the commercial success of movies like \u201cSoul Food\u201d (which she worked on) and \u201cWaiting to Exhale.\u201d \u201cThere was just a wave that gave us a sense it was all possible.\u201d As she made her way into the business, though, she saw how difficult it could be to push such films through the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s always shocking to them when something succeeds,\u201d she says. \u201cNot to us, but to them.\u201dKing\u2019s career has spanned both reliable franchises like the \u201cBarbershop\u201d movies and more ambitious films like \u201cFruitvale Station.\u201d He understands what pleases crowds, but he also understands the narrowness of current cinema and the pent-up creative energies outside it. \u201cThe specific message I want to resonate,\u201d he says, \u201cis people of color have stories to tell.\u201d Part of this conviction comes from his youth, when he watched his mother try to publish the novel she worked on every day after coming home, only to be met with rejection by industry gatekeepers. \u201cI remember the impact that had on her,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made her question whether she was a gifted writer, and she was.\u201d He does not say it, but it is clear in his tone that he still thinks the rejections had less to do with merit than with other forces. The business of culture is one of the most subjective in American society, and its executive suites are all filled with unintentional, unexamined biases. Added together, those biases can still accomplish nearly the same ends as the outright aggression directed at people of color a century ago. There was no animus toward King\u2019s mother. They simply couldn\u2019t see her, or her story.After Vanderbilt, King enrolled at the historically black Howard University for law school. It was a summer internship at MTV that gave him his first real exposure to the media industry, and it was while living in 1990s New York that he met Stacey Walker, a 22-year-old recent Duke graduate. She recalls their first meeting as anything but fateful: She was leaving a party with friends, and King and his friends were on their way in, an encounter he claimed not to remember when they ran into each other again shortly afterward. Nonetheless, they were soon dating seriously. He moved to Los Angeles a year later; after a year and half, Stacey joined him. They\u2019ve been together some 20 years.\u201cWhile all the sons and daughters of studio heads were out with each other, I would stay behind and talk to Rick,\u201d King recalls \u2014 meaning Rick Palacio, the assistant supervisor of the mailroom. Despite the meager pay, King saw the mailroom as \u201ca gold mine\u201d of information and possibility. He was promoted to assistant on the desk of an agent, then quickly removed. \u201cI was not a great assistant,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was too focused on the big picture. What I really needed to learn was that paying your dues was more than going through the motions.\u201d When he found himself with a second shot in the mailroom, he redoubled his efforts: \u201cI was going to get fired or promoted.\u201dHe credits the firm\u2019s African-American clients \u2014 and their managers and other assorted \u201cpeople\u201d \u2014 with making sure it was the promotion. He may have been a junior employee, but some bigger industry players gravitated toward him, in part because he understood their clients\u2019 value in ways others in the agency did not. He also had a talent for building community. \u201cBecause there are so few people of color, we all know each other,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cThere was an unspoken locking of the arms. We were all kids figuring it out. I don\u2019t even know if Charles knows this, but I know both my bosses were putting pressure on his bosses to promote him.\u201dEventually, King says, \u201cthere was a groundswell\u201d of people lobbying his cause. In 2000, he escaped the mailroom for good. Still, there were many within the office who \u201cwere sniggering at the things I was suggesting,\u201d he remembers. One such incident, which I first heard about from Mike Palank, his assistant at the time and now an executive at Macro, concerned a weekly meeting in which agents at William Morris speculated about how the firm\u2019s movie openings would do in each weekend\u2019s box office. The week before one of King\u2019s projects opened, he attended expectantly, only to find his client\u2019s movie wasn\u2019t even on the agenda. He was vindicated by Monday morning, when the receipts were counted \u2014 and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cDiary of a Mad Black Woman\u201d turned out to have the highest gross in the country.Agents negotiate between talent and money. They can connect, nurture and translate, but the ultimate decision-making power lies elsewhere. With Macro, finally, the decisions are King\u2019s. He has designed the company with great care: Macro is situated at the intersection of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, combining the core elements of a production company with an aggressive focus on digital platforms. The companies King cites as similar to Macro include both content behemoths like Vice and nimble midsize production companies like Legendary, whose movies \u2014 including \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d \u2014 punch above their weight. Shortly after I saw him at Sundance, \u201cMudbound\u201d won the largest distribution deal of any movie at the festival. \u201cGente-fied\u201d ignited a bidding war among six networks. \u201cFences\u201d won an Oscar for Viola Davis. Maybe most remarkable, King closed a second round of funding \u2014 just announced in recent days \u2014 to the tune of $150 million. \u201cI think there\u2019s an enormous hunger for these stories,\u201d says one lead investor, Laurene Powell Jobs, who has known King since they worked together on the board of a nonprofit. \u201cHe\u2019s at the forefront. All of us who saw something special in Charles are just seeing what he\u2019s capable of.\u201dStacey has known longer than most. \u201cCharles told me he was going to build a media company on our first date,\u201d she says. \u201cThings never look exactly as you imagine them, but it\u2019s what he always said he wanted to do.\u201d King plans to produce or co-produce between four and six films a year, with a maximum investment of $35 million, in addition to \u201cat least three shows on streaming, or television and cable,\u201d an unspecified number of digital shows and a portfolio of investments in pure technology companies. Projects in development include another project with Washington, as well as collaborations with Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, Van Jones, Eva Longoria and Justin Simien. \u201cCharles and I have been fighting this fight for 18 years,\u201d says Hanks, one of Macro\u2019s first hires. \u201cI know we\u2019ve done really well. Now we have to keep it up.\u201dThe offices are in a rapidly transforming corridor of Los Angeles. The work of up-and-coming artists adorns the walls; the soundtrack is classic rap, and the work force looks as harmoniously multicultural and gender-balanced as America imagines itself. These employees aren\u2019t just betting their fates on the movie business but on interlocking shifts in demographics, culture and technology. Macro, King believes, is in the vanguard of a new cultural universe, one made possible by the shrinking space between technology and film. \u201cWe\u2019re building a global company for a new majority. We won\u2019t be the only one.\u201d He begins listing mighty firms that fell (MGM, Blockbuster, Time Warner), noting new entities that sprang up seemingly from nowhere (Netflix) and theorizing what the landscape may look like decades from now \u2014 before going abruptly silent, to keep from tipping too much of his own hand. \u201cWell, you can imagine,\u201d he concludes, cutting across several lanes of rush-hour traffic on the freeway after missing an exit.King is not the first to see the problem of diversity in popular culture; it has been apparent since the beginning, and like every struggle for equality in this post-civil rights country, in this post-colonial world, it has been a generation-over-generation battle. His challenge to us \u2014 to imagine new cultural possibilities \u2014 also challenges the sense everyone in the old order has of being an expert about the culture. What if the world we think we know is only a tiny, myopic fraction of it? What if the things we believe we understand are nothing but learned patterns? We imagine that wanting to be inclusive and cosmopolitan makes us so, but we continue to be produced by and inhabit the structures that create oppression. This is precisely what makes it so important that Hollywood be truly democratic: It represents so much of the inner, the hidden and exceptional, of this country. If there is no space for the visions of the most talented among us no matter where they come from \u2014 or how strange their ideas may seem to those who cannot comprehend them \u2014 what possible future can we really have but the most ordinary?As the sun set, King piloted his Tesla noiselessly down the 101, oblivious to the way he was disrupting traffic. He finished his final call of the day in the last amber hour of light on this side of the Pacific, and I watched him stare intently into the distance behind his sunglasses in the silent interior of the car. White-knuckling the corner of my seat, something Stacey said returned to me \u2014 his processing, his making connections. I understood he was dreaming.Calvin Baker teaches at Columbia University and is the author of four novels, including \u201cGrace\u201d and \u201cDominion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking the Peace of the Suburbs", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntWith two small children crammed into a two-bedroom co-op in Yorkville, Briana Tortoso was ready to head for the suburbs. \u201cThe space was closing in on us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like a toy box.\u201dFor her, the decision to decamp was easy; for her husband, Matthew, less so. \u201cHad my second child been a boy, we would still be there,\u201d Mr. Tortoso said. \u201cWe would have bunk beds, and we would have called it a day.\u201d (Their children, JohnCarlo and Mia, are now 5 and 3.)Mrs. Tortoso, 40, who works in advertising for the Game Show Network, and Mr. Tortoso, who is also 40 and works in finance, began their search two years ago, with a budget of $1 million or more. They were focusing on Westchester County, where they could find a house within an hour\u2019s train commute of Midtown, because both work near Grand Central Terminal.They hoped for a house with a big yard, on a cul-de-sac where their children could easily cross the street to see friends, and they avoided towns that didn\u2019t have school buses.But nothing they found was quite right. Sometimes they disliked a layout, or a house was too big. Many of the houses they saw hadn\u2019t been updated in decades, and the need to spend $100,000 or $200,000 on renovations worried them.The home-buying process, Mr. Tortoso said, felt like a game of musical chairs: You had to pick from whatever was available at any given moment.Buying there, Mr. Tortoso said, would have been \u201clike moving into freshman class,\u201d and the children would have had built-in friends. But the cul-de-sac where they found a $1.4 million house they liked was adjacent to high-voltage electrical power lines, and the Tortosos were concerned about potential health risks; also, ConEd performs periodic inspections by helicopter and trims the trees, and they were worried about the noise.In nearby Briarcliff Manor, they loved a home on Butternut Road, another cul-de-sac. A $1.2 million house, it had been fully renovated by a contractor, but it wasn\u2019t configured to their liking.A building lot was available in Pocantico Hills, Ms. Landau told them. But unfortunately, \u201cit was on a double-yellow-line\u201d road, Mrs. Tortoso said, not a cul-de-sac.Skeptical, the Tortosos drove up on a rainy weeknight and found they loved the location, next to a park. The contract came with an agreement to have the house built by ZappiCo, which they were already familiar with.The advantages of buying a new, custom-built house included the choice of \u201cmore efficient appliances, heating and cooling,\u201d said Jim Zappi, the owner of ZappiCo. \u201cThey are better insulated, so the cost of ownership is less.\u201dThe Tortosos signed on for $1.12 million, for a two-story, 3,000-square-foot house with four bedrooms and four bathrooms. But the project was more complex than they had envisioned.\u201cYou are making every decision \u2014 from knobs to hinges to countertops \u2014 and things you don\u2019t necessarily think of when you find a house that is already built, like where do you put the windows and how many windows do you want,\u201d Mrs. Tortoso said.\u201cYou invariably upgrade,\u201d she added, noting that they eventually chose nine-foot ceilings over eight-foot, and solid wood doors, with better soundproofing, over standard hollow doors.The construction took a year, twice as long as scheduled. The family arrived last spring, after selling their Yorkville co-op for about $1.43 million. Then Mr. and Mrs. Tortoso set to work on the landscaping, which was also more complicated than they expected.Now that they\u2019ve settled in, though, they revel in the suburban supermarkets, with wide aisles and roomy shopping carts. Still, there are trade-offs.\u201cYou can\u2019t swing by and have a slice of pizza,\u201d Mr. Tortoso said. \u201cWhatever you have at home in the house is what you have for dinner.\u201dMrs. Tortoso\u2019s main regret about their new home, she said, is not going with pocket doors in the bathroom that connects the children\u2019s bedrooms. The doors swing inward, and when both are open they nearly touch.As for Mr. Tortoso, he regrets that their new neighborhood is, in fact, \u201cnot a neighborhood \u2014 there\u2019s not going to be a block party.\u201dBut at night, they hear crickets rather than honking and sirens loud enough to wake the children. And the toys are largely confined to the basement playroom.\u201cI am able to step into a private room to make a work call, and not have kids all over me,\u201d Mr. Tortoso said. \u201cBefore, I\u2019d go to the hallway or the roof.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Czech Election Won by Anti-Establishment Party Led by Billionaire", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRAGUE \u2014 An anti-establishment party founded by a billionaire oligarch overpowered the Czech Republic\u2019s longstanding mainstream parties on Saturday, making the blunt-talking, enigmatic tycoon almost certain to become prime minister in a coalition government.Ano, the party formed by Andrej Babis, 63, had nearly 30 percent of the vote with 99 percent of ballots counted. The Social Democrats, who have been at the center of Czech politics for a quarter-century and had finished first in the previous election, came in a distant sixth with just 7 percent. The Communists were fifth. And the Christian Democrats, another party that traces its roots to the country\u2019s founding, got less than 6 percent, perilously close to the cutoff to qualify for seats in Parliament.Ano was not the only anti-establishment party to do well. The extreme right-wing Freedom & Direct Democracy, with 10.7 percent, doubled its proportion from the previous election. That was just a fraction of a percentage point behind the youth-oriented Czech Pirate Party, an anti-establishment movement from the opposite end of the political spectrum.In the previous parliamentary election, in 2013, Mr. Babis stunned the political establishment by drawing the second-highest number of votes, just one year after founding his party. That was enough to make Ano part of the ruling coalition with the Social Democrats and the smaller Christian Democrats, with Mr. Babis its finance minister. He was able to maintain his anti-establishment credentials by focusing on corruption and economic reforms.\u201cI am happy that Czech citizens did not believe the disinformation campaign against us and expressed their trust in us,\u201d Mr. Babis said in his victory speech at Ano headquarters. \u201cWe are a democratic movement, we are a pro-European and pro-NATO party, and I do not understand why somebody labels us as threat to democracy.\u201dOften compared to President Trump, Mr. Babis has mixed such nationalist themes as opposition to immigration with a promise to use his business skills to streamline government, reduce red tape and fight corruption. With mainstream parties in decline, as they have been in recent elections across Europe, his promise to upend the political establishment found a receptive audience.\u201cThe image of politics is corrupt,\u201d said Otto Eibl, a political scientist at Masaryk University in Brno. \u201cIt is quite easy to offer an alternative. When you say, \u2018All those old politicians are bad, and I will be good,\u2019 most people want to believe you.\u201dMr. Babis drew wide support from older Czech voters, fed up with corruption scandals and unfulfilled promises, who were willing to overlook their candidate\u2019s own legal issues.\u201cHis opponents are just trying to tarnish him, and people don\u2019t care about these political games,\u201d said Petr Sebor, 70, who was escorting his 91-year-old mother, Zdenka, to the polls on Friday, the first of two days of voting.What the ascent of Mr. Babis and Ano \u2014 which means \u201cyes\u201d in Czech and is also an acronym for Action of Dissatisfied Citizens \u2014 will mean for the Czech Republic\u2019s relations with Brussels and Moscow remains unclear.But there is concern he could join a nationalist bloc with Poland and Hungary and deepen the rift between the European Union and many of its eastern members. He has promised to protect Czechs from overreach by Brussels, but also to remain an active partner in the European Union. He has stressed that Prague needs to develop closer ties with all potential trading partners, including Russia.The first indication of his direction will come when he announces which parties will become partners in the new coalition government.Among the biggest surprises in the election was the strong showing by Freedom & Direct Democracy, the extreme right-wing party of Tomio Okamura, of mixed Czech and Japanese descent, who has lived in the Czech Republic since he was 6. Such right-wing parties, which have taken root elsewhere in Eastern Europe, had been largely inconsequential in Czech politics. But now, in a tight race for a distant second with the Civic Democrats, Mr. Okamura will become a larger force.Analysts had warned that the most recent polls may have understated Mr. Okamura\u2019s base as some voters were reluctant to acknowledge support of the controversial party. Mr. Okamura attributed the discrepancy to inept polling.Mr. Okamura said he opposed the country\u2019s mainstream parties and political establishment because its message is \u201cpro-Brussels, pro-multiculturalism and pro-Islam,\u201d while he sees Brussels as an adversary, Islam as an ideology rather than a religion and multiculturalism as a threat to Czech culture.\u201cWe want to keep the Czech Republic we remember from our childhoods,\u201d he said in an interview earlier this month. \u201cWhat is wrong with that?\u201dMr. Babis had said he would not ask either the Communists or Mr. Okamura\u2019s party to join his coalition. Karla Slechtova, the minister of regional development and an Ano member, said the party would like to discuss a coalition with the Social Democrats, though they alone would not be sufficient.\u201cThe elections have confirmed the downfall of traditional parties,\u201d said Milos Gregor, an analyst at the International Institute for Political Science. \u201cWith as many as nine parties in the government, we will most likely face a turbulent four years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We need something to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign as to not send any signal.\u201dMs. Sanders is referring to revelations last week that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Convention partially funded the so-called Steele dossier.

Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, who used Russian sources to compile his dossier.As news broke of the indictments, Mr. Trump sought to link Mr. Obama with Fusion GPS and the dossier.The Obama and Clinton campaigns may have shared a law firm, but Mr. Trump\u2019s allegation that Mr. Obama\u2019s organization also financed the Steele dossier is unproven.

We\u2019re thinking more about George Soros\u2019s big philanthropic move \u2014 while noting that he still hasn\u2019t signed the Giving Pledge. More on that in a moment.But should they be resting easy?Look at how the market reacted to the proposal by Senators Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander, to continue funding insurer subsidies for two years:But remember:\u2022 President Trump said that he supported the proposed compromise, although he could change his mind, and passage by Congress is far from assured.\u2022 The president also has let insurers sell cheaper, less comprehensive plans that could undermine the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges. Critics say that could lead to higher premiums for those who remain on exchange plans.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, hailed the agreement as a model for how the two parties could work together on other issues, such as taxes.There has never been any assurance that Democrats will join Republicans to pass a tax plan that favors only corporations.Recalcitrant lawmakers may have more ammunition for their stance from an unusual source: a Harvard University economist whose work has been cited by the White House in its assertion that lower corporate taxes could raise household incomes by as much as $9,000.The top end of that estimate was based on work by a trio of researchers, and on Tuesday one of them, Mihir Desai of Harvard, said Mr. Trump\u2019s team had misread the research. The actual income gain implied by his study, he estimated, would be $800.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team disagreed \u2014 saying Mr. Desai had erred in interpreting his own paper.\u201cTo the extent we get the tax deal done, the stock market will go up higher. But there\u2019s no question in my mind that if we don\u2019t get it done you\u2019re going to see a reversal of a significant amount of these gains.\u201dElsewhere in WashingtonThe appellate judges said it didn\u2019t matter whether law enforcement officials used a false statement from a Level Global employee to obtain a warrant to search the firm because the statement wasn\u2019t necessary to establish probable cause.Mr. Ganek was never accused of wrongdoing, but he said the negative publicity after the raid led to the collapse of the fund in 2011.His response to the court decision:This is a dangerous day for private citizens and a great day for ambitious, attention-seeking prosecutors who are now being rewarded with total immunity even when they lie and leak. The good news is this ruling does not preclude the Department of Justice from bringing disciplinary charges.The hedge fund manager\u2019s $18 billion in donations to his Open Society Foundations over the past few years \u2014 with $2 billion more planned in the coming years \u2014 is one of the largest transfers of wealth by a private donor to a single foundation.\u201cGiven America\u2019s place in the world right now, I think he\u2019s making an enormous statement,\u201d said Eileen Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust, a nonprofit that works with foundations. \u201cHe has a very clear point of view and he\u2019s not trying to hide it.\u201dBut it also means that Soros Fund Management, the fund that broke the Bank of England in 1992, will curtail the sort of risky big bets that made Mr. Soros famous.\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing process of migration from a hedge fund toward a pool of capital deployed to support a foundation over the long term,\u201d said Bill Ford, a committee member and the chief executive of General Atlantic LLC.The move could also have been a savvy tactic to reduce Mr. Soros\u2019s tax burden.Money managers have until the end of the year to pay taxes on fees they earned from investors in offshore funds and had deferred payment on. Many are now turning to charitable donations \u2014 including to their own foundations \u2014 to help offset the levies coming due.Despite giving billions to his foundation, Mr. Soros is one of the highest-profile billionaire philanthropists not to have signed the Giving Pledge, in which people like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have promised to give the bulk of their fortunes to charity.Nov. 3That\u2019s when Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chairman.The short list: The incumbent Janet Yellen, Jerome Powell, Kevin Warsh, John Taylor, Gary CohnGoldman SachsGoldman lacks the big lending and consumer businesses that buoyed larger rivals last quarter.

Reilly, the E.P.A. administrator under the first President George Bush, described the level of meetings between Mr. Pruitt and industry executives as unusual.\u201cMy sense is there is almost nothing about this administration that is traditional,\u201d Mr. Reilly said. He said Mr. Pruitt\u2019s history of suing the E.P.A. should have prompted him to meet regularly with public health advocates and environmentalists.\u201cI would think he would feel a responsibility to bend over backward to show a sense of judicious impartiality,\u201d Mr. Reilly said.Mr. Pruitt also has made frequent, government-funded trips to his home state of Oklahoma, even when the journeys included only a bit of official business. A trip to Oklahoma on May 5, which cost $1,043, was justified by the E.P.A. as an \u201cinformational meeting.\u201d It consisted of a one-hour sit-down that Friday with Sam Wade, the chief executive of the National Rural Water Association, then a return flight to Washington the following Monday.The Environmental Protection Agency late last week released a detailed accounting of Scott Pruitt's daily events for the first three months of his tenure.But many of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s trips outside Washington, the records show, also involved speeches to industry groups and conservative activists who worked closely with the energy industry to challenge the Obama administration\u2019s regulatory agenda.But the documents show Ms. McCarthy apparently spent much more time meeting with E.P.A. professional staff and other federal government officials than Mr. Pruitt, discussing agency programs and policies. She also met with industry players, like the American Gas Association, the National Pork Producers Council and Edison Electric Institute, the utility lobby.One of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s first scheduled meetings with a public health advocacy group, according to the calendar, came on May 24 when he sat down with the American Academy of Pediatrics.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Fastest-Growing Economy Could Be Headed for Trouble", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUCHAREST \u2014 Somewhere inside the vast shopping mall \u2014 beneath the roller coaster, across from the IMAX theater and down the corridor from the electronic casino \u2014 Anca Mariana Petculescu spotted an appealing pair of black leather boots.She remembered her credit card debt. She recalled the expensive repairs needed on the heating system at her apartment. Then she thought of the extra 500 lei \u2014 about $130 \u2014 the government had just added to her monthly pension. She bought the boots.\u201cShopping is like my therapy,\u201d said Ms. Petculescu, 64, who retired five years ago from her accounting job at a state-owned telephone company. \u201cTo feel good, I buy.\u201dThe inclinations of this retiree at the AFI Cotroceni mall help explain why Romania is the fastest-growing economy in Europe. In the first half of the year, it expanded at a blistering 5.8 percent pace compared with the same period a year earlier.Given that Romania is one of Europe\u2019s poorest nations, still recovering from the kleptocratic excesses of the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, this performance has resonated as affirmation of a bright new era. It has underscored the reinvigoration of Europe, now finally growing after years of crisis.Yet the scene at the mall also illustrates why many economists are pessimistic that Romania\u2019s fortunes can continue to improve \u2014 and why some fret that the next crisis in Europe is already taking shape. Much of the growth Romania has experienced is the product of a consumer bonanza \u2014 one financed by public sector raises handed out by a government whose populist generosity is pressing the killjoy limits of arithmetic.To pay for wage hikes, the government has been cutting spending on investment for highways and other public works \u2014 a decision not unlike withholding a child\u2019s college tuition to finance a new swimming pool. Romania\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure has long limited commerce. The fear is that pay raises plus tax cuts have generated a momentary jolt of economic activity that will leave the country indebted.\u201cWe are making the same mistakes as Greece,\u201d said Cristian Paun, an economist at Bucharest University of Economic Studies. \u201cWe are still continuing to increase the public debt when we are in a boom.\u201dFor now, any comparison to Greece, the most extreme example of an economy wrecked by unrestrained government largess, stretches credulity. At the end of last year, Romania\u2019s public debt was about 39 percent of its annual economic output, a fraction of the ratio for the United States (74 percent), Britain (92 percent) or Greece (182 percent).Still, Romania\u2019s public debt has roughly doubled over the last two decades. \u201cThis is very dangerous,\u201d Mr. Paun said. \u201cWhen the crisis comes again, as it inevitably will, we are exposed.\u201dThe government is facing pressure to improve living standards. Lifting wages is one way to do it. \u201cWe\u2019re making a lot of progress,\u201d said Andrei Pop, a member of Parliament who is part of the governing Social Democratic Party. \u201cThis growth is sustainable.\u201d\u201cIt cannot end well,\u201d said Senator Florin Citu, a member of the opposition National Liberal Party, and a former chief economist for Romania at the investment bank ING. \u201cIt\u2019s going to explode in our faces.\u201dEven union leaders say the government is handing out money absent a serious strategy.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that wages had to be increased, but not like this,\u201d said Bogdan Iuliu Hossu, president of the National Trade Union Confederation (Cartel Alfa), which represents some 600,000 Romanian workers \u2014 among them teachers, police officers and civil servants.This year alone, he said, the government has decreed more than a dozen raises. It lifted the minimum wage for all workers by about 16 percent to approximately 8.375 lei an hour (about $2.18). Then, medical workers received 25 percent increases. The entire public sector is due another 25 percent bump in January.\u201cThe government gives money to the chosen people,\u201d Mr. Hossu said.Romania has sought to amplify economic growth by courting foreign investment. The effort has been enhanced by an assault on official corruption undertaken by an agency created more than a decade ago, as part of Romania\u2019s successful campaign to join the European Union.Operating out of a fortresslike building that served as a military headquarters during World War II, prosecutors at the National Anticorruption Directorate have convicted ministers, members of Parliament and even a sitting prime minister.But in recent months, the government has sought to weaken anticorruption laws. In January, it barred prosecution for corruption involving sums less than about $50,000. Enraged citizens took to the streets, and the decree was rescinded. But fresh drafts of legislation could constrain prosecutors and judges anew.\u201cThere are moments when the political will shows us that there is no intention, there is no real wish to eradicate corruption,\u201d said the directorate\u2019s chief prosecutor, Laura Codruta Kovesi. \u201cThere is a real assault against the justice system.\u201dOver the first seven months of the year, incoming foreign investment plunged more than 17 percent, according to the Romanian central bank. If worries about corruption are a factor, the sudden turn of money also speaks to a sense of befuddlement as the government seeks money to finance its wage increases.In recent weeks, the government has outlined plans to force state-owned companies to hand over their cash reserves. In a contentious move, it has proposed shifting pension funds to shore up those for older workers.\u201cThey keep saying things, they keep adjusting,\u201d said Dragos Neacsu, chief executive officer of the Romanian branch of Erste Asset Management, an Austria-based investment fund manager. \u201cIt\u2019s like they are musical producers trying out different versions of the song before they know what to play.\u201dAs local entrepreneurs convened for a recent networking breakfast, many fretted over the government\u2019s plans for an accounting change that would force companies to manage separate accounts for taxes \u2014 a measure they said would sow chaos. They wondered how to make investment decisions in light of perpetual uncertainty over wages.\u201cThey are making our lives miserable,\u201d said Mona Mirea, an insurance broker. \u201cIt feels like we are heading into another crisis.\u201dThis year alone, the government has tweaked the tax code 22 times, complained Valentina Saygo, an accountant. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said.Among the biggest concerns is what the government is not doing \u2014 upgrading and expanding Romania\u2019s notoriously awful infrastructure.Noriel, a Romanian toy company bought last year by a Polish and American private equity fund, has expanded from 46 shops nationwide to 60. Yet Noriel would be expanding even faster if the highways were better, said its chief executive officer, Marek Maciejko.The company designs its toys in Romania and manufactures them in China. They are shipped to a port on the Black Sea, then trucked to Bucharest. But getting toys to Noriel\u2019s stores in Timisoara \u2014 a city some 340 miles to the west \u2014 can take two days in winter, on one-lane highways.\u201cThe lack of infrastructure has an impact on our business,\u201d Mr. Maciejko said.Sorin Popa curses the highways, too. He grows lettuce in greenhouses in a village outside Bucharest, farming the same land that his father and grandfather did.Back in the Communist era, the family took whatever price the state offered for its crops. They huddled around a wood fireplace for warmth. Today, gas heat filters through their home, which glows with televisions. They sell their crop to national supermarket chains, a sign of Romania\u2019s progress.But getting their crop to the distribution center, only 28 miles away, can take more than two hours.\u201cWe don\u2019t like it at all,\u201d Mr. Popa said. \u201cIt\u2019s keeping us from our work.\u201dFor now, many are too busy reveling in these bountiful times to worry about what comes next.On a recent afternoon at the AFI mall, Claudiu Vacarus, a bar manager, surveyed new smartphones. He had just returned from several months of working in London. He planned to stay.\u201cNow is the moment to create something in my country,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Chieftain of Spite", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt must be cold and miserable standing in the shadow of someone greater and smarter, more loved and more admired. It must be infuriating to have risen on the wings of your derision of that person\u2019s every decision, and even his very existence, and yet not be able to measure up \u2014 in either stratagem or efficacy \u2014 when you sit where that person once sat.This is the existence of Donald Trump in the wake of President Barack Obama. Trump can\u2019t hold a candle to Obama, so he\u2019s taking a tiki torch to Obama\u2019s legacy. Trump can\u2019t get his bad ideas through Congress, but he can use the power of the presidency to sabotage or even sink Obama\u2019s signature deeds.In fact, if there is a defining feature of Trump as \u201cpresident,\u201d it is that he is in all ways the anti-Obama \u2014 not only on policy but also on matters of propriety and polish. While Obama was erudite, Trump is ignorant. Obama was civil, Trump is churlish. Obama was tactful, Trump is tacky.There is a thing present in Obama and absent from Trump that no amount of money or power can alter: a sense of elegant intellectualism and taste.The example Obama set makes the big man with the big mouth look smaller by the day. But I believe that this nonadjustable imbalance is part of what has always fueled Trump\u2019s rage against Obama. Trump, who sees character as just another malleable thing that can be marketed and made salable, chafes at the black man who operated above the coarseness of commercial interests and whose character appeared unassailable.All of this feeds Trump\u2019s consuming obsession with undoing everything Obama did. It is his personal crusade, but he also carries the flag for the millions of Americans \u2014 mostly all Republicans \u2014 who were reflexively repulsed by Obama and the coalition that elected him.Trump has done nearly everything in his power to roll back Obama\u2019s policies, but none are as tempting a target as the one named after him: Obamacare.Republicans \u2014 including Trump \u2014 campaigned for years on a lie. They knew it was a lie, but it was an enraging one that excited their base: Obama was destroying America\u2019s health care system, but Republicans could undo the damage and replace it with their own, better bill.First, Obama wasn\u2019t destroying America\u2019s health care system. To the contrary, he simply sought to make it cover more people. He moved to take American health care in a more humane, modern and civilized direction, to make it more universally accessible, even by the sick and poor who often took its absence as a given.Second, the Republicans had no replacement plan that would cost less and cover as many or more people. That could not be done. So, their repeal-and-replace efforts failed. But that also meant that Trump\u2019s promise was proven a lie. Trump has no problem lying, but in the end he wants his lies to look plausible.Trump makes assertions for which there is no evidence \u2014 either knowingly lying, recklessly boasting or wishfully thinking \u2014 then seeks support for those statements, support that is often lacking because the statements are baseless.He violates a basic protocol of human communication: Be sure of it before you say it. His way is to say something wrong, then bend reality to make it appear right. This is why the age of Trump is so maddening and stupefying: He is warping reality.Furthermore, six in 10 Americans believe Congress should guarantee cost-sharing reduction payments, as opposed to only a third who view these payments as a \u201cbailout of insurance companies,\u201d as Trump has called them. There is no real reason to cut these payments, other than to save face and conceal the farce.Trump isn\u2019t governing with a vision, he\u2019s governing out of spite. Obama\u2019s effectiveness highlights Trump\u2019s ineptitude, and this incenses Trump.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U., Citing Amazon and Apple, Tells Nations to Collect Tax", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European competition regulators on Wednesday mounted a push against tax avoidance by Silicon Valley giants, announcing plans to take Ireland to court for failing to collect back taxes from Apple and ordering Luxembourg to claim unpaid taxes from Amazon.Officials in Europe have been particularly focused on flexing their regulatory muscles against American technology companies, including assessing penalties for antitrust violations and opening investigations into the mishandling of customer data.Critics have argued that the measures show that the European Union is unfairly targeting such companies \u2014 an accusation that officials in Europe deny.The moves to address tax avoidance have special resonance in the region, much of which has endured painful austerity measures stemming from the financial crisis. Opponents of those measures complain that big companies have skirted their tax obligations, leaving small firms and individuals to make up the difference.European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.A year later, \u201cIreland has not recovered any money, not even in part,\u201d she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid \u201cmore conflictual waters,\u201d a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.At the time of the ruling, Europe\u2019s competition watchdogs said that Apple\u2019s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\u201dThe Irish Department of Finance said that it \u201chas never accepted the commission\u2019s analysis\u201d in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager\u2019s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had \u201cmade significant progress on this complex issue\u201d and accused the European authorities of taking a \u201cwholly unnecessary step.\u201dApple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had \u201cno valid economic justification\u201d and that the company had been able to \u201cavoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.\u201dAmazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.\u201cWe believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it \u201cpaid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\u201dAmazon said it would study the commission\u2019s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to \u201cillegal state aid.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. \u201cThe main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.\u201dA broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.\u201cThere are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,\u201d Mr. Fuest said.The European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc\u2019s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Old-School Investment Manager That Builds Wealth Quietly", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySan Francisco \u2014 In the hard-sell world of mutual funds, the art of pushing pricey investments is a source of pride for many executives.Not at Dodge & Cox.The old-school investment firm does virtually nothing to promote or market its six modestly priced, actively-managed mutual funds.To underscore his point, Mr. Pohl described a recent encounter with an executive from a rival fund company, whom he declined to identify. Mr. Pohl\u2019s peer proudly described the way that new technology allowed him to track, in real time, how its vast portfolio of mutual funds, and their many share classes, were selling across the country.Mr. Pohl was unimpressed.\u201cWe have no idea about this,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBut if you give me enough time I think I can name every single issuer of a bond or equity that we own.\u201dMr. Pohl did not rattle off the names of the 164 companies that Dodge & Cox, which manages $303 billion in assets, oversees in its portfolios. He was, however, quick to highlight the simplicity, parsimoniousness and devotion to disciplined value investing that distinguishes this traditionally minded investment firm from much of its industry.Founded in 1930 by two Depression-era bankers, Dodge & Cox has just six, single-class mutual funds, compared with an average of 464 for the largest 25 fund shops, according to Morningstar. Its fees are about half the industry average, Morningstar says. It has no sales force and says it has never paid to advertise its small stable of funds.If the indexing giant Vanguard were reincarnated as a pure stock-picking outfit, it might look a lot like Dodge & Cox: lean, cheap and not a little holier than thou.For years, fund companies that rely on active stock selection to churn out returns have been pummeled by investors switching over to lower-cost, better-performing index and exchange-traded funds. The portfolio managers at Dodge & Cox, stock pickers to their very core, have not been immune to these industry-shaking trends.Investors have been less than patient with such results. Since 2012, the Dodge & Cox Stock fund has had close to $10 billion in outflows, although the firm\u2019s other funds have had net inflows during that time.The Dodge & Cox Stock fund\u2019s five-year performance has been better. While many large capitalization mutual funds have struggled to keep pace with the surging Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which returned 14.2 percent, annualized, through September, Dodge & Cox Stock was up 15.6 percent, according to Morningstar. That put the fund in the top 2 percent of its category.While other fund companies with an active \u2014 as opposed to an index-based, or passive \u2014 investing bias are wrestling with their missions, contemplating mergers or exploring ways to use index-tracking exchange-traded funds to attract new investors, Dodge & Cox is staying true to its principles.At the root of those principles is a Vanguard-like aversion to spending money. Despite having $100 billion parked in stocks and bonds that trade in overseas markets, the company has no investment offices in Europe or Asia. In addition to doing no advertising, the firm has no public relations office and no sales force.A glance at employees\u2019 business cards highlights this self-effacing culture. Mr. Pohl and Dana M. Emery, the firm\u2019s chief executive, hand out cards free of any reference to title or position \u2014 an oddity in the status conscious world of finance.Executives at the firm insisted that there was a method to the madness: investors reaping better returns from lower fees on Dodge funds.For example: According to Morningstar, the 0.52 fee levied on the Dodge & Cox Stock fund is half the price of the average large stock fund, which charges about 1.07 percent to investors these days.\u201cThe fee differential is unique,\u201d said Andrew Daniels, an analyst at Morningstar who covers the firm\u2019s main fund, Dodge & Cox Stock. He added: \u201cTheir interests are aligned with fund holders, and, for how strong a fund this is, it\u2019s one of the cheapest active funds that you can buy.\u201dDodge & Cox is, in many ways, a throwback to a much earlier time, before mutual fund companies went public and before the now departed era when hot shot portfolio managers graced the covers of glossy magazines. Its first offering, the Balanced Fund, was established in 1931.Since then, generations of top managers have resisted the urge to sell their shares in an initial public offering. And while many firms brag about low manager turnover, few can match Dodge & Cox\u2019s numbers.Mr. Pohl, 59, has been chairman since 2013. He and Ms. Emery, who is in charge of fixed-income investing, preside over the firm\u2019s investment committee and also share operational responsibilities. He has spent 33 years at the firm; she has been there for 34.It is not uncommon for people to stay at Dodge & Cox for a long time. One of the firm\u2019s founders, E. Morris Cox, who died in 2003, came into the office regularly when he was well into his 90s. These days, the average firm tenure for all of its portfolio managers is 19 years. At the 25 largest fund families, the comparable figure is just over 8 years, according to Morningstar.Mr. Daniels cited two factors in particular that allowed the firm to keep its fees down.\u201cThey really eat their own cooking,\u201d Mr. Daniels said.Mr. Pohl, the Dodge & Cox chairman, said his company\u2019s methods enabled it to excel.\u201cWe are after a different customer,\u201d he said, \u201csomeone who does not have to read an ad or have a broker call them. And in return they get a lower fee and a better long-term return.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz: A Pressure Point for North Korea", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIt used to be \u2014 and the story behind the decision to remove that designation nearly 10 years ago is the key to understanding America\u2019s failed assumptions about North Korea, how they led to Pyongyang obtaining its nuclear arsenal, and why the United States needs to reverse its approach and relist Pyongyang immediately.Aside from the many stringent limitations a terrorism-sponsor designation imposes on a state, the label serves as a formal indication from the United States that any positive development of diplomatic relations is contingent on abandoning the financing and support of terrorism.Indeed, the State Department linked Pyongyang\u2019s ties to terrorist groups and its nuclear program as a rationale for maintaining the terror designation in 2005. Two years later, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor believed to have been built with North Korean help in Syria, a designated state sponsor of terrorism. Although all this was understood at the time, the United States elected to delist North Korea in 2008 \u2014 and in so doing, again fell back into its pattern of misunderstanding rogue regimes.When North Korea reneged on its promise to forgo nuclear weapons in the early 1990s, President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration put together the \u201cAgreed Framework\u201d that paved Pyongyang\u2019s path to nuclearization. When North Korea\u2019s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003, confirming that he intended to build a nuclear weapon, President George W. Bush pushed for the China-led six-party talks with North Korea. When the country tested its second nuclear weapon in 2009, President Barack Obama opted for \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d Three subsequent tests showed just how misguided this was.It is time to acknowledge that North Korea may never be interested in negotiating away its nuclear deterrent. Of course we should continue to leave the door open for serious discussions if the situation changes, but the United States government does our citizens \u2014 and the world \u2014 a disservice if it continually discounts the centrality of nuclear weapons to the Kim regime.They are not a mere insurance policy for survival. They are a means to a more sweeping end: reunification of the Korean Peninsula on Pyongyang\u2019s terms. We must seriously consider the possibility that the North\u2019s current leader, Kim Jong-un, is preparing to use nuclear weapons to drive American forces out of South Korea and coerce Seoul \u2014 even at the risk of fighting a limited nuclear war.Given this, the United States must approach North Korea with sobriety and urgency. The Trump administration has the opportunity to join both houses of Congress in acknowledging the truth about North Korea and using it to open new opportunities to maximize pressure.Among North Korea\u2019s many significant forms of illicit financing are foreign slave labor and money laundering. From Africa to Europe, North Korean diplomats exploit their consular posts to launder money at the expense of international comity. If North Korea is relisted, these nations would face a significant decision: Is continuing diplomatic and economic relations with a state that uses diplomacy and finance to export and foment terrorism in their interest?It would pose an even deeper question to the United States: Will we continue our diplomatic overtures to the Kim regime on the flawed assumption that it is interested in a future without nuclear weapons? It is because of America\u2019s bipartisan belief in North Korea\u2019s potential amenity in a political settlement, captured in the 2008 delisting, that North Korea can now marry a miniaturized warhead to an intercontinental ballistic missile. Relisting Pyongyang is the first step toward a strategic vision based on facts rather than aspirations.We must tell the truth about the dangerous ambitions of North Korea and once again list it as a state sponsor of terrorism, a move that only strengthens our hand and weakens that of Kim Jong-un. I strongly urge the State Department to relist North Korea, and to meet this challenge with the resolve it has long demanded.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The High Cost of Not Talking About Money", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfWant to know how tough is it for many Americans to talk about their financial concerns?About as tough as any topic you can imagine. Kathleen Burns Kingsbury lays it on the line in her new book, \u201cBreaking Money Silence (Praeger, $37).\u201cAlmost half of Americans say that the most difficult topic to discuss with others is personal finance and they would rather discuss death, politics or religion\u201d she writes in the book\u2019s opening lines. \u201cTake a minute to let that information sink in,\u201d she continues. \u201cMany people would rather discuss dying than finances.\u201dMs. Kingsbury, a financial services industry consultant, explains the goal of her book in her subtitle: \u201cHow to Shatter Money Taboos, Talk More Openly About Finances and Live a Richer Life.\u201dIt\u2019s a worthwhile objective, even if she stumbles occasionally. More on that later, but first the good news.Ms. Kingsbury forces you to think about several things that are important to achieving financial health, starting with the phrase that comprises part of her title \u201cmoney silence,\u201d her term for someone\u2019s refusal to talk and ask questions about personal finance.She scatters explanations throughout the book for why the sounds of (financial) silence might occur.They range from embarrassment \u2014 people may be reluctant to talk about money because they are ashamed that they haven\u2019t saved enough, or that they don\u2019t know much about personal finance and so they don\u2019t want to ask \u201cdumb\u201d questions \u2014 to relationship discord. If one person is a spender and another is not, discussions can get heated when the credit card bill arrives, and so people avoid money discussions.There are more subtle reasons as well. Parents who are struggling financially may not want their adult children to know about their financial woes, for example, so they keep quiet and that may create ambivalence. If you aren\u2019t sure how you really feel about money \u2014 Is it the root of all evil, as some people believe, or a potential force for good in your life and the lives of others? \u2014 you may not want to think about it.All this is on top of what Ms. Kingsbury believes is the biggest reason for money silence: misplaced propriety. Some people feel it is simply wrong to talk about their personal finances, even if they need help \u2014 or can help someone else.You can understand any or all of those reactions, but none of them are helpful to your overall financial health.Curating the research on the nonfinancial part of personal finance is where she shines.And she is also good on basic advice.She says, for example, that \u201cmoney compatibility is an important factor to consider in a romantic relationship,\u201d going further by suggesting questions you could ask a potential partner early on. A representative query is: \u201cHow much financial autonomy do you want in the relationship?\u201dUnfortunately, as Ms. Kingsbury is laying all this out, she has a tendency to get in her own way.References to personal experience are often helpful, but the constant examples in this book from the author\u2019s own life are distracting. We read multiple times about her husband\u2019s previous financial missteps. And in an attempt to emphasize the importance of her topic she tends to make unsupported, and hyperbolic, statements, such as claiming that a reluctance to talk about money is \u201cbankrupting businesses and making it almost impossible for the next generation to be healthy around money.\u201dShe also tends to repeat herself. You can find a variation on her excellent opening quote about money just six pages later, and her seemingly constant mention of her previous books gets annoying.It is difficult to learn about a topic unless you are willing to ask questions. If Ms. Kingsbury\u2019s book encourages people to engage and seek more information, it will have performed a valuable service.Advertisement"}

Others were accused of using forged placards for nongovernmental organizations, which included the American Red Cross and the New York Blood Center.One defendant was accused of parking his Mercedes with a phony Law Department placard in a space reserved for an ambulette that transported people with disabilities to a health care facility, investigators said. Another defendant was accused of using a fake placard while he was attending the city\u2019s academy for new correction officers.Five were accused of using handicapped zone passes, and three were charged with submitting copies of their fake placards to the city\u2019s Department of Finance to avoid paying parking tickets. Several were also arrested on charges they used phony placards to park in loading zones for commercial drivers.\u201cWhen someone uses a fraudulent placard like this it\u2019s as though they are stealing city resources,\u201d said Mark G. Peters, the city commissioner of the Department of Investigation.Mr. Peters said the forged placards cost between $500 and $2,600 on the black market and the demand for them was high, spawning an underground industry. Last week, city investigators arrested Mahmoud Jeaidi, 21, on charges he manufactured a fake Law Department placard and sold it to an undercover officer for $1,200.Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said the arrests were meant to send a message. The defendants, who turned themselves in on Tuesday morning, were brought into State Supreme Court in Manhattan in handcuffs and in front of television cameras.Twenty-three were charged with second-degree criminal impersonation, a misdemeanor with a penalty of up to a year in jail; four were charged with second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument, a felony; and three were charged with first-degree offering a false instrument, also a felony.All of the defendants pleaded not guilty, and Justice Maxwell Wiley ordered them released without bail. None of them would comment on the charges as they left the courthouse.Gregory Esposito, a defense lawyer for one of the men, Andrej Bogdanovs, said the public humiliation was \u201ca bit much.\u201d\u201cWhether true or not, it\u2019s not the crime of the century,\u201d he said. He predicted the evidence would show some of the placards were used legitimately.City-issued parking placards allow the bearers to park in designated zones. There are about 160,000 in circulation, with about 114,000 of those issued to city employees.He also said he would create an office within the city\u2019s Education Department dedicated to handling complaints about placards to discipline staff members who misuse them.The arrests on Tuesday, however, were the result of a joint investigation by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation and the Manhattan district attorney. None of the defendants were city employees, Mr. Peters said. A third of them lived in the suburbs, and several drove luxury cars, including a Rolls-Royce, a BMW and a Range Rover, officials said.\u201cA lot of the people arrested had very expensive, fancy cars and they were essentially stealing resources from New Yorkers with disabilities and others who need city resources,\u201d Mr. Peters said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scrambling to Fix the Subway: Slow Progress, but Much Work Remains", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn data to be released this week, the transportation authority said it would show that it is working toward meeting year-end goals regarding inspections and repairs at key points in the vast system. Mechanical failures have also declined in recent weeks, though officials were unable to provide precise figures.\u201cThink of it like a patient that has suffered severe trauma,\u201d said Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the transportation authority. The first thing that needs to be done is to stabilize the patient, he said, and stop the bleeding. But officials said the bigger aim by early next year was to return service to the pre-crisis level, which would require reducing the number of major incidents by 40 percent. A major incident is defined as a problem that causes the delay of more than 50 trains. At the height of the crisis, there were more than 80 major incidents on average a month.Those efforts, however, Mr. Lhota warned, could be jeopardized by an ongoing fight with City Hall over funding. The state agreed to pay half the cost of the emergency plan and said the city should pay the other half. Mr. Lhota said if the city does not contribute, the agency would have to stop hiring new workers in January. Officials said that 764 workers have been hired and they want to hire at least 1,600 more.\u201cWe are on the cusp of restoring reliability back into the N.Y.C. subway system for the first time in quite a while and it would be a tragedy if this successful endeavor was derailed because of a lack of funding,\u201d said John Samuelsen, the president of the International Transit Workers Union.But city officials bristled at the state\u2019s continued criticism over subway financing. \u201cCity riders are sick of this charade,\u201d said Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cFunding half of their responsibility isn\u2019t an option and holding hostage the completion of the plan is only going to hurt riders.\u201dFor riders, the best measure of success is on-time performance. But because there is a two-month lag in posting data, the most recent numbers are from August, which showed the same low on-time performance that had plagued the system for months, and transit officials said that it would not be a fair measure of their efforts.\u201cIt\u2019s nonstop pressure for the workers and contractors to get as much done as possible,\u201d Mr. Lhota said. \u201cFrom a mechanical aspect, I am feeling much better off.\u201d\u201cThe measure of success shouldn\u2019t be whether the subway system is in meltdown mode on a given day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be whether people leave home in the morning with a reliable sense of when they will get to work, and that is not yet happening. There haven\u2019t been as many meltdowns in the last few weeks, but there remains a low-grade sense of dread among riders that any day could be the day that subway delays upend everyone\u2019s lives again.\u201dMr. Raskin said the renewed focus on maintenance at the core of the emergency plan was a good stopgap solution, but it was not a substitute for a long-term plan.\u201cIf we don\u2019t follow up with a new signal system and new cars and other investments, we\u2019ll be in crisis mode again and again,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo announced the emergency plan after months of constant disruptions and coverage by The New York Times about the decrepit state of the subway, including its fragile signal system and increasingly malfunctioning trains, and the escalating financial cost to riders.Despite some recent improvements, the sprawling system\u2019s archaic infrastructure poses a constant challenge. Last Monday, at the height of the morning rush, a signal light failed at the Rockefeller Center station.All the while, the effects ripple outward, stranding riders far from where the trouble began.\u201cWhen a signal goes out, you can have trains backed up from Manhattan to Canarsie,\u201d said Paul Pietrofeso, the general superintendent in the signals department. On that Monday morning, the signal problems in Midtown Manhattan delayed riders on eight subway lines.Even without breakdowns, the amount of work it takes every day to keep the trains running on the fraying system is staggering.Over the course of one recent weeknight, workers removed 41,800 pounds of scrap debris, vacuumed 17,035 feet of track, cleared 1,310 feet of drain pipes, emptied 20 drain boxes, worked on 574 signal components, performed maintenance work on 175 switch components and 2,551 track components, scraped gunk off 425 feet of track and made two serious structural repairs to steel components.Mr. Pietrofeso, a 30-year veteran of the transit system, knows well the challenges of trying to operate trains on outdated infrastructure. \u201cWe are like the fire department of the subway system,\u201d he said, referring to his signal workers.On the recent weeknight, his shift began by checking on the work of a crew replacing what is known as a subway stop on the E line at 53rd and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. A stop is an iron arm that rises on the tracks after a train has passed through a station to ensure that another train behind it does not hit the train in front.There are more than 4,000 stops in the system. Hundreds of them are more than 50 years old. Nearly every night, a stop is being replaced somewhere.With so much work needing to be done, it is not possible to stop train traffic for every repair or replacement. So on this night, a half-dozen transit workers labored for 10 minutes at a time, climbing off the tracks every time a train rumbled into the station.Bishwadyal Singh, 53, the supervisor on the job, said it would take at least six hours to get the old stop arm out and replace it with a new one.The subway emergency plan targets the things that cause the vast majority of delays in the system, such as signal malfunctions, track issues, failing power infrastructure, water-related damage and corrosion, track fires, car breakdowns, police emergencies and station problems.The second phase of the plan focuses more on long-term needs and capital improvement.Most of the work is done under something known as a general work order that requires a section of track or a station to be closed overnight.\u201cThe amount of productive time on a general order has been an intractable problem at the M.T.A. for decades,\u201d said Patrick J. Foye, the president of the transportation authority.Mr. Foye said one change was to extend the time a station was closed to maximize the work. In the past, work would start at midnight. Now, it begins at 10 p.m.Dozens of workers assigned different jobs fanned out across the tracks, guided by flashlights. Some were equipped with yellow shovels and scooped up trash. By 5 a.m., they would collect more than a ton of garbage in a small section about the length of the platform, off the tracks at the station.Viorel Serban was part of the team examining the interlocking mechanism, which houses the equipment that controls signals.If that mechanism, which moves after a train passes over it, is even a quarter of an inch misaligned, train traffic can come to a stop.\u201cAlmost every night we find a problem,\u201d Mr. Serban said. Once again, trash is the enemy. Something as simple as a soda can caught in the switch can gunk up the system and cause a shutdown.Sergey Gayduk was part of the lubrication team, responsible for checking that the tracks were properly greased. When a train passes over an oil greaser, it depresses a release that squirts oil on the rail.Other teams were inspecting rails and power issues.As the 5 a.m. deadline neared, another crew was making a final check of the switches at the station. One switch was scheduled to be replaced in the next two weeks.That job would require replacing hundreds of feet of rail, a crane to lift the large device and dozens of workers who would need at least 53 hours to get the job done. The station would have to be shut for that whole time.\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated dance,\u201d Mr. Pietrofeso said. \u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say it was a challenge sometimes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senators Demand Online Ad Disclosures as Tech Lobby Mobilizes", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain and two Democratic senators moved on Thursday to force Facebook, Google and other internet companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, after revelations that Russian-linked operatives bought deceptive ads in the run-up to the 2016 election with no disclosure required.But the tech industry, which has worked to thwart previous efforts to mandate such disclosure, is mobilizing an army of lobbyists and lawyers \u2014 including a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2014 to help shape proposed regulations. Long before the 2016 election, the adviser, Marc E. Elias, helped Facebook and Google request exemptions from the Federal Election Commission to existing disclosure rules, arguing that ads on the respective platforms were too small to fit disclaimers listing their sponsors.Now Mr. Elias\u2019s high-powered Democratic election law firm, Perkins Coie, is helping the companies navigate legal and regulatory issues arising from scrutiny of the Russian-linked ads, which critics say might have been flagged by the disclaimers. In a two-front war, tech companies are targeting an election commission rule-making process that was restarted last month and a legislative effort in the Senate.\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you they support this bill right now,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and the lead author of the proposed Honest Ads Act.But she and her co-author, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, urged the social media companies to take greater responsibility for the content that lands on their sites, including political ads and other content meant to sow discord or chaos. With Facebook and Google alone capturing an estimated 85 percent of all digital political ads, self-policing won\u2019t cut it, they said.\u201cThey have to realize the world has changed,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.Federal election law bars foreigners from spending money to try to influence United States elections.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served on the election commission from 2013 until this year. \u201cWe need to rethink all the exemptions for the internet because even if Facebook might not have known about the Russian advertising, they knew \u2014 and we all knew \u2014 that this was possible.\u201dThe new bill would require internet companies to provide information to the election commission about who is paying for online ads.The content and purchasers of the Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook and Google in 2016 \u201care a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Warner said.Yet government officials working on the investigations into the Russian-funded ads and the efforts to enact stricter disclosure requirements say Facebook and Google have been less than enthusiastic partners.And in the weeks leading up to the introduction of the Klobuchar-Warner-McCain bill, Facebook told congressional aides that it is too difficult to figure out if an ad is political or commercial because candidates are often changing messages and topics. The company added that with the sheer number of ads on the site, the engineering involved in identifying political ads would be extremely challenging.Around that time, both companies paid Perkins Coie to seek exemptions from the election commission to one of the few election rules that do apply to online political activity \u2014 that political ads placed on third-party websites contain disclaimers revealing who paid for them. The exemption requests, written by Mr. Elias, the head of Perkins Coie\u2019s political law practice, argued that it was impractical to require disclaimers on ads the size of those then being offered on Google and Facebook.Such disclaimers and other disclosure requirements might have helped deter the Russian-funded ads and other online efforts to meddle in the election, say advocates for stricter campaign finance rules. Mr. Elias went on to help lead research into Russian efforts to help Donald J. Trump and damage Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.It was \u201ckind of like the chickens coming home to roost,\u201d said Ms. Ravel, the former commissioner.She argued that since Facebook was not granted an exemption to the disclaimer requirements, it should have required advertisements to include disclaimers for the past half-dozen years. But referring to Mr. Elias, she said that \u201cthe savvy political insiders understand that there is not going to be any enforcement from the F.E.C.\u201d because the commission has frequently deadlocked along partisan lines over enforcement matters in recent years.Mr. Elias rejected suggestions that he helped Russia hurt Mrs. Clinton.\u201cRussia found a number of ways to aid Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, and the F.E.C. disclaimers would not have stopped them,\u201d he said. The ads in question would not have required the disclaimers, he said, because \u2014 according to Facebook \u2014 they did not explicitly mention Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton or the election. In a blog post, Facebook wrote that the ads focused on amplifying \u201cdivisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201dCiting United States intelligence findings that Russia was behind the hacking and dissemination of damaging emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Mr. Elias said, \u201cThe Russians were willing to break the law to help Donald Trump. I doubt the F.E.C. disclaimers were going to be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201dCritics are not accepting that. Google and Facebook had ample opportunity to work with the Federal Election Commission to devise and put in place effective and practical disclaimer rules, \u201cbut they were silent,\u201d said Lawrence M. Noble, a former general counsel for the election commission who now serves in that position with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that pushes for stricter rules governing money in politics.\u201cAnd they are still trying to avoid regulation,\u201d Mr. Noble said.A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.And the company\u2019s vice president for United States public policy, Erin Egan, said, \u201cWe look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution\u201d to \u201cachieve transparency in political advertising.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weinstein Company Will Not Get Planned Cash Infusion", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut those plans have changed. Colony has not and will not provide a cash infusion, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Wednesday to discuss private deliberations. It was unclear why the preliminary agreement had fallen apart.Colony, which has experience in distressed Hollywood assets, continues to explore the purchase of some or all of the Weinstein Company\u2019s assets. But Colony found more disorder than it had expected \u2014 and less value \u2014 once it started closely examining the studio\u2019s assets, according to two people who were briefed on the matter. They added that Colony saw bankruptcy as the most likely near-term outcome for the studio.Representatives for Colony and the Weinstein Company declined to comment.The Weinstein Company still has options. Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that has lent money to beleaguered film companies in the past, has been working on a potential financing package for the studio valued at roughly $35 million, which would provide enough liquidity for the studio to operate roughly through January, according to three people briefed on the matter.In her complaint, Ms. Huett said Mr. Weinstein had lured her to a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2010 with a promise to discuss acting roles and instead forced her to engage in sex acts. A spokesman for the Weinstein Company did not respond to requests for comment on the suit on Wednesday.Adding to the complexity, \u201cno one is interested in salvaging a company which would benefit Harvey,\u201d Mr. Barrack said. In other words: Would it be possible to structure a sale so that Mr. Weinstein did not benefit financially? Mr. Weinstein owns roughly 20 percent of the studio. His brother, Bob, owns an identical share. The rest is owned by about 25 investors, who hold portions of varying sizes.Several major entertainment companies have looked at buying pieces of the Weinstein Company and come away with mixed to negative reactions, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Lionsgate had interest in only one of the studio\u2019s coming films, \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d which is set for release in January. But even that family sequel has limited potential; the Weinstein Company mainly holds domestic rights.Endeavor, which owns the William Morris Endeavor talent agency and the IMG sports and fashion business, took a look at the Weinstein Company to see if there was a way to protect clients who have projects in the works there. But it concluded that clients should instead use legal tactics to pry projects loose.The Endeavor-related projects include a film adaptation of the musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d created by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes; a documentary about President Trump by Michael Moore; and a planned adaptation of \u201cThe Boys in the Boat,\u201d Daniel James Brown\u2019s book about the American rowing team that won a gold medal at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.The studio has made inroads in television, selling series to the likes of Amazon and Viacom and lining up potential shows with Showtime and Apple.

{"Headline": "New Zealand to Be Led by Jacinda Ardern, 37, Returning Left to Power", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 A minor party holding the balance of power in New Zealand threw its support behind 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern\u2019s bid to become prime minister on Thursday, ending the center-right National Party\u2019s nine-year grip on power.Ms. Ardern, the leader of the Labour Party, will take over from Prime Minister Bill English, reversing Labour\u2019s long-flagging fortunes and giving the country its youngest leader in more than 150 years.Ms. Ardern said Thursday that she believed in building an economy that worked \u201cfor all New Zealanders\u201d while working to protect New Zealand\u2019s environment and clean up its waterways.The announcement that a coalition had been formed came after a tumultuous campaign in which the National Party won 56 seats \u2014 more than any other party \u2014 but failed to capture the 61 needed for a parliamentary majority to govern in New Zealand\u2019s political system.The close result set off a scramble between the two groups to win the favor of New Zealand First, a populist party that won nine seats \u2014 enough to put either National, or the Greens and Labour, over the line in forming a government.In the kingmaker position was New Zealand First\u2019s leader, Winston Peters, an eccentric veteran politician who has long campaigned on cuts to immigration, curtailing foreign ownership of New Zealand land, and securing pensions and other benefits for retirees, who make up a large percentage of the party\u2019s base of support.While those issues were not at the forefront of political debate ahead of the election, they were thrust front and center after the vote as both major parties spent the last month wooing Mr. Peters with policy proposals.Mr. Peters, 72, has been in this position twice before: once in 1996, in a coalition with National that fell apart two years later, and in a coalition with Labour in 2005. He has a famously truculent relationship with the news media and remained tight-lipped throughout the coalition negotiation process, leaving analysts speculating about whom he would anoint as prime minister.In throwing his support to Ms. Ardern, Mr. Peters said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for capitalism to regain its human face.\u201dThe New Zealand First leader kept the country guessing for weeks about whom he would support, keeping it secret until the minute he took to a podium at the Parliament building Thursday. He revealed he had told neither Ms. Ardern nor Mr. English of his decision before announcing it.During the campaign, she emphasized issues including child poverty, environmental management and housing affordability.The campaign was raucous, at least by the standards of New Zealand, a prosperous member of the Commonwealth that has largely been spared the divisive debate over migration that has roiled its larger neighbor, Australia.Before Ms. Ardern captured Labour\u2019s leadership, the party had cycled through five leaders since the last Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, lost the 2008 election. None of those leaders managed to cut into National\u2019s popularity \u2014 which was buoyed by New Zealand\u2019s strong economy \u2014 but Ms. Ardern\u2019s call for change and youthful energy invigorated her party, winning it new supporters.A headline with an earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Jacinda Ardern. As the article correctly noted, she will be New Zealand\u2019s youngest prime minister in more than 150 years, not its youngest ever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The G.O.P. Is a Mess. It\u2019s Not All Trump\u2019s Fault.", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIf the modern Republican Party can be said to stand for anything, it is tax relief. Yet as the Republican effort to write and pass tax legislation develops, it looks increasingly possible \u2014 and perhaps even likely \u2014 that it, like the health care overhaul attempt that preceded it, will end in failure and disappointment.It would be easy to simply blame the president for the party\u2019s disarray. Donald Trump\u2019s aversion to policy detail, his chaotic management style and his combustible personality have all contributed to the party\u2019s failures this year.Yet it would also be a mistake to pin the party\u2019s problems on Mr. Trump alone. He is not their root cause. Instead, he is an avatar of the party\u2019s pathologies, the culmination of its cynical and shambolic trajectory over the last two decades.Many of those issues can be traced back to the administration of George W. Bush, which functioned as an enormous political bait and switch. The 43rd president campaigned on humble foreign policy and prudent conservative solutions, but his presidency quickly became oriented almost exclusively around a political defense of the Iraq war.This meant that domestic policy, and the realm of domestic policy expertise, became an afterthought at best, an opportunity for cynical political maneuvering at worst.National security fear-mongering and culture war controversies, especially over same-sex marriage, were employed to rally the base and ensure its loyalty, even as dissatisfaction with Mr. Bush\u2019s governance continued to grow.The Bush presidency, then, was both a failure and a fraud. Instead of foreign policy restraint and modest conservative governance, the Bush administration delivered a pair of endless deficit-financed wars, cynical posturing over social issues, soaring federal spending and, eventually, a large-scale emergency intervention in the economy.Arguably as important as the particular failures themselves, however, was the way the party infrastructure \u2014 its leaders and functionaries, its activists and operators \u2014 formed a partisan phalanx around the president, playing down his flaws, if not refusing to acknowledge them.There is always some space between a party\u2019s voters and its leaders, some difference between what the average supporter wants and what the elected representatives are willing to do. But by excusing Mr. Bush\u2019s errors, Republicans radically expanded the trust deficit, creating a yawning gap between the party\u2019s base and its elites, one that has persisted, and grown, in the years since.In many ways the party\u2019s hangups stem from its unwillingness to fully reckon with the Bush legacy.Mr. Bush left many voters on the right angry, resentful and suspicious \u2014 of war, of policy, of ideology, of the very idea of political solutions and leadership.The focal point for much of the post-Bush right\u2019s anger and resentment was the Tea Party, a decentralized movement that variously mixed genuine desire for limited government with white resentment and flare-ups of outright paranoia. It attracted hucksters and manipulators, in the media and in the activist sphere, and embraced a cast of unconventional and unqualified candidates.Republican Party elites were only too happy to exploit this inchoate energy as long as it was useful. This is how John McCain ended up selecting an untested firebrand like Sarah Palin as his presidential running mate and how Mitt Romney campaigned with sideshow characters like Kid Rock and, well, eventually Donald Trump.The partisan push for the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama further amplified these frustrations, which helped Republicans take over the House in 2010.The defeats of both Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney left the party leaderless, and Mr. Bush\u2019s shredded reputation meant it could not follow the course he had laid out. So the party became defined by what was left: its resentments and suspicions, its antagonisms and obsessions, its anger and its differences. It retreated into tribalism and anti-intellectualism. Eventually, the sideshow became the main event.Mr. Trump, of course, is the biggest sideshow of them all. He exploited the gap between the base and the elites, embodying the dysfunction and disarray that already existed.Like all presidents, he serves an organizing function for his party, orienting it around broad goals. But Mr. Trump\u2019s goals have more to do with Twitter feuds and personal aggrandizement than any particular policies. Under Mr. Trump, the party\u2019s chief internal debate is not so much about which governing vision to pursue but whether there should be one at all.This reality is not lost on all Republicans. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, one of the party\u2019s most libertarian members, recently said that when he realized that primary voters backed him and his fellow libertarians Rand Paul and Ron Paul, it wasn\u2019t for their ideas. Instead, he said, \u201cthey were voting for the craziest son of a bitch in the race \u2014 and Donald Trump won best in class.\u201dRepublican voters weren\u2019t voting for any policy outcome. They were voting for chaos. And that, more than anything, is what the party has come to stand for.A more conventional Republican president might have smoothed over some of these intraparty conflicts, and almost certainly would have managed passing legislation with more skill. But the essential divisions would still have existed.For years before Mr. Trump was elected, Republicans lacked a consensus plan to replace Obamacare, and their tax reform plans were vague. Republicans blew up the deficit under Mr. Bush before complaining about it under Mr. Obama, and the party has fought bitter internal battles over immigration for decades.Republican voters, meanwhile, were attracted to shallow political entertainers and obviously unqualified candidates long before Mr. Trump threw his hat in the ring.Mr. Trump didn\u2019t cause any of this. He just took advantage of it. He is the most successful huckster of the bunch.While party leaders were quiet under Mr. Bush, some today seem willing to speak out, however haltingly, against Mr. Trump. Republicans would benefit from more of that sort of critical introspection, but it is not enough. Because someday, Mr. Trump will no longer be president. And the Republicans will probably still be the same dysfunctional and disappointing party it is today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Lack Strong Challengers for Some Vulnerable G.O.P. House Seats", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocratic congressional challengers have posted very impressive fund-raising tallies so far this year. In the last quarter, nearly three dozen Republican incumbents were outraised by at least one Democratic challenger \u2014 an astonishing number against sitting members of Congress. The breadth of Democratic fund-raising is also strong.But there\u2019s an important pattern under the big numbers that will shape the battleground in the 2018 midterm elections. So far, nearly all of the biggest Democratic recruiting struggles have been in working-class areas. And Democrats might have too many challengers successfully fund-raising in the most affluent districts.Democrats have debated extensively about whether they ought to focus on winning back working-class Trump voters or on expanding their gains in diverse, well-educated Sun Belt suburbs. This can be a false choice: They can do both to some extent, especially in congressional elections where individual candidates can run campaigns well suited to their districts. But Democrats, who need a net gain of 24 seats to retake the House, won\u2019t have the option to target districts they held as recently as a decade ago if they can\u2019t find viable challengers.There is not yet a strong Democratic challenger in David Valadao\u2019s district (the 21st) in California\u2019s Central Valley, the nation\u2019s least-educated Republican-held congressional district (going by the percentage of those with a college degree). It broke for Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points last November. There isn\u2019t a strong challenger in John Katko\u2019s upstate New York district (the 24th), where Barack Obama won easily in 2012 and where Mrs. Clinton won in 2016. These races remain rated as \u201clikely Republican\u201d by the Cook Political Report.Democrats have notably failed to recruit a strong challenger against the Republican freshman Brian Fitzpatrick, who represents the blue-collar suburbs northeast of Philadelphia. Frank LoBiondo, a moderate 71-year-old, 12-term congressman from an Obama district in southern New Jersey, is the sort of candidate whom the Democrats might reasonably hope to pressure into retirement with a strong challenge. But he won\u2019t be feeling much pressure so long as his top opponent has a mere $9,486 in the bank.Over all, there are 11 districts (out of the 50 districts that ought to be most competitive, by our estimates) where the Democrats don\u2019t have a candidate who raised $100,000. On average, those 11 districts are much less educated than the battlegrounds as a whole; just 31 percent of whites over age 25 have a degree. In comparison, whites with a degree represent 41 percent of the population in the other 39 districts that ought to be most competitive.The Democrats will clearly have the money to compete in expensive markets like Los Angeles and New York. They\u2019ve posted staggering fund-raising totals in many of the best-educated districts, often outpacing longtime Republican congressmen. If anything, Democrats might have the opposite problem in these well-educated areas: too many viable candidates.In Orange County, Calif., Democratic challengers have outraised Republican incumbents by a two-to-one margin this year, even though the Republicans got a head start before their Democratic challengers entered the race. But there\u2019s a catch: There are 15 Democratic candidates who have raised more than $100,000 in just those four districts, setting up a series of costly primaries that might ultimately prove detrimental to the party\u2019s general election chances. There\u2019s a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the country.The abundance of Democratic challengers in these well-educated districts is a reflection of huge enthusiasm. In these areas, there\u2019s no shortage of well-to-do and well-connected political novices looking to \u201cdo something\u201d about Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, just as there was no shortage of well-educated Democrats lining up for the Jan. 21 Women\u2019s March or donating to the campaign of Jon Ossoff in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District special election.Few established politicians are standing in the way of these political newcomers. The Democratic bench is quite weak in these traditionally Republican and often heavily gerrymandered areas. There are no obvious contenders strong enough to clear the field.An earlier version of this article misstated the competitiveness of a Democratic House challenger against Representative Jason Lewis in Minnesota. Angie Craig has a track record of successful fund-raising and will challenge Mr. Lewis in the 2018 midterms; Democrats did not fail to recruit a strong challenger in that race.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "She\u2019s a Conservative Who Loves Cher. Could She Be New York\u2019s Next Mayor?", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the RunningDuring nearly seven years as a Republican in the New York State Assembly, Nicole Malliotakis earned a reputation for embracing unpopular stances in the Democrat-controlled chamber, opposing minimum wage increases, paid family leave, gay marriage and public financing of elections.\u201cWhy would you protect individuals who are here illegally committing these crimes,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said then, \u201cinstead of putting your citizenry first and foremost?\u201dMs. Malliotakis, who is from Staten Island, is now running as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, seeking to unseat Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat.And her conservative record is not likely to pull Democratic voters to her side. She has sued the city over a program that provides identification cards to residents, trying to block officials from destroying records that might be used to identify people for deportation.These days, in campaign visits \u2014 to Korean senior centers in Queens, a church in Harlem \u2014 Ms. Malliotakis, 36, regularly invokes her family story, but for a different purpose: She knows that it is one of the best ways she can connect with voters in a liberal-minded city where nearly 40 percent of residents are foreign-born.Her appeal as a child of immigrants may be compromised by her conservative voting record and positions on issues that directly affect many of those same people.\u201cI, too, am the daughter of immigrants,\u201d said Linda Rosenthal, a Democratic assemblywoman from Manhattan, whose parents fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s. \u201cBut when someone says that, at least in the New York City context, your next thought is they relate to other children of immigrants in supporting their attempt to stay in this country, not the other side. So it\u2019s almost like trying to have it both ways.\u201dYet the immigrant story is root and branch of Ms. Malliotakis\u2019 political career. Her mother fled Cuba in 1959, shortly after the triumph of Fidel Castro\u2019s Revolution and she instilled in her daughter a fiery hatred of communism, matched by a veneration of American democracy.And it was her mother, spurred by her passion for her adopted country, who gave Ms. Malliotakis her first push into politics.Ms. Malliotakis was born on Nov. 11, 1980, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, a week after Ronald Reagan was elected president. The family lived in an apartment on East 56th Street until she was about 2, when her parents bought a two-story house on Staten Island, in Great Kills. Her father worked a variety of jobs; he was a headwaiter at the Chateau Madrid nightclub in Manhattan and operated a string of hot dog carts during the day.For a while, her parents owned a restaurant called Gyro Snack on East 54th Street. Later, they operated a business importing bibelots from Italy: Capodimonte figurines and Murano crystal. As a teen, during summer vacations, Ms. Malliotakis helped out at the warehouse in Brooklyn.Her mother, Vera, would often talk about life in Cuba. As a girl, she met Fidel Castro in his guerrilla years, when he came down from the mountains to her town, Contramaestre, to visit friends, bringing along a chicken to cook. He was charming, she said. But things changed when he came to power. The two gas stations that her father owned were seized by the government. Her father stayed, thinking Castro couldn\u2019t last, but Vera and other relatives left the country.\u201cI understand where my mother came from, not being able to elect your leaders,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said.It was her mother, too, who inadvertently set her political career in motion.\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d Vera Malliotakis, 73, joked, speaking in Spanish in an interview in a Staten Island diner. \u201cWhen Nicole was small, she was shy. I wondered what I could do with her. She didn\u2019t like music, she didn\u2019t sing or dance.\u201dHer child\u2019s pediatrician suggested that Nicole try acting or sports. Mrs. Malliotakis had a different idea.\u201cI put her in politics,\u201d she said. \u201cI picked it because I wanted her to talk to people.\u201dNicole Malliotakis volunteered to work on the campaign of a candidate for Congress. \u201cShe stuffed envelopes, talked to people on the phone, handed out palm cards,\u201d Vera Malliotakis said.The candidate, Vito J. Fossella, won, and Ms. Malliotakis caught the political bug.Soon enough, she won a campaign of her own: She was elected senior class president at New Dorp High School on Staten Island, and her friends sensed more was in her future. \u201cMost of us would write in her yearbook something like, \u2018Dear Senator,\u2019 or \u2018first female president,\u2019\u201d said Salvatore Chieffo, a high school friend.But it was her own inscription, beside her Class of 1998 portrait, that could serve as a guidepost for her bid to unseat Mayor de Blasio in the Nov. 7 election.\u201cBe courageous and bold,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen you look back on your life, you\u2019ll regret the things you didn\u2019t do more than the ones you did.\u201dBy her senior year, Nicole Malliotakis had clearly overcome her shyness: In the yearbook of the New Dorp Class of 1998, Nicole was named \u201cclass citizen,\u201d \u201cclass chatterbox\u201d and \u201cclass flirt.\u201dMs. Malliotakis attended Seton Hall University in New Jersey, and graduated in three years \u2014 finishing the last year at home, while working part time at a Gap store in the Staten Island mall. After college, she worked in the community affairs office of Gov. George E. Pataki, and then in the public relations office of Con Edison. While at Con Ed, she took night classes at Wagner College on Staten Island and earned a master\u2019s degree in business administration.In 2010, she made her first run for public office a successful one, beating a Democratic incumbent to represent an Assembly district that includes the East Shore of Staten Island and a small area of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.The bar is typically low for legislators in the minority party in Albany, but Ms. Malliotakis quickly caught the attention her new colleagues.\u201cWhen she votes \u2018No\u2019 on bills, she gets up and defends her votes on the floor,\u201d said Ms. Rosenthal, her colleague in the Assembly. \u201cI\u2019d say that only a handful of the Republican conference members speak out, and she makes a point of getting up and voicing her opinion.\u201dThat same flash of ambition and willingness to elbow her way to the front of the line was on display this spring when Ms. Malliotakis crashed the coronation that the wealthy real estate sales executive Paul J. Massey was trying to orchestrate for himself, as he sought to emerge as the Republican candidate to challenge Mr. de Blasio.Mr. Massey, a political neophyte who saw himself in the business-to-ballot mold of the former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, had pledged to spend millions of dollars of his own money to get elected \u2014 but after months of campaigning, his candidacy had not caught fire.About a month after the radio program, Ms. Malliotakis announced her candidacy.Ms. Malliotakis was suddenly the last Republican standing.\u201cI did it and I jumped in and here I am,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said.If she were to win, Ms. Malliotakis would be the first female mayor of New York City and the youngest mayor in a century.And even though the lopsided contest has stirred tepid voter interest, Democrats appear energized through their opposition to President Trump, who lost decisively in the city last November (although he won in Ms. Malliotakis\u2019 borough of Staten Island).Mr. Trump has been a millstone for Ms. Malliotakis. She initially supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But she voted for Mr. Trump in November.\u201cI voted for him because I felt that Washington needed to be shaken up,\u201d she said. But she is weary of defending her vote. \u201cThis whole campaign is all these questions about Donald Trump instead of all these issues that we should be focusing on as mayor.\u201dShe takes pains to explain how some of her Assembly votes stem from core conservative convictions: financial aid to undocumented immigrants would take aid away from citizens and those who are here legally, she said; terrorists, she warns, could use city ID cards, and destroying documentation might hamper investigators.\u201cI\u2019m very sensitive and compassionate toward immigrants,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said. \u201cBut this mayor\u2019s policies protect people convicted of crimes.\u201dYet Ms. Malliotakis has struggled to establish a clear identity or set of proposals that could justify her candidacy to most voters in the city.That difficulty was evident this month when she spoke at a breakfast for the Association for a Better New York, a prestigious civic group. The stop is de rigueur for a major party mayoral candidate, and many politicians use it to announce bold new initiatives.In 2012, Mr. de Blasio used a speech before the association to call for a major expansion of prekindergarten classes that would be paid for by a tax on high-earners \u2014 a proposal that ultimately became the centerpiece of his successful campaign for mayor.But Ms. Malliotakis brought little that was new or bold. In a 23-minute speech, she seemed to be checking off the boxes, running quickly through different policy areas, like education, public transit and policing, airing stock criticisms of Mr. de Blasio and repeatedly invoking Mr. Bloomberg, as if to suggest that a Malliotakis administration would look a lot like what came before.The event was held in a small banquet room of the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown, and the usual swarm of corporate executives, real estate developers and political heavyweights was absent. After Ms. Malliotakis finished speaking, she stood near the center of the hall, but only a few people approached to briefly exchange words and extend a hand.Regardless of the outcome, Ms. Malliotakis\u2019 mayoral candidacy has already paid dividends: It has introduced her to Republican donors, increased her name recognition, and boosted her profile. Should she lose the mayor\u2019s race, she might eventually run for Congress, City Council or borough president of Staten Island, where she owns a co-op apartment just north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.Ms. Malliotakis also frequently stays at her childhood home, sleeping in her old room, which is adorned with a signed poster of Cher. She has seen Cher in concert 28 times, beginning when she was a teenager.Assemblyman Matthew Titone, a Staten Island Democrat who is a colleague and friend of Ms. Malliotakis\u2019, said that their love of Cher was one thing they had in common, although he said he teased Ms. Malliotakis about Cher\u2019s well-known liberal advocacy.\u201cShe\u2019s kind of crushed,\u201d Mr. Titone noted, \u201cthat her politics and Cher\u2019s politics don\u2019t mesh.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It has been accused of processing financial transactions through a branch in New York for groups linked to terrorism. The plaintiffs in the case seek to hold the bank liable for attacks by Hamas and other groups in Israel and in the Palestinian territories.Jeffrey L. Fisher, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients had made grave accusations against the bank.\u201cWhat we allege is knowing and purposeful financing of terrorism with the expectation that it will make those terrorism attacks more successful and more lucrative for the perpetrators, and that is a violation of the law of nations,\u201d he said.Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the bank, said American courts have no business sorting out the truth of accusations involving foreign parties and conduct.\u201cThis case arises out of a suit by Israeli nationals against a corporation chartered in Jordan for injuries suffered in Israel and the adjoining territories,\u201d he said.Against the background, he said, the court should impose a categorical prohibition on human rights suits against corporations.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a norm to hold corporations liable for violations of international law,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially under jurisdictional circumstances like this where the United States is a stranger to the dispute.\u201dThe case, Jesner v. Arab Bank, No. 16-499, seemed to divide the justices along ideological lines; the more conservative justices appeared ready to say that corporations may never be sued under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law that allows federal district courts to hear \u201cany civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\u201dChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they feared that hearing cases against corporations under the 1789 law would cause friction in foreign relations.Mr. Fisher said that closing the courthouse door to such suits could also cause tension.\u201cImagine Israel\u2019s view if our entire finance system could be used and accessed to commit terrorist attacks, make them easier, make them more deadly, make the funding more effective,\u201d he said. \u201cIf suits like this were taken away, Israel and countries like it might well have a complaint to the United States.\u201dChief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, said that even minimal contact with the United States would not be sufficient to overcome the presumption.\u201cEven where the claims touch and concern the territory of the United States,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey must do so with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.\u201dThat decision led to the dismissal of many lawsuits, Mr. Fisher told the justices. In 2013, he said, there were 40 lawsuits pending against corporations under the 1789 law. \u201cIn the two years after Kiobel,\u201d he said, \u201cover 70 percent of those cases were dismissed on extraterritoriality grounds, and another 10 percent were dismissed for other reasons.\u201dOn Wednesday, the more liberal justices said courts had many ways to police abusive lawsuits without giving corporations a free pass. Justice Elena Kagan, for instance, told a lawyer for the bank that \u201cyou have plenty of things to gripe about in this lawsuit.\u201d But she added that corporate liability was not one of them.Brian H. Fletcher, a lawyer for the Justice Department, basically endorsed that analysis. \u201cWe have serious questions about whether or not this case belongs in U.S. court precisely because it is extraterritorial, potentially,\u201d he said. But he urged the justices not to adopt a categorical rule that corporations may never be sued under the 1789 law.The federal appeals courts are divided over whether corporations may be sued under the law. In 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to resolve the question in the Kiobel case. But it ended up ducking the issue, ruling instead that federal courts should be wary of suits that barely concern the United States.Advertisement"}

Simbana, who went on his own daddymoon in Las Vegas last year, before the birth of his son.\u201cObviously baby showers are something that are in place and have been done for a while,\u201d Mr. Simbana, 41, said. \u201cI was looking for a way to celebrate with my friends, this transition in my life.\u201dMr. Simbana\u2019s trip consisted of five fellows playing poker. Mr. Gupta, who had three bachelor parties before his 2009 wedding, one-upped him. At Marquee, the D.J. put \u201cAbha\u2019s Babymoon\u201d on the big screen behind his booth. Someone brought along a baby doll for the occasion, and the crew carried it with them everywhere, snapping photos of the onesie-clad toy on top of a bottle of Grey Goose Vodka.\u201cIt was partly inspired by \u2018The Hangover,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gupta said.\u201cIt was way more low-key and relaxed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t that feeling of pressure to make it something bigger, the way there is on a bachelor party.\u201dThe men stayed downtown rather than at a glitzy property on the Strip, played in poker tournaments and \u201cstayed up drinking and gambling until the wee hours of the night,\u201d Mr. Conroy said. \u201cBut that was it.\u201d His wife, Jennifer Betts, 40, the president of Innovative Public Relations, was, by his estimation, \u201cpretty cool about it.\u201dNot to be outdone by Mr. Gupta\u2019s daddymoon, his wife, Shaily Kapur Gupta, decided to rent a house in Napa Valley, Calif., where she hosted a dozen friends and indulged in food (a lot) and wine (minimally).But \u201cit wasn\u2019t the wild and crazy version Abhas had,\u201d said Ms. Kapur Gupta, 35, who works in advertising. \u201cI was eight months pregnant and couldn\u2019t do much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Valuable Is a Unicorn? Maybe Not as Much as It Claims to Be", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookUber is said to be worth $62.5 billion. Airbnb is valued at $31 billion. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX Technologies is valued at $21 billion, and Pinterest at $12.3 billion.Those eye-popping valuations regularly fill articles and water-cooler conversations in Silicon Valley, all under the umbrella of \u201cunicorn\u201d companies \u2014 a term for private companies that are said to be worth more than $1 billion. That moniker now applies to at least 135 businesses, making the descriptions of them as unicorns, well, less apt. (Maybe donkeys?) Early investors and employees spend countless hours calculating and recalculating how much their stake is worth.Here is some bad news for them: Those valuations may be a bit of myth \u2014 or perhaps wishful thinking.In Palo Alto, Calif., just down the road from many of the biggest tech companies and the most influential venture capitalists, a professor at Stanford University has quietly been working on a project to crunch the valuation numbers behind some of these private companies.Ilya A. Strebulaev and another professor working with him, Will Gornall of the University of British Columbia, have come to a startling conclusion: The average unicorn is worth half the headline price tag that is put out after each new valuation.And if the special side deals that most unicorn companies offer to certain investors \u2014 more on this sleight of hand in a moment \u2014 are taken into account, almost half of the companies would fall below the $1 billion threshold.That black box increasingly has relevance not just to gossips in Silicon Valley, but also to public investors. Big mutual fund companies like T. Rowe Price and BlackRock have aggressively begun investing in unicorn companies in recent years on behalf of public investors \u2014 yes, you may own a stake in Uber and not even know it \u2014 helping to increase the valuations even further.And even the big public mutual funds, the researchers contend, are not properly valuing the assets. \u201cIt is inappropriate to equate post-money valuations and fair values,\u201d the professors said, explaining how, more often than not, public funds use the headline price that comes after a round of financing, and don\u2019t distinguish between various types of shares.One of the many ways that some companies inflate their valuations, for instance, is by offering certain investors guaranteed valuations in an initial public offering. In other words, if a company doesn\u2019t reach a certain valuation at the time of an I.P.O., it will issue the investor more shares to make up the difference between the guaranteed price and the one that was attained. Effectively, all the other common shareholders end up paying the difference \u2014 and often don\u2019t know it.\u201cShares issued to investors differ substantially not just between companies but between the different financing rounds of a single company, with different share classes generally having different cash flow and control rights,\u201d the researchers said.Mr. Strebulaev said he was shocked when he dug into the contracts of the different fund-raising rounds. \u201cThe overvaluation is so large because many of these companies use sophisticated contracts that benefit some investors at the expense of other investors,\u201d he said. Without identifying a particular company, he said some of the deals were \u201cmind boggling.\u201dWorst of all, he said, he believes that \u201cthe people who are hurt the most are employees.\u201d He said that in many cases employees didn\u2019t understand that the value of the options they had been granted were disconnected from whatever the latest headline valuation of their employer might be.When Mr. Strebulaev first circulated a draft of his paper, he said, \u201ca number of companies contacted me, or, rather, their general counsels contacted me.\u201d He encouraged them to point out mistakes or factual errors. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard back from them,\u201d he said.To cite one example from the research: In 2015, Appdynamics issued a Series F round with special terms for certain investors, including \u201ca provision offering a 20% bonus in down I.P.O.s,\u201d meaning one that fell in price. Legg Mason, already an investor, then revalued its shares in the company at a higher price, \u201cdespite not being eligible for the 20% bonus,\u201d the professors wrote. \u201cThese examples are representative of common industry practices.\u201dIn another example, the professors found that sometimes a fund-raising round painted an overly \u201crosy picture.\u201d As an example, the professors used a particular fund-raising round from nearly a decade ago for SpaceX, arguing that \u201cSpaceX\u2019s value actually fell in 2008\u201d while its reported valuation went up. The researchers said investors that year \u201cwere promised twice their money back in the event of a sale, with that claim senior to all other shareholders.\u201d\u201cThat guarantee increased the price those investors were willing to pay for SpaceX shares,\u201d the professors said, \u201cbut did not alter its true value.\u201dStill, the professors were quick to say they did not believe that these terms were meant to manipulate investors.And therein lies the rub: It is not clear that the intent of these \u201cheadline\u201d valuations is to trick anyone. But they may very well be doing just that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Grand Plan to Move Beyond Oil: Big Goals, Bigger Hurdles", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Saudi Arabia is throwing an economic coming-out party of sorts this week, hawking its efforts to liberalize its conservative society and diversify its economy in a sweeping overhaul of the way the wealthy Arab kingdom has long operated.In a glittering conference center in Riyadh, slick videos promised a gleaming, $500 billion city of the future, powered by solar energy and run by robots. The crown prince lauded a \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d that embraces the world. And members of the global business elite attended standing-room-only sessions on sustainable energy and the future of urbanization.The message to bankers, businesspeople and high-rolling investors was clear: The once-insular kingdom is now open for business.\u201cToday we have a people who are convinced that by working very strongly together, Saudi Arabia and all of its projects and programs can reach new horizons in the world,\u201d Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said at the conference on Tuesday.But despite the royal rollout, including a lavish dinner with sushi, lamb and overflowing trays of chocolate truffles, the prince\u2019s grand plans have proceeded haltingly.It remains unclear to what extent top-down decrees and dramatic announcements will spur meaningful change in a society long characterized by deep religious conservatism and heavy dependence on the state.Still, many people are taking the new push more seriously than previous efforts. More than 3,500 private-equity investors, corporate chief executives, heads of global organizations and government officials from dozens of countries flocked to this week\u2019s conference, making Riyadh a who\u2019s who of international business leaders studying the kingdom\u2019s moneymaking prospects.Historically, the country\u2019s vast oil reserves, estimated at one-fifth of the world\u2019s total, made the Saudi government the primary engine of the economy. The state employed most working Saudis and financed elaborate projects, meaning that even the private sector depended heavily on government spending.To address these challenges, Prince Mohammed has proposed a range of changes under the banner of Saudi Vision 2030 that would once have been unthinkable: increasing the number of Saudis in private employment, including women; soliciting foreign investment; and selling shares of Saudi Aramco, the state oil monopoly, to raise capital to invest elsewhere.The breadth of the proposals has created a rare sense of dynamism among Saudi watchers.\u201cThe crown prince is a change agent on a very big scale, and this conference is a very big signal about how rapid is the pace of change, and that it is really happening,\u201d Daniel Yergin, a prominent energy strategist who attended the conference, wrote in an email. \u201cThis is driven by the recognition that an economic model based largely on oil, which worked for four decades, is no longer sufficient when 70 percent of the population is 30 years or younger, oil prices are volatile and the world is going digital.\u201dBut the obstacles to economic change are many, starting with a culture that often discourages risk-taking and innovation.With the government cutting costs, Saudis who could once count on secure state jobs must now compete for more demanding ones in the private sector. Moves to undo generous subsidies or reduce the number of foreign workers could destroy businesses reliant on such perks.Increased transparency could deprive members of the royal family their control over lucrative pieces of the economy. And even middle-class Saudis have grown used to subsidized energy, making them vulnerable to changes to the system.An increase in water prices was quickly reversed after similar complaints, although higher fuel prices and some so-called sin taxes on sugary drinks and other items appear to have stuck.Despite reports to the contrary, the government insists that it will hold the initial public offering for stock in Aramco next year, although much about the move remains unclear.\u201cPrince Mohammed has shown he can make bold moves on the social front,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy. \u201cHe needs now to move that focus away from the social aspects to the vested economic interests, which otherwise could hold back or possibly reverse some of the hoped-for changes.\u201dFor Saudi Arabia to thrive in an era of cheap oil, more Saudis will need to work for private companies, and Prince Mohammed has spoken about moving young Saudis into new industries and helping them become entrepreneurs.\u201cYou have a very fantastic, motivated group of young people that are now backed by their government,\u201d he said. Flat6Labs has worked with 45 start-ups in Jidda during the past three years, he said, and hopes to provide advice and capital to many more soon.But the number of Saudis in such jobs remains small. Most working Saudis are employed by the government, and private companies rely heavily on foreign workers. Foreigners make up about a third of Saudi Arabia\u2019s population of 31 million, and most are laborers who do jobs many Saudis would avoid for wages they would not accept.The Saudi government has tried to push more citizens into private-sector jobs. But true labor reform will come only through measures like reducing the number of visas for foreign workers or forcing employers to pay salaries Saudis will accept, said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Seznec, a senior fellow at the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council.\u201cThe private sector will want to make the profits, but will they accept to work with Saudis and not just hire a bunch of foreigners for one-fifth the price?\u201d he said. \u201cI am not sure that is going to happen just yet.\u201dThe primary engine of the proposed economic transformation, and the sponsor of this week\u2019s conference, is the Public Investment Fund, which invests in both Saudi and foreign entities and has recently announced a series of multimillion- and billion-dollar initiatives.These include investments in energy efficiency, dairy, entertainment and waste management companies; a fund to support small and medium-size businesses; and other investments in infrastructure, technology and the ride-hailing company Uber.The pledging of so much money has piqued the interest of international investors in Riyadh this week.\u201cThis country can pull off whatever it wants to pull off,\u201d Mary Callahan Erdoes, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset and wealth management division, said on Monday evening, before the investment conference began in earnest, over a latte in the sprawling lobby of the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton.She pointed out Barry Sternlicht, a hotel and real-estate investor who was walking by. Minutes later, Harvey Schwartz, the president of Goldman Sachs, and Arif Naqvi, founder of the Abraaj Group, an investor in emerging markets, came by her table to say hello.How much that curiosity will turn into deals remains an open question, and many investors appear to be in wait-and-see mode.\u201cThere\u2019s a significant amount of skepticism in the market around Saudi\u2019s ability to execute on Vision 2030,\u201d said Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research for Goldman Sachs. \u201cMy view is more optimistic.\u201dHis own firm is expanding rapidly in Riyadh. Its local office has doubled in size in the past year, and Goldman is reportedly advising on a number of merger deals involving Saudi companies. JPMorgan, which opened an office in Riyadh in 2006, employs 78 people and has won a significant role in the planned Aramco offering.Although it is not yet clear whether Goldman will have a role in the Aramco deal, the firm\u2019s asset-management business has a footprint in Saudi Arabia, it worked on the kingdom\u2019s international bond offering last year, and its president, Mr. Schwartz, flew in for the investment conference, speaking on a panel and holding more than a dozen meetings with clients and officials.The kingdom\u2019s reform push remains tightly linked to Prince Mohammed, who is seen by many as the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, with the blessing of his elderly father, King Salman.After failing to appear as planned to open the conference on Tuesday morning, he unveiled an ambitious plan in the afternoon to create a new city from scratch on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Red Sea coast that would rely on renewable energy and be staffed largely by robots.\u201cIt\u2019s head-spinning in its ambition,\u201d wrote Mr. Yergin, the energy strategist. \u201cThis is taking on a very big challenge that will be measured not in decades, but over a generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Did a Tiny Swiss Company Quietly Secure Valuable World Cup TV Rights?", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Investigations over the last few years by United States and Swiss law enforcement officials into corruption in global soccer have exposed dozens of people and companies that, according to prosecutors, conspired to illegally reap profits from broadcasting and sponsorship deals tied to the sport\u2019s biggest events.One company never named in any of the charging documents, but referred to obliquely, is a little-known entity based in the canton of Zug in Switzerland: Mountrigi Management Group, a three-person operation that illustrates how some of the biggest deals at the top of the world\u2019s most-popular sport were put together.Mountrigi \u2014 which borrows its name from Switzerland\u2019s Mount Rigi, also known as the Queen of the Mountains and as the muse for a series of paintings by the famed British watercolorist J. M. W. Turner \u2014 quietly amassed exclusive broadcast rights to the World Cup in much of the Americas, from Mexico down to Argentina, through 2030.Ordinarily, such rights deals are announced publicly after a formal bid process, but not on this occasion. Details of the unusual arrangement first appeared in a plea agreement involving a company charged in the United States\u2019 sprawling soccer investigation, and emerged again when the Swiss authorities this month accused FIFA\u2019s former top administrator of accepting bribes in return for lucrative TV contracts.\u201cI\u2019ve been following the sector for 18 years and had never heard of it,\u201d Frank Dunne, the editor of the respected industry newsletter TV Sports Markets, said about Mountrigi Management Group.In much of the Americas, soccer is followed with religious-like devotion, making Mountrigi\u2019s 16-nation contract extremely lucrative. Yet until the global corruption inquiries, many people working in the industry had little knowledge of the tiny company that appears to have struck gold with FIFA. United States law enforcement officials helped reveal that Mountrigi is a wholly owned subsidiary of a giant Mexican television network, Grupo Televisa.Most of FIFA\u2019s top management was removed in the aftermath of the corruption scandal, the biggest crisis since FIFA\u2019s creation 113 years ago. Current officials of the organization, which is based in Zurich, have declined to make public the details of the arrangement with Mountrigi.Mountrigi and Televisa both declined to comment.Mountrigi was supported in its dealings with FIFA by Alejandro Burzaco, an Argentine businessman, according to several people with knowledge of the negotiations who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Burzaco last year pleaded guilty to bribing soccer officials so that the company he ran would be awarded rights to the biggest regional tournaments. The company, Torneos y Competencias, entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States Department of Justice, and agreed to pay $112.8 million to settle the case.In court papers related to Torneos\u2019s agreement, prosecutors said an affiliate of a major broadcasting company headquartered in Latin America had helped to pay millions in bribes to get the rights in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay for the next four World Cups. Mountrigi, the Televisa affiliate, was awarded those rights and immediately sold them to Burzaco.Burzaco had over the years funneled millions of dollars in bribes to Julio Grondona, who was responsible for FIFA\u2019s finance committee and was one of its most powerful leaders until his death in 2014.Televisa said last year that neither its employees nor those of Mountrigi had ever \u201cpaid any bribes nor any kickback to FIFA officials related to the acquisition of rights.\u201dMountrigi\u2019s rights, and those it sold to Torneos, are the only ones that match those described in the Swiss complaint. Niclas Ericson, the FIFA executive responsible for its television division at the time, did not respond to a request for comment.Burzaco\u2019s lawyer, Sean Casey, declined to comment when asked if his client was the unnamed businessman accused in Switzerland. The Swiss attorney general\u2019s office said it could not comment.The United States has charged more than 40 individuals and businesses with a range of corruption-related crimes, and it has also brought to light details of sports rights deals that had traditionally been secured behind the scenes with little outside scrutiny.Since a powerful group of Brazilian and Argentine businessmen was exposed, some of the world\u2019s largest sports rights companies, including WME-IMG and Lagard\u00e8re Sports and Entertainment, have been able to enter a market that had been closed to them for decades.Beyond the rights it sold to Torneos as part of the agreement with Burzaco, Mountrigi has not signed deals in any of the other territories it has for the 2026 and 2030 events. That means the company can reap greater than planned profits from the expanded World Cup and a possible United States-led tournament in 2026. For FIFA, which is reliant on the quadrennial World Cup for more than 90 percent of its income of more than $5 billion, the deal might bring regret.\u201cThey\u2019ve expanded the World Cup and have got no chance of tapping into incremental value in all of the areas where that value is likely to have a large increase,\u201d Dunne said.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized legal action taken by a company whose former chief executive bribed soccer officials. The company, Torneos y Competencias, entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States Department of Justice and paid a settlement; it did not plead guilty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Unveils New Management to Quell Leadership Crisis", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Samsung Electronics, the South Korean tech giant, announced a new slate of executives on Tuesday in an effort to bring stability to its top ranks.The company, a global name in smartphones and microchips, has been suffering from a leadership vacuum. The crown prince of its controlling family was sent to prison this year on bribery charges. The family\u2019s patriarch has been in a coma since 2014. Three weeks ago, a senior executive responsible for one of its most successful businesses abruptly resigned.The troubles at Samsung\u2019s management have not diminished its status as an innovative \u2014 and highly profitable \u2014 powerhouse in the technology world. That point was underscored on Tuesday, when the company reported a record-high profit for the second quarter in a row.But the newly appointed executives, who have been drawn from Samsung\u2019s deep ranks of professional managers, could help ensure the company can run while the fate of the powerful family that built the Samsung empire remains under a cloud.The three executives appointed on Tuesday to run Samsung\u2019s major business units are Kim Kinam, who will lead its lucrative components business; H.S. Kim, its new consumer-electronics chief; and D. J. Koh, who will lead the mobile-device division. The three men are expected to serve as co-chief executives once they are elevated to the company\u2019s board, a decision that requires shareholder approval.Kim Kinam succeeds Kwon Oh-hyun, who was widely credited with building up the components business \u2014 a major revenue driver for Samsung as other smartphone makers bought up its chips and displays.But in mid-October, Samsung said Mr. Kwon planned to retire. Explaining his decision, Mr. Kwon said the company was \u201cconfronted with unprecedented crisis\u201d and needed new leadership.Samsung also said on Tuesday that its chief financial officer, S.H. Lee, would become chairman of the board starting in March. Mr. Kwon currently holds that position, too, but Samsung said it would separate the two roles for the first time. Mr. Lee, who is no relation to the Lees who founded Samsung, will leave his post as finance chief.Lee Kun-hee, the family patriarch who fell into a coma in 2014, remains chairman of Samsung Electronics, a different position from chairman of the board.C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura, said the leadership reshuffle was supposed to have taken place last year but was delayed when the heir to the Samsung conglomerate, Lee Jae-yong, was implicated in a political scandal.No company sells more smartphones than Samsung. But Samsung also makes many of the chips and display panels that go into its rivals\u2019 devices. And its chips power the data centers and servers that are in high demand thanks to the rapid expansion of cloud computing and services powered by artificial intelligence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 78 Killings, a Honduran Drug Lord Partners With the U.S.", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga led a brutal drug gang that ferried tons of cocaine north. Then he approached the Drug Enforcement Administration for a deal.Supported byTEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS \u2014 The number of murders the Honduran drug lord admitted to orchestrating over 10 years was stunning.The dead included people he described as killers, rapists and gang members. Then there were the innocents: a lawyer, two journalists, a Honduran refugee in Canada, an official who was serving as Honduras\u2019s antidrug czar and a politician who became his adviser; there were even two children caught in a shootout.In all, the drug lord, Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, said that, working in concert with drug traffickers and others, he had \u201ccaused\u201d the deaths of 78 people \u2014 a number that posed a dilemma for United States officials when Mr. Rivera came to them offering to expose high-level corruption in this Central American nation of some nine million people.But to sign Mr. Rivera to a formal cooperation agreement meant the government would most likely have to do something for him: seek leniency on his behalf, which could spare him a long prison sentence and leave the families of the Honduran victims believing that Mr. Rivera got away with murder.Today, four years after Mr. Rivera\u2019s clandestine cooperation began, federal prosecutors in Manhattan have with his help charged seven police officers from Honduras\u2019s national force, along with the son of the country\u2019s former president and several members of a prominent Honduran banking family.The evidence, a prosecutor said at a hearing on Sept. 5, showed nothing short of \u201cstate-sponsored drug trafficking.\u201dInvestigators have also gathered evidence that Honduras\u2019s former president, Porfirio Lobo, took bribes to protect traffickers, and that drug money may have helped finance the rise of the country\u2019s current president, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez.Neither politician has been charged and, through representatives, both vigorously denied the allegations to The New York Times.Prosecutors have long enlisted cooperators with violent backgrounds to achieve the greater goal of taking down a Mafia leader or some violent gang. Salvatore Gravano, the former underboss of the Gambino crime family in New York who became a government informer, admitted to killing 19 people.In the Honduras case, prosecutors who approved the agreement with Mr. Rivera and a second deal with his brother, Javier, say the men offered a rare opportunity to expose the links between drug traffickers and Honduran politicians and businessmen.\u201cThe illegal drug trade in Honduras not only infected much of its civil society, including the highest levels of government and its financial sector, but also brought frightening levels of violence on its people,\u201d Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement.Details of Devis Rivera\u2019s cooperation, which included surreptitiously recording Honduran targets, emerged in March when he testified over two days against Fabio Lobo, the former Honduran president\u2019s son. Mr. Lobo was recently sentenced to 24 years in prison for cocaine conspiracy.The Rivera brothers, who led a trafficking organization called Los Cachiros, built a fortune as middlemen, moving cocaine from hidden airstrips northward to the Mexican cartels.The brothers used violence to muscle out rivals and others, from at least 2003 when Devis Rivera was involved in the murder of a hospital security guard and, the next year, the killing of the man he had been guarding, a Honduran cartel leader.That was around the same time, Mr. Rivera testified, that he and his brother bought a president.Concerned about the possibility of extradition to the United States, Mr. Rivera said they paid more than $400,000 in bribes to President Porfirio Lobo, before and after his November 2009 election. At President Lobo\u2019s home in early 2010, Mr. Rivera received the assurance he wanted.\u201cThe president said to me to tell my brother not to worry,\u201d Mr. Rivera recalled, \u201cbecause during his four-year term nobody would get extradited.\u201dPresident Lobo also designated his son Fabio, who was once a juvenile court judge, \u201cas a middleman who would be able to protect us, help us \u2014 the Cachiros,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.Fabio Lobo became a valuable ally. \u201cI gave him a bribe almost every time I met with him,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cI knew that having him with me, everything would go well.\u201dOne time, the president\u2019s son, riding with his armed security detail in a convoy of blue Prado SUVs, escorted 1,000 kilograms of cocaine for the brothers through a police checkpoint.He \u201clowered the windows a little bit and then started talking with the police officers,\u201d Mr. Rivera recalled.By Mr. Rivera\u2019s account, the president\u2019s son threw himself into his new role, asking to visit a backcountry airstrip to \u201cfeel the adrenaline \u2014 what you experience when you receive a plane loaded with drugs.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d do anything for you,\u201d Fabio Lobo said in one recorded conversation. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the moon and back for you.\u201dBrian H. Bieber, a lawyer for former President Lobo, said his client remains under investigation by the American authorities. He said that the situation has been frustrating for Mr. Lobo, who has been \u201cloud and clear in his emphatic denial\u201d of Mr. Rivera\u2019s allegations.\u201cThere is absolutely no credible evidence to support the allegations made by an admitted mass murderer and a convicted drug trafficker,\u201d Mr. Bieber said, adding that the former president had \u201cabsolutely no\u201d relationship with the Cachiros.As President Lobo\u2019s term neared its end in 2013, Mr. Rivera had new concerns.The United States Treasury Department had announced sanctions against the Rivera brothers, and Honduran authorities began seizing their assets, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, even their zoo.\u201cI was afraid for my life. I was afraid for my family,\u201d Mr. Rivera testified. \u201cI could get killed because I had worked with politicians, police officers.\u201dBy December 2013, Mr. Rivera testified, he and his brother Javier had begun talking with the D.E.A. and prosecutors to try to strike a deal.Prosecutors wrestled with the idea of granting a deal to men who had killed so many people, particularly innocents, according to current and former government officials.Little has been said about how that deal began. On Dec. 5, 2013, Mr. Rivera and his lawyer met with the D.E.A. and at least one prosecutor at a secret session in Belize, according to one document. In all, about 20 sessions were held, the document shows.\u201cWe were trying to corroborate what they were telling us, obviously, through that process,\u201d a senior D.E.A. official said.One official said prosecutors were not aware of how many murders Mr. Rivera had been involved in \u2014 only his role in drug trafficking \u2014 until after the discussions began.Under a cooperation deal, the brothers would have to admit to \u2014 and plead guilty to \u2014 all murders and other crimes they had ever committed, even those the authorities were unaware of. That would sweep in killings that might otherwise go unaccounted for in Honduras.\u201cA guilty plea as part of cooperation is often the only way the defendant can be held accountable,\u201d Mr. Kim, the acting United States attorney, said, speaking generally.Mr. Rivera\u2019s agreement shows that if he fulfilled his end of the deal, prosecutors would seek leniency at his sentencing. He may also be placed in the witness protection program, the document says. Some of his relatives have already been permitted to move to the United States, Mr. Rivera testified.The extent of the Rivera brothers\u2019 assistance continues to become public in court proceedings. This summer, the government filed a D.E.A. search warrant application showing that in 2013, Mr. Rivera secretly recorded a conversation with another Honduran trafficker who claimed to have made a $250,000 payment intended for Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who later became Honduras\u2019s president. The document does not indicate that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez ever received the money.Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019 office responded that it was unaware, until an inquiry by The Times, of this allegation in the D.E.A. document. It attributed the claim to drug traffickers who have been targeted by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s own government\u2019s anti-narcotics campaign.\u201cIt is logical and even predictable that criminals who have been damaged by the actions of our government feel hatred and resentment against those who have made those decisions,\u201d Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s office wrote in a statement.The president\u2019s office said that the administration\u2019s fight against drug traffickers has resulted in 14 extraditions and the destruction of 150 clandestine landing strips.Still, a recent State Department report observed that in Honduras, \u201cnew criminal bosses have emerged to assume leadership of dismantled networks to continue cocaine smuggling and other forms of crime.\u201dMr. Rivera has indicated he has lived up to his end of the bargain.\u201cWhat I did was confess all the crimes that I have committed,\u201d he testified. \u201cThe work I have done with them has been to give them information, all the information I knew, about my work with drug trafficking and politicians.\u201dIn Honduras, there is relief Mr. Rivera is facing justice in New York.\u201cThey should be judged here, but by whom?\u201d said Hilda Caldera, the widow of Alfredo Landaverde, a politician and counternarcotics official who was assassinated in December 2011 \u2014 one of the murders to which Mr. Rivera has pleaded guilty. \u201cThe justice here is contaminated.\u201dIn an interview at the national university where she teaches, Ms. Caldera said her husband had been willing to declare what few others would say publicly: that traffickers had infiltrated the police and military.\u201cHe was alone, so alone, in talking about this,\u201d she said.Mr. Landaverde\u2019s name appears on a spreadsheet, titled Appendix A, that is part of Mr. Rivera\u2019s plea agreement. The three-page document lists the 78 murders through 2013 that Mr. Rivera admitted involvement in.The names of 49 victims are listed only partially or as \u201cFNU LNU\u201d \u2014 first and last names unknown \u2014 and other details where available.One was \u201can assassin believed to have worked for the Echeverria-Ramos family.\u201d Several were \u201csuspected\u201d murderers and rapists.Twenty-nine victims are named in full, including Mr. Landaverde, the 51st entry.One victim\u2019s father, Heriberto Palacios, said he long doubted that whoever ordered the killing of his son, Nahum, would be held to account, and he was uneasy at the prospect of leniency for the Rivera brothers, given \u201call of the evil they did in Honduras.\u201dHis son had been a prominent television and radio reporter, an advocate for farmers locked in a bloody struggle with large landowners. In 2010, Nahum and his girlfriend, Yorleny S\u00e1nchez, a doctor, were fatally shot near his home. They are victims Nos. 23 and 24.Mr. Palacios, a retired farm laborer, said he had once gone to a local government office to inquire about his son\u2019s murder investigation. He said officials refused to provide any information, lest he \u201cmight misinterpret it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Ready to Move on a Tax Plan Few Have Seen", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe swift pace to complete, release and quickly vote on a tax cut is aimed at leaving little time for the type of dissent that has scuttled previous tax proposals.Senators approved a budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year on Thursday night, setting up a rapid series of hearings and votes with the aim of getting a bill to President Trump by Christmas.Republicans have been meeting for weeks in closed-door sessions to debate details of the tax plan, including two half-day retreats for House members late last month. House leaders will hold two smaller-group sessions next week, scheduled to last three to four hours each.The speed is striking \u2014 and strategic \u2014 for tax legislation that lobbyists believe could span 1,000 pages. Republicans hope the breakneck pace will help hold their narrow Senate majority together against what will almost certainly be a deluge of lobbying and Democratic criticism.The last major tax overhaul, which passed in 1986, took nearly 11 months from introduction to presidential signature.\u201cSome have described Washington as the slowest town until it is the fastest town,\u201d said Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Tax Policy in the House Ways and Means Committee, \u201cand I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen here.\u201dCongressional Republicans are under intense pressure from campaign donors, business groups and the White House to deliver a major legislative victory after nine months of congressional disappointment on big issues. Party leaders say they have learned from those setbacks, including the collapse of the health care push this summer.Lawmakers \u201cshould have had a bill six months ago,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, who is advising the White House on the tax effort. \u201cThey will look so incompetent if they don\u2019t get this done,\u201d he said, adding that Republicans know the economy could suffer and that they could lose badly in the midterm elections next year if they do not pass something quickly. \u201cUltimately, that\u2019s why I\u2019m optimistic.\u201dThe bills being drafted, as described by top Republicans and lobbyists, would affect family budgets across the United States, by altering tax brackets and some popular deductions, and investment decisions around the globe, by changing the way the United States taxes multinational companies. It centers on deep cuts to business tax rates, which Republicans promise will deliver income gains to middle-class workers.Business groups are meeting frequently with key Republicans, seeking to shape the bill, but no snippets of legislative text have yet become public.However, party leaders cannot finalize a bill until another budget hurdle is cleared \u2014 the Senate and House must agree on a consensus budget document, which will include instructions for how much a tax bill could reduce federal tax revenues over the next decade. That document, which would be an agreement between the House and Senate, is crucial to allowing Republicans to change tax law without any Democratic support. Such agreement could come quickly or drag out over a week or more, depending on whether House members agree to the Senate version or demand substantial changes to it.Republican leaders hope to finalize and introduce the House version of the tax bill as soon as early November, allow amendments from both parties in committee and on the House floor, and pass something by Thanksgiving. Senate leaders hope to pass a bill by December or early next year.Democrats say that process does not allow time for careful consideration of the bill, or for the sort of bipartisan compromise that marked the 1986 effort.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that something this momentous would be done without hearings, when you consider they\u2019re about to fundamentally alter the architecture of the nation\u2019s revenue collection,\u201d said Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.Republican leaders say there has been enough discussion of tax issues to warrant a fast vote. The House Ways and Means Committee has conducted more than 40 hearings on tax issues over the past five years, and the Senate Finance Committee has held 70.\u201cThe quicker we can get this done, the quicker we can start growing the economy,\u201d said Matthew M. Miller, a vice president for the Business Roundtable who handles tax issues. \u201cThere\u2019s been thorough opportunity to have discussions on what the policy needs to be.\u201dMichael A. Steel, a managing director at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington and a longtime aide to John A. Boehner, the former House speaker, said that he expected \u201can intense, if not frenetic\u201d debate between the introduction of the bill and the votes in committee and on the floor. Businesses, he added, were preparing their arguments in the hopes of changing any provisions that could hurt them financially.He said he was optimistic that the House could finish its work by the end of November \u2014 a contrast to several fiscal fights waged in late December when Mr. Boehner was speaker and Barack Obama was president.\u201cThis is a wrinkle, having a legislative deadline threaten Thanksgiving,\u201d Mr. Steel said. \u201cWe usually screw up Christmas.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Limit on 401(k) Savings? It\u2019s About Paying for Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the benefits adviser Ted Benna first thought up a new type of employee savings plan in 1980, the client he created it for rejected the idea as too risky. After all, no one had previously used the unremarkable section of the tax code called 401(k) to defer paying taxes on money that rank-and-file workers set aside for retirement.Without intending to, Mr. Benna set off a revolution. Nearly 40 years later, 401(k) accounts are the most common employer-sponsored retirement plans and a raft on which millions of Americans hope to float through retirement.Many workers once could depend on defined-benefit pensions, but those plans \u2014 expensive for employers \u2014 have mostly gone the way of the Walkman. Instead, workers were left with the responsibility of saving for retirement themselves, with individual retirement accounts or 401(k)s. The switch has meant less security.Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the principal Republican architect of the tax plan in the House, also scrambled to reassure critics that a rewrite would not undermine retirement savings.\u201cAll the focus is on, can we help people save more,\u201d he said.Yet for all the alarming rhetoric about crushed nest eggs, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.Details of the Republican tax plan have not yet been released, but the talk has been of imposing a cap of $2,400 a year on tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) plans \u2014 a sharp reduction from the current ceiling of $18,000 a year for people under 50, and $24,000 for people age 50 and above.There would still be a tax benefit, but it would probably be under a Roth-style structure.To some people, enjoying the break when they withdraw money instead of when they deposit it may not make a difference. But for Republicans in Washington desperately seeking a fast boost in revenue, timing is everything.That\u2019s where 401(k)\u2019s come in. Rather than allow workers to continue delaying their tax payments, the Republican leadership wants to collect tax revenue on most new contributions upfront so they can use it to pay for those expensive corporate tax cuts. That\u2019s the equivalent of a middle-class tax increase.\u201cIt\u2019s just an enormous budget gimmick,\u201d said William Gale of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. \u201cIt\u2019s raiding future revenues to pay for current tax cuts. This is not a retirement security story.\u201dThe accounting sleight-of-hand irks Mr. Gale, a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush, because, he says, it is financially irresponsible. \u201cIt\u2019s just government borrowing by another name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not really raising revenue,\u201d just changing when it\u2019s collected.The question of whether deferring taxes on retirement savings is actually good policy, however, is a separate matter.Still, these retirement plans are extremely popular among middle and upper-income voters and many of the politicians who represent them \u2014 which is why previous attempts to eliminate them have failed.Mr. Gale says he thinks the immediacy of the 401(k) tax break encourages people to save more than they otherwise might. So does Mr. Benna, the 401(k)\u2019s inventor. Although he says the tax deferral alone \u2014 without employers matching some of their employees\u2019 contributions \u2014 was probably insufficient to persuade lower-wage workers to participate, it has nudged up middle-class savings. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to save the same amount after taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a drop-off in contributions.\u201dBut other experts aren\u2019t so sure.Andrew Biggs, formerly a principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said that for most people, it makes little difference whether they pay taxes on retirement savings now or in the future. Automatic enrollment and the employer matches are much more important than the delayed taxes, said Mr. Biggs, now a retirement specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.And depending on future tax law, Mr. Choi said that retirees with Roth accounts could get by with smaller contributions than those with 401(k)\u2019s because they won\u2019t have to pay as much tax on the savings they withdraw.Setting the cap there could drag down savings because people tend to interpret such thresholds as recommendations, he said. From that perspective, it would be better to eliminate tax deferrals altogether rather than set such a low ceiling.Yet whether the 401(k) caps are untouched, slashed or abandoned altogether, the prospect remains that millions of Americans will face retirement with no savings.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Trade Deficit Matters, and What Trump Can Do About It", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ScenePresident Trump surely remembers when Japan was eating America\u2019s lunch.Three decades later, some protagonists have changed, but the plot remains the same. Hobbled by a two-decade slump, Japan is out of the picture. Mr. Trump\u2019s main nemeses are now Mexico and China, and he remains fixated on getting even.And yet the president\u2019s political success, 30 years after his diatribes against Japan, underscores just how much the trade deficit matters. A symbol of America\u2019s malaise, it helped propel his insurgent candidacy to the presidency by harnessing beleaguered workers\u2019 anger at the status quo.As C. Fred Bergsten, founder and director emeritus of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told me, \u201cEven if the deficit is financeable it is not sustainable in domestic political terms.\u201dThe trade deficit\u2019s political power raises a question that seems overdue: Why has an advanced nation like the United States allowed such large imbalances to persist for such a long time? Perhaps there is a case for policy makers in Washington to do something to narrow the gap.The American current account deficit \u2014 the broadest measure of the balance of trade in goods and services \u2014 is an anomaly.Economists\u2019 standard explanation of international trade says that rich countries like the United States will export capital, of which they have a lot, lending to poorer nations that have little capital but a lot of cheap labor. These poor countries, in turn, will invest the borrowed money in American-made machines for factories in which to employ their workers. So the lending will generate exports for the United States \u2014 building a trade surplus.Most developed nations adhere to this pattern most of the time. The European Union now has a current account surplus. If it weren\u2019t for the United States, so would the G7 group of major industrialized countries. But since 1980, the United States has found itself mostly on the borrowing end of the deal. It has used the foreign capital to finance investment at home, racking up huge trade deficits along the way.Some economists will argue that the trade deficit is ultimately irrelevant if there is sufficient money coming in from abroad to pay for it at a reasonable interest rate. So what if China owns a ton of Treasury bonds? Even fears that it might dump them to hurt the United States ignore that China has little incentive to do that. It would amass enormous losses, too.But it is a mistake to ignore the wounds caused by persistent trade imbalances on American workers.The trade deficit hasn\u2019t had a uniform effect across the economy. As it soared over the last half century, it was workers in industries that compete with imports \u2014 like manufacturing \u2014 who lost out. And employment shifted to industries that were not exposed to trade.The combination, Mr. Bergsten suggests, produced the protectionist backlash that delivered the presidency to Mr. Trump.The United States has run large trade deficits when its trading partners were manipulating the currency and when they weren\u2019t. It ran large trade deficits when President Ronald Reagan ran large budget deficits. It ran them again when the Clinton administration turned the budget deficit into a surplus \u2014 a change that should have increased national savings, economists argued at the time.Economists argue that the deficits will stop when Americans stop consuming and investing more than they earn, reducing the demand for money from overseas. But that is easier said than done.The one straightforward recommendation to address the trade deficit would be for Mr. Trump to do something he surely won\u2019t: drop the rest of his promised economic agenda, starting with his multitrillion-dollar tax cut, which would reduce national savings and make the trade deficit balloon.The dollar is the main currency used in global trade, as well as international capital market transactions. People and governments the world over store their wealth in American stocks and bonds. What\u2019s more, the dollar is the go-to currency in the time of financial crises, even if the crises at hand are centered in the United States. Against these forces it is hard to keep the dollar down.All Mr. Baker had to do was convince his counterparts that if they didn\u2019t play they might risk protectionist moves from Congress. And by 1989, the dollar had fallen 50 percent against the Japanese yen and more than 40 percent against the West German mark.This kind of approach seems like a perfect fit for Mr. Trump, who tends to enjoy making threats. If he did so, the trade deficit might even close. In 1991, the United States even ran a current account surplus for two full quarters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scientists in Mexico Scramble to Deploy Seismic Sensors", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe network, focusing on a seismically active area known as the Guerrero Gap, would track seafloor deformation and so-called silent slips, he wrote, with the goal of mitigating the human risks of earthquakes and tsunamis.As this country recovers, one of Latin America\u2019s largest seismologic research projects is also feeling a jolt.\u201cWe want to have a better understanding and go faster with our research,\u201d said Josue Tago, a seismologist working to build the sensor network. \u201cThe research that we do can help save lives, and that\u2019s a different kind of motivation.\u201dAll along Mexico\u2019s west coast, the Cocos and North American tectonic plates meet, the former sliding under the latter. This so-called subduction zone yields periodic earthquakes, which release the energy building up as the plates push against each other.The Guerrero Gap, just offshore, is of particular concern to scientists because of its proximity to Mexico City \u2014 about 200 miles to the southwest. The new network, which relies on GPS, pressure and seismic data, will analyze tectonic plate movement.To do that, researchers will install sensors and take preliminary measurements in November. Then, over the next four years, a group of more than 50 scientists based in Japan and Mexico will gather data, create computational models of earthquakes and tsunamis, and generate maps of coastal areas near the gap at risk for the next big one.But the two recent quakes have also highlighted differing scientific opinion about which parts of Mexico are now the most likely to yield the next earthquake. The zone along the coast of the state of Michoacan, which produced the giant quake of 1985? Somewhere southeast of the Guerrero Gap? The gap itself?On one hand, one segment of the Guerrero Gap has not seen significant seismic activity in over a century, suggesting accumulated stress there could produce a large earthquake in the near future.Recent quakes may have triggered a tectonic tremor there, but researchers do not know if significant energy was released. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to evaluate how much those processes could accelerate the movement,\u201d Dr. Cruz said.But the gap\u2019s seismic silence is not totally convincing to all scientists. Some look at the 143-mile stretch and shrug, saying future quakes now appear even less likely to occur there, compared with other places along the coast.\u201cPeople get excited when earthquakes occur within or near a gap, but of course earthquakes occur elsewhere as well,\u201d said David Jackson, a geophysics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is not involved with the new network in Mexico.\u201cI\u2019d follow the earthquakes, rather than the gaps,\u201d he added. But \u201cI\u2019d rather have somebody instrument a gap than not instrument anything.\u201dResearchers trace the current focus on the Guerrero stretch of Mexico\u2019s subduction zone to Japan\u2019s 9.0 magnitude Tohoku quake and tsunami in 2011. It caught Japanese scientists by surprise, despite the nation\u2019s highly sophisticated seismic network.\u201cThat was an eye-opener for us,\u201d said Vala Hj\u00f6rleifsd\u00f3ttir, a geophysicist at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City. \u201cWe think that we know what earthquakes could happen here. Is that it, or is there more?\u201d she said.Mexico, she noted, has not seen a large tsunami since 1932.The Tohoku quake was preceded by a so-called slow-slip event, in which energy is released over a period of weeks or months. The Guerrero Gap has recorded some of the largest slow-slip events in the world, which intrigued Japanese seismologists.Researchers at Kyoto University formally joined with scientists at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University to study the area in 2013. The network they are starting to build will not only help detect earthquakes, but also offer data about plate tectonics and such slow-slip events.If Mexico were a wealthier country, scientists say, a detection network might be extended, with seismometers blanketing the long stretch of ocean bottom between the Middle American trench \u2014 where the edge of the Cocos plate dives beneath the North American \u2014 and the shore.But unlike other countries such as the United States, Japan, and New Zealand, which have used similar geophysical techniques to measure plate movements, Mexico is mostly dependent on the largess of others for its large-scale geophysics research.About $6 million is dedicated to the current network, with about $2 million contributed by Mexico and the rest by Japan\u2019s Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development. Instruments supplied by Japan will be left in Mexico after the project is completed.\u201dThere are so many priorities in Mexico that it\u2019s difficult that a seismology geophysics project gets financing this big,\u201d said Dr. Cruz of the new network.A general lack of funding, combined with the general guesswork inherent in seismology, means scientists in Mexico must carefully pick locations to monitor. Because of the two recent quakes, resources are stretched even more thinly.\u201cThe nature of the problem is that we\u2019re never going to be right,\u201d Dr. Hj\u00f6rleifsd\u00f3ttir said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sort of been waiting for this big earthquake in Guerrero, but it\u2019s not the only place.\u201dShe compares the country\u2019s monitoring efforts to those once focused on an area of the San Andreas fault in California, which produced earthquakes roughly every 20 years for about a century.\u201dIn order to study the earthquakes, they instrumented it very well. And then once they put the instruments there, they just waited and waited, and it didn\u2019t happen until like 35 years later,\u201d Dr. Hj\u00f6rleifsd\u00f3ttir said.Scientists can gather information about the earth\u2019s movement that can contribute to disaster preparation, Dr. Cruz said. But they cannot predict earthquakes.\u201dEven though we, nor anyone else in the world, cannot know when an earthquake will happen,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can generate knowledge that reduces the risk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The conversation was going well, Mr. James recently recalled, until the investor asked where he was based. \u201cAs soon as I told him I was from Utah, he literally, without saying a word, turned around and walked away.\u201dUtah entrepreneurs no longer get that icy response.The state has a thriving technology hub in the roughly 80-mile swath from Provo to Ogden, with Salt Lake City in between. The region has given rise to at least five companies valued at more than $1 billion. The concentration of these so-called unicorns is surpassed only by California, New York and Massachusetts, according to CB Insights, which tracks venture capital investment.Mr. James has even helped coin the name \u201cSilicon Slopes\u201d to brand the region \u2014 a wink at the Bay Area and a nod to the renowned ski areas in the state, home to the 2002 Olympics.\u201cFounders viewed their companies like they\u2019re building the family business or a farm \u2014 they\u2019re building them to keep,\u201d said Ryan Smith, the founder of Qualtrics, a data analytics company that focuses on surveys and other research for corporate and academic clients. \u201cWith no outside funding, there\u2019s no lifeline and you have to figure it out on your own.\u201dOne reason for the growth, said Mark Gorenberg, a venture capitalist with Zetta Venture Partners in San Francisco, is the emphasis that some start-ups have placed on data analytics \u2014 a growing field that has helped put the state on the map. E-commerce companies, as well as those specializing in medical devices and cloud computing, have also flourished.As the local tech community has grown, local venture capital firms have formed in the state, providing seed money as well as participating in later funding rounds. According to CB Insights, more than $2.6 billion has been invested in the 10 most well-funded companies in Utah.\u201cThe region transformed from a recreation area with some tech companies to a full tech ecosystem,\u201d said Mr. Gorenberg, whose firm has invested in three Utah-based companies.In a state where 59 percent of residents describe themselves as active Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a presence in the start-up scene as well. Many company founders are members, and while the church does not directly invest in individual companies, said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the church, the emphasis on family permeates many start-ups in the area.Some say the Mormon culture fosters a collaborative spirt among the area\u2019s tech community, and the founders of unicorns regularly get together. Last month, for example, several founders worked until 3 a.m. at Mr. Smith\u2019s home, organizing a January conference meant to coincide with the Sundance Film Festival in Utah \u2014 an effort to create a tech and entertainment conference similar to the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex.Mr. Smith\u2019s father, Scott, started Qualtrics in 2002 to help businesses measure customer and client satisfaction; the younger Mr. Smith joined the nascent company while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University after doctors diagnosed cancer in his father (who has since recovered). His older brother Jared, an executive at Google, joined several years later.The company, which has received funding from Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital and Insight Venture Partners, now has a valuation of $2.5 billion. Mr. Smith said it had annual revenue above $250 million, with corporate clients including Microsoft and Marriott International.At Pluralsight, a company focusing on tech training, the trajectory was similar. Aaron Skonnard, its chief executive, founded the company with three others, each putting in $5,000 to initially develop in-person training programs.The four traveled worldwide for their programs until Mr. Skonnard realized that it would be more efficient to train clients online; by 2011, the company had begun offering only virtual training, walking away from half of its $1.5 million in revenue. But the switch paid off. Pluralsight began receiving outside funding in 2012 from venture capital firms such as Insight Venture and Iconiq Capital. The company, now valued at more than $1 billion, estimated that revenues will reach $190 million this year.Now, the start-ups are dealing with the challenges to growth that others in tech face: recruiting new engineers and programmers, as well as seasoned executives.It is one area where the companies outwardly compete, especially as they seek to improve their diversity. And the hiring needs can be significant. Pluralsight, for example, this month announced plans to add 2,400 new jobs over the next decade and move from Farmington to a new campus south of Salt Lake City, closer to the other tech companies.The local universities have played an important role in fostering homegrown talent. Brigham Young, the private university affiliated with the Mormon Church, and the public University of Utah have programs intended to develop young entrepreneurs.But as demand for talent has grown, it has also meant companies have needed to recruit outside Utah.Their pitch often involves promoting the accessibility of outdoor activities, including hiking and skiing. Jaunts to Park City, the ski town, are common, and many choose to settle in that area. Besides, the office spaces of many of these companies typify the start-up ethos: abundant food, table tennis and pool tables, and, at Qualtrics, even an indoor basketball court.The companies also talk up the growth of their competitors, to assure recruits that many opportunities exist within the state if an employee \u2014 at any level \u2014 wants to make a move. There are more than 4,000 tech companies in the state, according to figures from the governor\u2019s office; Mr. James, who employs 810 people at Domo, sometimes suggests that those interviewing speak to others in the region.\u201cI want them to know that re-deployability isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d he said.The efforts have paid off, Mr. Smith said. This year alone, his company has hired 150 people who moved from outside the state.Joy Driscoll Durling, the chief information and digital enablement officer at Vivint Smart Home, was working at Adobe in California when she had the opportunity to move to Utah, where Adobe established offices after its acquisition of Omniture.\u201cNo one in my family could believe I was even considering it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut my family and I appreciate the outdoors.\u201dAnd while they briefly considered returning to the Bay Area, they have stayed because of both work-life balance and the career opportunities. In March, Ms. Durling left Adobe and joined Vivint, which provides home security and automation products.Apart from lifestyle, the potential for an initial public offering helps with recruiting \u2014 and legitimacy. Farrah Kim, a spokeswoman for CB Insights, said the best \u201cway to jump-start a start-up ecosystem is for a cluster of big exits to emerge,\u201d whether through deals or I.P.O.s.The public markets afford companies more capital for growth, whether organic or through acquisitions, Mr. James said. And, he added, an I.P.O. enhances a company\u2019s profile because it shows that the business has been vetted by bankers and lawyers.\u201cOne day, people think you\u2019re a cute entrepreneur,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re treated dramatically different once you\u2019re public.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wary of Hackers, States Move to Upgrade Voting Systems", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 State election officials, worried about the integrity of their voting systems, are pressing to make them more secure ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.Reacting in large part to Russian efforts to hack the presidential election last year, a growing number of states are upgrading electoral databases and voting machines, and even adding cybersecurity experts to their election teams. The efforts \u2014 from both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 amount to the largest overhaul of the nation\u2019s voting infrastructure since the contested presidential election in 2000 spelled an end to punch-card ballots and voting machines with mechanical levers.One aim is to prepare for the 2018 and 2020 elections by upgrading and securing electoral databases and voting machines that were cutting-edge before Facebook and Twitter even existed. Another is to spot and defuse attempts to depress turnout and sway election results by targeting voters with false news reports and social media posts.West Virginia\u2019s elections team has added a cybersecurity expert from the state National Guard with a top-secret federal security clearance. Colorado and Rhode Island will now verify election results via an advanced statistical procedure called a risk-limiting audit.Delaware is moving its voter-registration list off the state\u2019s aging mainframe computer and preparing to replace a 21-year-old electronic voting system that does not leave a paper record of votes to be audited.Last month, a panel of state, federal and private election experts completed a sweeping revision of guidelines for manufacturers of new voting equipment, the first major overhaul in a dozen years. While the guidelines are voluntary, they are endorsed by all but three states, so manufacturers effectively must meet the new standards to sell their equipment in most of the nation.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is a psy-ops operation,\u201d said Mac Warner, the West Virginia secretary of state. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Russians are running against us now, trying to erode confidence in our democratic process. We need to assure our citizens that we\u2019re aware of these attacks, that we have assistance to counter them, and that when they do occur, don\u2019t panic \u2014 there are resources to turn to.\u201dIn an era of bitter political divisions and elections-rules disputes, the effort to make the vote more secure is notably bipartisan and relatively rancor-free. Republicans like Mr. Warner are largely aligned with Democrats on the need to act before the next presidential election in 2020, and there is some support in both parties in Congress for helping to finance changes.\u201cIt\u2019s really important not to overstate the risk. There are lots of things that can be done to make sure machines are as secure as possible,\u201d Lawrence Norden, the deputy director of the Democracy Project at the Brennan Center for Justice of the New York University School of Law. \u201cBut when you\u2019re dealing with a nation-state, you have to assume that at some point they\u2019re going to be successful in their efforts to breach things. The question then becomes resiliency and the ability to show people that you can fix things even if there is a breach.\u201dState officials, who zealously guard their control of elections, have greeted federal efforts to address voting security with wariness. But that, too, has changed. State election directors who were blindsided and angered by the Homeland Security department\u2019s critical infrastructure designation will meet with department officials in Atlanta this month to discuss how they can share information about threats. The department also is working to give state election officials security clearances so they can view classified assessments of dangers to the election system.He said the shared guidelines would allow for the deployment of election software on products like tablets and iPads, which could be ready as soon as the 2020 election, rather than force 50 states to put together their own systems. \u201cIt\u2019s going to drive innovation, hopefully save money for election officials, and allow us to test and certify equipment more efficiently,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Masterson said.Foreign governments that regularly crack the computers of military contractors and federal agencies will not be daunted by the cyberdefenses of voter databases and electronic pollbooks. A determined adversary could compromise voting equipment at many points along the supply chain, from the factory assembler to the election software programmer to the technician who makes a repair or installs a software upgrade. And in an industry dominated by a handful of companies, malicious tinkering could have a broad impact.\u201cIn computer security, you\u2019re talking much more about the capabilities of local jurisdictions,\u201d said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technology officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. \u201cAnd they vary dramatically, from L.A., which has a small army of folks, to many jurisdictions that don\u2019t even have a full-time person for their election work. To the extent they have an ability to defend against these attacks, it\u2019s quite limited.\u201dMr. Hall said election officials need to be even more vigilant, and impose a \u201czero-trust networking\u201d policy on their agencies. \u201cDon\u2019t assume that because something is locked in a case that it\u2019s safe,\u201d he said. \u201cAssume they\u2019re already in your system, and set up things that will catch them \u2014 honey pots, fake data stores. If anyone hits them, then you know someone\u2019s poking around.\u201dBipartisan legislation in both the House and Senate would provide a modest amount of federal money for new machines. But prospects for passage are uncertain, and many states are unable or unwilling to fill the breach.The South Carolina Election Commission estimates that it could cost $40 million to replace the state\u2019s antiquated voting equipment with machines that used auditable paper ballots. So far the State Legislature has come up with $1 million, said Chris Whitmire, a spokesman for the commission.\u201cWe\u2019re using the same equipment we\u2019ve used since 2004,\u201d he said. \u201cIf $40 million dropped into our hands today, we\u2019d have a paper ballot trail, too.\u201dBut even states that cannot afford more secure machines are taking steps to harden their election systems and bolster public confidence in the vote. South Carolina has accepted an offer of free \u201ccyberhygiene\u201d scans of its system by Homeland Security experts. Colorado is upgrading its voting equipment, but it has also begun to receive Homeland Security screenings, added national guard security experts to its election team and tacked a basic security measure onto its voter-registration database: two-step authentication for anyone seeking to log into the system.State election officials are now in regular contact with federal security and intelligence agencies about threats to the vote, said Trevor Timmons, the chief information officer for Wayne W. Williams, the Colorado secretary of state.\u201cI\u2019ve spent more time talking to three-letter agencies in the last year than I have in my entire career,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prenup Is a Four-Letter Word", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveOn the corner of my lawyer\u2019s desk was a red button marked \u201cNo.\u201d It was the type you might find in a display of gag gifts, next to the Whoopee cushions and boxing nun action figures.My 18-month-old son, Jamie, was on my lap, fussing and squirming with enough force that I was struggling to remain upright. As my lawyer talked about the prenuptial agreement my fianc\u00e9\u2019s lawyer had drawn up, that \u201cNo\u201d button became my focal point, as if it were warning me not to sign.I was 42, as was my fianc\u00e9, Matt. We had been together for six years. The first two were long-distance, with him in Mountain View, Calif., and me in Portland, Ore., where I was caring for my terminally ill mother. Until, at her urging, I moved south to join Matt. A few years later, we had Jamie.I wanted to get married then, but Matt held back. Marriage scared him more than having a child together, and a big part of his fear was financial. He did eventually propose, beautifully so, but as we got further in our wedding planning, he said he wanted us to sign a prenup.I cringed but ultimately agreed, believing it was the only way forward.He said he would pay all of the lawyers\u2019 fees and make it as easy as possible. It sounded simple. The reality, however \u2014 especially having to confess every detail of my sketchy financial history to this lawyer \u2014 was nothing short of awful.On paper, I had approximately $3,500 in savings, no retirement account and a four-year-old Toyota Yaris with a Blue Book value of $8,000, on which I still owed $4,000. Humbled cannot begin to describe how I felt. More like demoralized, demolished and desperate.My lawyer asked if I had read the document carefully and understood the terms.I numbly nodded, but I was lying. I hadn\u2019t read it. I didn\u2019t understand the terms. I hated being forced to consider the implications of divorce before I was even married, no matter how much I loved and trusted Matt.The agreement was essentially California law on paper if we ever left the state, which I understood to mean that if we were to divorce, we would leave the marriage with what we had brought into it and divide the rest. That seemed fair to me. We were in our 40s, not our 20s, and he was the one with assets to lose.Money, Matt often said, was what people fought about most and what broke up relationships and marriages. True to form, we had been fighting about money since we started dating, our arguments complicated by the vastly different ways we had chosen to live our lives.After a few post-college years working in marketing, I had quit the corporate world to wait tables and write, living paycheck to paycheck ever since. As a result, when Matt and I met, I had racked up $10,000 in credit card debt and my savings account was empty.Matt had done the opposite, spending about 15 years at the same company, working in finance, no less. He had saved and saved, amassing an amount that he hadn\u2019t disclosed to anyone.However, Matt once told me that if he could have done anything with his life, he would have been a rock journalist, \u00e0 la Lester Bangs. He wasn\u2019t unhappy with his career, but his admission suggested he had traded passion for stability, whereas I had followed my passion at the expense of stability. Why should I be entitled to his money?My lawyer pulled out a yellow tablet on which he calculated the hypothetical divorce payout from a man I wasn\u2019t yet married to from the sale of a house we didn\u2019t yet own. He worried that a house-sale clause could be unfair to me.The other lawyers I\u2019d contacted had been overly familiar and aggressive simultaneously, saying, \u201cHow exciting! Well, let\u2019s hope the document just goes into a drawer for the next 20 years, right? So, what exactly are your assets?\u201dI thanked them for their time and $5,000 retainer estimates. I chose this lawyer because he had been comparatively relaxed about the process and its cost. Now, I sort of hated him. As he rattled off figures, Jamie started to cry.The lawyer looked up, winked and pushed the \u201cNo\u201d button, filling his office with mechanized cries: \u201cNo way!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so!\u201d \u201cNope!\u201dMy son laughed, and I managed a grim smile. Then the lawyer continued to point out all the ways I was going to lose should the marriage fail.I finally stopped him and said, eyes brimming, \u201cCan you just tell me what it all means?\u201dOur relationship\u2019s albatross \u2014 money \u2014 felt like it was rotting on a rope around my neck. Over the years, Matt had fixated on its importance to an annoying degree: How much was I saving for my move to California? Were my weekly happy hour outings with girlfriends really necessary? Was I ever going to find a job with benefits and a 401(k)?I felt controlled, sometimes trapped.My mother said, \u201cHe\u2019s got to let you breathe or he\u2019s going to lose you.\u201dIt became such an issue that we spent a few months in couples therapy when Jamie was an infant. Those sessions helped us understand that his money issues stemmed from family dynamics and a string of former girlfriends who had betrayed him.Understanding the situation, however, didn\u2019t change how Matt felt about it. He still wanted the prenup. Big numbers in bank accounts made him feel protected from the chaos of the world in a way they didn\u2019t for me. Just as this process felt humiliating for me in a way it didn\u2019t for him. I had told only one friend about it, a stay-at-home mother who, coincidentally, is married to a lawyer.\u201cPeople get them all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201dWhen I left the lawyer\u2019s office that day, I felt miserable and unmoored. As I walked to my Yaris with my still-fussing son balanced on one hip, I called Matt, sobbing. I told him what had happened and how surprisingly worthless it made me feel.\u201cWhat a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be simple. I forgot that nothing is simple when you get lawyers involved. Listen, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, but let\u2019s just sign it and finish the process. Let\u2019s be done.\u201dThat\u2019s what I wanted, to be done. Done feeling like a failure. Done having lawyers involved in my relationship. Done feeling too much like the wife in \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d who has to split everything down the middle with her husband, including the strawberry ice cream, which she doesn\u2019t eat and in fact despises.I called my lawyer and told him Matt and I were getting married in a week and I wanted to sign the prenup. He advised against, citing the troublesome house-sale clause.Finally, for several thousand more dollars in fees, he negotiated with Matt\u2019s lawyer to change language that Matt had never asked to be included so that when we sold the house we didn\u2019t yet own, I would get my fair share.A few days later, Matt and I sat in a conference room and made the agreement official. Jamie was with us, spinning in the boardroom chairs and giggling, moving back and forth between Matt and me. The lawyers were chatty and friendly as we signed, pressed our thumbs into an ink pad and had everything notarized.It was early, and we hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast. After leaving, we walked to a nearby diner with faded wallpaper and chipped tabletops. We ordered, then sat in silence. Our wedding at the courthouse in San Francisco was 48 hours away.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Matt said, eyes down. \u201cThis was an awful thing I did to you, to us. And for all the fights we\u2019ve had about money, this was a huge waste of it.\u201d\u201cBut there was no other way,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I fought you on it, everything would have imploded.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d he said.I was grateful for his apology. But the truth is that we would both be better off from what we\u2019d gone through, even if we didn\u2019t realize it yet. Matt had a signed agreement that made him feel safer, and I didn\u2019t have to fight for an acknowledgment of how unnecessary it was in the first place. What\u2019s more, money no longer felt like a huge \u201cNo\u201d in the middle of our relationship.Two years later, I don\u2019t even know where we put our prenuptial agreement, and I hope I never need to know. One thing is clear: Our fights about money have eased. The prenup was hell, but in the end it was almost as if that document became a repository for our anxieties, holding on to them so we didn\u2019t have to.Abby Mims, a writer in Mountain View, Calif., is working on a collection of essays.modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bunny Mellon Had Peerless Taste and a Penchant for Scandal", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.It starts with the name. Why on earth would a grown woman go through life with the nickname Bunny?Bunny Mellon, the wife of the financier and philanthropist Paul Mellon, was christened Rachel, after her mother, but until her death in 2014 at the age of 103, she was known by the endearment her nanny gave her. (Men, of course, have been bestowing their sons with abstruse monikers for generations: Trip, it turns out, is not a sobriquet for a clumsy child; it\u2019s shorthand for \u201cIII,\u201d as in Thurston Howell.)In such circles as the Howells\u2019 and Mellons\u2019, nicknames are passwords into a closed society that, like the mob, runs on its own rules and customs. Nobody messed with Anthony \u201cWhack-Whack\u201d Indelicato or Antonio \u201cBootsie\u201d Tomasulo, and the same rule applies in higher society. Childish names signal cliquishness and the immunity to ridicule that comes with money and power. \u201cI don\u2019t really come by to pray,\u201d Mellon once told the rector of an Episcopalian church in the Norman medieval style that she financed and helped design. \u201cI come in to talk with God because he\u2019s a dear, dear friend of mine.\u201d\u201cBunny Mellon: The Life of an American Style Legend,\u201d by Meryl Gordon, is an astute and intriguing portrait of a celebrity who wasn\u2019t famous outside her own milieu. Mellon was a gifted gardener with princely means and infallible taste: Her close friend Jacqueline Kennedy asked her to redesign the White House Rose Garden. This well-bred heiress was both shockingly extravagant and studiously understated: Her aesthetic motto was \u201cnothing should be noticed.\u201dToday, Mellon\u2019s world is, needless to say, a vanishing one, and there is no clearer sign of it than this Edith Whartonish twist: Rickie Niceta, who is married to Mellon\u2019s grandson, Thomas, is Melania Trump\u2019s White House social secretary. (Insert joke about no-show jobs here.)Like Brooke Astor, the subject of one of Gordon\u2019s previous biographies, Mellon is possibly remembered less for what she did than for what was done to her in her dotage. Astor, who was 105 when she died in 2007, had one son, Anthony Marshall, who was accused by one of his own sons of elder abuse. After a lollapalooza trial, Marshall was convicted of larceny in 2009 and spent a few months in prison before his death in 2014. The Astors\u2019 three-generation psychodrama made for a juicier book.But Mellon also made headlines late in life. When John Edwards\u2019s 2008 presidential bid was derailed by a sex-and-money scandal, it came out that Bunny had given him upwards of $3 million. She was so smitten that she funneled another $725,000 into a slush fund for the candidate\u2019s private use; the campaign used it to keep his mistress, Rielle Hunter, and their baby secret. Mellon wasn\u2019t upset by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s infidelity to his dying wife, Elizabeth; however she did balk when the disgraced Edwards asked her for millions to create an antipoverty foundation.But she felt no guilt about the entanglement. One of her closest confidants, a North Carolina interior designer named Bryan Huffman, had introduced her to Edwards. Long after the trial, Bunny would reminisce with him about their covert conspiracy, saying, \u201cDidn\u2019t we have fun?\u201dShe did have fun, but not as much as one would expect.\u201cBunny Mellon\u201d was written with the Mellon family\u2019s cooperation, so it\u2019s not steaming with leering conjecture. Mostly, the biography documents unsettling contradictions. Mellon lavished attention on the Kennedys\u2019 daughter, Caroline, but sent her own only son, Tuffy (Stacy Barcroft Lloyd III), away to boarding school when he was 8. Her lifestyle, which included houses in Antigua, Paris, New York, Virginia and Cape Cod, cost about $20 million a year. She would send the Mellons\u2019 private plane around the country to deliver fresh flowers and vegetables to friends from their 5,000-acre farm in Upperville, Va. She scoured the beach at her estate in Cape Cod for the perfect clamshell in which to encase a gift of pearl earrings for Jackie Kennedy. (She considered Tiffany\u2019s signature blue box \u201cd\u00e9class\u00e9.\u201d)But she could callously jettison old friends, including Paul Leonard, a stage designer and decorator; she dropped him when he got married. When he was dying of cancer, Leonard asked his old friend and patroness for money for his wife and daughter. Mellon did not respond. Her story is a reminder that the wealthy are often most generous to the friends who need it the least.Bunny Mellon was above all a product of her generation and class, a debutante raised to run a grand household who found her true calling outdoors in the garden. Born into privilege (her father was a Listerine heir), she went to the elite Foxcroft private school, but her father drew the line at college. She divorced her first husband, Stacy Barcroft Lloyd Jr., in 1948, because she suspected him of infidelity and turned instead to their friend and neighbor, Paul Mellon, a recent widower who was at one point the fifth-richest man in the world and even more prone to running around.The marriage was strained and at times rocky \u2014 Paul, who died in 1999, didn\u2019t go to many pains to hide his longtime mistress. One of the chief mysteries Gordon raises but leaves unsolved is why he and Bunny ever married in the first place. In his memoir, \u201cReflections in a Silver Spoon,\u201d Paul writes rather chillingly that the couple \u201chave been careful to allow each other to develop our own interests.\u201dTogether, they collected art and entertained presidents and British royalty, but they were often apart. He bred race horses; she cultivated miniature topiary trees. He was analyzed by Jung; she consulted psychics. Most of all, Bunny Mellon devoted her attention to landscaping, interior design, jewelry and haute couture. Hubert de Givenchy was an intimate friend. She was a perfectionist \u2014 she asked Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga to design her gardening clothes \u2014 with an eye for the just-so imperfection, be it a frayed antique chair or an overgrown garden path.She led an exquisitely cocooned life, but tragedy struck in 2000 when her daughter, Eliza, was hit by a truck and suffered severe brain damage and paralysis. She died in 2008. When Mellon died six years later, the auction of her possessions was the sale of the decade. It took Sotheby\u2019s five days and a four-volume catalog to sell off the vast quantities of art, jewelry, porcelain and furniture. The $218 million in proceeds went to her most cherished legacy, a horticultural research center located on the Mellon farm.Niceta said she burst into tears when she saw her grandmother-in-law and mentor\u2019s pharaonic stockpile of precious watches, broaches, bracelets, purses and rings. \u201cI felt like there had been a true hole in her heart, and she was desperate to fill it,\u201d Niceta told Gordon. \u201cShe tried to fill the void by buying all that stuff.\u201dAlessandra Stanley was the television critic for the Times.Advertisement"}

It rose to 310 million in 2009, up from 259 million in 2000 and 192 million in 1994.Gun homicides, meanwhile, fell dramatically from a 1993 peak of a rate of 7.02 per 100,000 people; by 1999, it was at 3.82 per 100,000 people. But the homicide rate has remained steady since then, suggesting the correlation between the number of guns and number of gun killings does not hold past the turn of the millennium.A flurry of Twitter posts compared spending by the N.R.A. to Planned Parenthood, two groups that are consistently among the nation\u2019s top political contributors.Among the calls for tougher gun restrictions, Hillary Clinton tweeted on Monday to criticize a House bill that would make it easier to purchase gun silencers. \u201cImagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the N.R.A. wants to make easier to get,\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote the day after the massacre in Las Vegas.It is not known yet exactly what weapons Mr. Paddock used in the shootings, but a federal law enforcement official said they included AR-15-style rifles.Mrs. Clinton has a point that suppressors also make it harder to tell where gunshots are coming from, especially as was the case during the concert in Las Vegas, with its blaring music.Given the many variables involved, it\u2019s extremely difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to determine what impact a silencer would have had. But it would not have \u201csilenced\u201d the weapons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lennar Makes Deal for CalAtlantic as Home Builders Face Challenges", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe home-building sector in the United States has faced an array of challenges, including natural disasters, a long-running labor shortage and increased regulatory costs. Now, two of the nation\u2019s biggest residential-construction companies are merging in hopes that their combined heft will help them counter those forces.The Lennar Corporation said on Monday that it would merge with the CalAtlantic Group to form America\u2019s largest home builder in a stock-and-cash deal worth $5.7 billion. The deal would create a behemoth with around 240,000 building plots in 21 states, a market value of about $18 billion and combined revenue of $17 billion over the past 12 months.Lennar and CalAtlantic anticipate reaping $250 million in annual cost savings and paying down debt obligations. But the deal will not alter a basic problem: The construction of new homes in the United States lags below historical averages.A decade after the big housing bust dealt a blow to many smaller home builders, the industry\u2019s largest firms continue to grapple with higher regulatory expenses that make building homes \u2014 especially starter homes \u2014 too costly, some housing-finance experts said. The situation confounds some people, given the pressing need for affordable housing for young families.Laurie Goodman, a director of housing-finance policy for the Urban Institute, said the nation suffered from a \u201chuge supply shortage\u201d of new single-family homes.\u201cThe underlying structural problem is we are not building enough homes and homes are costly to build,\u201d Ms. Goodman said. \u201cWe all agree that more things should be handicapped accessible and new homes should be hurricane proof, but there is a cost associated.\u201dRight now, the home-building industry is dealing with a new cost: the impact of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the South and devastating wildfires in Northern California.Eventually the damage caused by the hurricanes and fires in California could lead to a surge in construction in a handful of states. But finding the workers to build those homes could be a challenge.\u201cThe combined company will have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow available to pay down debt and repurchase shares,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist with Trulia, an online residential real estate listing firm, said he hoped the merged companies would eventually use their heft to increase production of new homes.\u201cAt face value, I was very excited to hear about this merger because inventory is hovering near historic lows, and that hurts home buyers and renters very hard,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said. But, he said, he was then disappointed to learn that the intent, for now, \u201cwas not to ramp up production but to gain efficiencies that will be used to pay down debt.\u201dUnder the deal\u2019s terms, CalAtlantic shareholders would receive 0.885 Lennar shares for each CalAtlantic share. That would equate to $51.34 a share, a 27 percent premium above CalAtlantic\u2019s closing price on Friday. The transaction values CalAtlantic at $9.3 billion, including debt.CalAtlantic shareholders also have the option to take all or a portion of their shares in cash, at $48.26 a share. The cash payments would be limited to a total of $1.2 billion, Lennar said.On completion of the transaction, CalAtlantic shareholders are expected to own about 26 percent of the combined company. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to shareholder approval.Mr. Miller and his family trust, which hold a 41.4 percent voting interest in Lennar, and MP CA Homes, an affiliate of MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners that holds a 25.4 percent voting interest in CalAtlantic, have agreed to support the deal, the companies said.Citigroup and the law firm Goodwin Procter advised Lennar; J. P. Morgan and the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher advised CalAtlantic.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Jersey Teachers\u2019 Union Wages Costly War Against Powerful Democrat", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA battle between two political titans in New Jersey could cost $20 million by the time November\u2019s election is over. And it is not the governor\u2019s race.The high-priced campaign is unfolding in a largely rural legislative district in the southwest corner of the state where the New Jersey Education Association, which is considered the state\u2019s most influential union, is engaged in a feud with Stephen M. Sweeney, the powerful president of the State Senate.It is a clash that, on paper, is perplexing. The education association, which represents about 200,000 public-school teachers, leans Democratic: Of its 105 endorsements this year, 91 were Democrats. Mr. Sweeney is a Democrat. His opponent, Fran Grenier, the chairman of the Salem County Republican Party, supports the departing Republican governor, Chris Christie, and President Trump, both of whom the union routinely vilifies.But a dispute over pension benefits that dates back to 2011 has put the union on a mission to defeat Mr. Sweeney.The multimillion-dollar campaign is reverberating beyond the district, which Mr. Sweeney has represented since 2001 and where he has rarely faced any serious competition. Democratic groups estimate they will spend $11 million to support Mr. Sweeney, while the teachers\u2019 union is on pace to spend more than $8 million. Other unions are pouring money in on Mr. Sweeney\u2019s behalf and by Election Day, Nov. 7, the total amount spent on the single race could easily eclipse $20 million.Additionally, the money flooding this race by Democrats would, in other years, be spent propping up other candidates around the state.The legislative skirmish could also imperil the agenda of Philip D. Murphy, the Democratic candidate for governor, who has a significant lead in the polls.Should Mr. Sweeney lose, Mr. Murphy\u2019s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15, provide more funding for Planned Parenthood and legalize marijuana would face a much more difficult legislative path, not just because the Democratic advantage in the Senate would shrink, but because Mr. Sweeney is an adroit power broker.Mr. Murphy, who has the support of Mr. Sweeney and the teachers\u2019 union, has chosen not to take sides, a stance that some Democratic leaders have privately complained about and that could lead to a strained relationship if Mr. Murphy is elected governor.\u201cThis is one where folks don\u2019t always, where three parties, don\u2019t always come out to the same conclusion,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, referring to himself, Mr. Sweeney and the union. \u201cI\u2019m on the line with him, on the ballot with him, and trying to get him elected, and, to his credit, he\u2019s trying to get me elected.\u201dMr. Murphy would not say if he would ask the teachers\u2019 union to stop campaigning against Mr. Sweeney.\u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve done explicitly is to be there beside him, and that\u2019s the reason I was texting him today,\u201d Mr. Murphy said about Mr. Sweeney. \u201cBecause I said, \u2018Listen, I want to come down and campaign with him, go door to door, be visible and be seen with him.\u2019\u201dMr. Sweeney said he believed that Mr. Murphy had sought to quietly reach out to the union.\u201cHe told me he tried,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to take him at his word, even though there have been publications and people saying that he didn\u2019t. Because he said he did. And I want to work with Phil next year.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable to us that the N.J.E.A. is supporting Republican extremist Fran Grenier, an avowed ally of Chris Christie and Donald Trump, both of whom have demonized teachers and unions throughout their political careers,\u201d the letter said.The teachers\u2019 union claims that its effort to unseat Mr. Sweeney is driven by its members.\u201cOur members made it extremely clear that they want to see a change of leadership,\u201d said Steve Baker, the union\u2019s director of communications. \u201cClearly, Steve Sweeney is very, very well financed. He has the support of a lot of people who have been able to put a lot of money into his campaign, and in order to run a strong campaign, we\u2019ve had to also step up and be willing to invest in that endorsement that our members made.\u201dMr. Grenier did not respond to emails requesting comment.As the race enters its final days, the teachers\u2019 union has continued its advertising blitz. Since Sept. 27, Garden State Forward, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d run by the union, has spent nearly $3 million on television advertisements, including $600,000 to broadcast one attack ad during a single week, according to Advertising Analytics, a company that tracks ad spending.To put the roughly $3 million worth of television commercials in context, that is more than Mr. Murphy\u2019s campaign has spent on broadcast ads throughout the state during the general election, according to Advertising Analytics.Mr. Sweeney said the union has also distributed pamphlets critical of him to legislators and candidates in other districts, a move that he interpreted as the union issuing a warning about what happens when an elected official crosses the labor group.\u201cThis is sending a message to the other legislators,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said.For the teachers, this was unforgivable.Despite the onslaught, Mr. Sweeney said he was confident that he would prevail. As for the future of his relationship with the teachers\u2019 union, Mr. Sweeney was uncertain.\u201cThe bigger question is how do they figure on going forward with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a grudge guy by any means. But they\u2019ve made this pretty personal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Russia, a Bribery Case Lifts the Veil on Kremlin Intrigue", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian elite, the group of oligarchs and other loyalists around President Vladimir V. Putin who amassed great wealth over nearly two decades of hand-in-glove work with the government, is showing signs of cracking.As the economy stagnates amid international sanctions and low oil prices, a high-profile bribery case has illustrated how the country\u2019s most privileged players have taken to fighting over slices of a smaller economic pie, seeking an advantage over rivals through the courts and law enforcement officials who are widely seen as vulnerable to corruption.In recordings read aloud by prosecutors in a case being heard in a Moscow courtroom, two men, both Kremlin insiders, are first heard in an assiduously polite conversation recorded by secret listening devices, even as one was preparing to doom the other to a long spell in prison.With a warmth betraying nothing of what was to come, Igor I. Sechin, the powerful director of Rosneft, Russia\u2019s national oil company, invited Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, then the economy minister, to a meeting and even called him \u201cdear.\u201dMr. Ulyukayev accepted and said, \u201cHow happy I am to hear from you.\u201dLater, at the meeting, the two exchanged more pleasantries, and Mr. Sechin offered Mr. Ulyukayev a gift basket of homemade sausages.In fact, the conversation was anything but friendly. Mr. Sechin, for his part, now contends that Mr. Ulyukayev had solicited a bribe to smooth approvals for an oil deal. In Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s telling, he had accepted the gift basket of sausages and a bag of wine only to later discover, to his surprise, $2 million in cash tucked in among the other goodies.The exchange, analysts say, is a worrying sign for the political climate in Russia. At worst, they say, the case could signal a return to Soviet-era traditions, under which service in the ministries was a tightrope walk over the gulag.\u201cThis is very unfortunate for the elite,\u201d Valery D. Solovei, an historian at the Moscow State Institute for International Relations, said of the episode, which Mr. Ulyukayev has insisted was a \u201cprovocation,\u201d or setup.His was not the first career to suffer. In 2015, Vladimir I. Yakunin, a longtime associate of Mr. Putin\u2019s and the director of the national railway, was ousted after failing to win support for costly state subsidies for the railways.The two men had been locked in a long struggle. Mr. Sechin, a close aide to Mr. Putin, has advocated for Russia to return to a state-dominated economy, particularly in the oil industry.Now gaunt looking, and wearing denim shirts, Mr. Ulyukayev attends hearings in the Zamoskvoretsky court, where he sits at a cheap, hardwood veneer table and listens to a parade of agents from the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., testify against him.Mr. Sechin says that the former minister had, some weeks before the conversation, solicited the bribe with a gesture, during a game of pool, by holding up two fingers, for $2 million, signaling his price.Mr. Sechin has accused Mr. Ulyukayev of seeking the bribe in exchange for dropping objections to the state oil company\u2019s acquisition of a recently nationalized midsize oil producer, Bashneft. The sale was billed as a privatization; Mr. Ulyukayev had objected that it could not be a privatization if a state company bought it.In a sting operation coordinated with the F.S.B., the main successor agency to the K.G.B., Mr. Sechin arranged the fateful meeting with Mr. Ulyukayeva in an office at the oil company\u2019s headquarters.It was not just that Mr. Ulyukayev had obstructed Mr. Sechin\u2019s efforts to expand the state oil company, said Igor M. Bunin, the president of the Center for Political Technologies. He had fallen from favor by delivering depressing economic assessments to Mr. Putin, also helping to seal his fate.\u201cWe have a tsarist system,\u201d Mr. Bunin said. \u201cYou cannot upset the president by saying, \u2018Your plans are leading to disaster.\u2019 \u201dStill, not all has gone in Mr. Sechin\u2019s favor. The hearings, widely expected to be closed, have instead been mostly open to journalists, exposing cartoonish details of Mr. Sechin\u2019s sting operation, such as the basket of sausages.He discusses the success of Rosneft in terms of volumes of oil produced, falling back on a Soviet-era fascination with tons of production, whether steel, coal or oil, regardless of its market value.Mr. Ulyukayev interjects that investors, who can buy shares in Rosneft on the London Stock Exchange, value the company at only a fraction of other oil companies.\u201cThe asset is worth exactly half as much as comparable\u201d companies, he says. In short, Russia\u2019s most important company is not a market success.Mr. Sechin brushes aside this objection, and then notes the gifts he has prepared. \u201cTake the basket,\u201d Mr. Sechin says, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s all, good luck and thank you very much.\u201d\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Mr. Ulyukayev says.At a recent court hearing, one of the F.S.B. agents who had organized the sting, Aleksei Kalugin, said he stopped the minister\u2019s car and discovered the bag held not sausage or wine, but stacks of $100 bills still wrapped in bank ribbons.Mr. Sechin, the report said, hunts boars from blinds and moose in a traditional Russian hunt in which gamekeepers herd an animal from the forest into a predesignated firing area. \u201cThe task for the hunter is to not miss the moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As ISIS Is Driven From Iraq, Sunnis Remain Alienated", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKARMAH, Iraq \u2014 After the Islamic State was finally driven from the central Iraqi city of Karmah last year, Sirhan Sallom returned to his home to find it demolished.Mr. Sallom, 70, has since waited in vain for help. In Iraq\u2019s deeply sectarian system, he doesn\u2019t expect much from the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. But he is angry that local and national Sunni politicians haven\u2019t come to the aid of his Sunni Muslim city either.\u201cThese politicians are Sunni \u2014 they are supposed to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re useless.\u201dFourteen years after the American invasion ended decades of Sunni dominance in Iraq, Iraq\u2019s Sunni Arabs are struggling to reclaim relevance and influence. After they were ousted from government jobs and from the military by the post-Saddam Hussein government, their powerlessness and rage gave rise to Sunni militant movements like Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State.Now that those militants are being driven from the Sunni heartland, how the government responds to Sunnis trying to rebuild their lives is likely to have long-term consequences for the country\u2019s stability and security.Since 2003, Sunnis, who make up about a quarter of the population, have lost out to Shiites and Kurds, who were both brutally repressed by an elite Sunni minority under Saddam Hussein. With Iraq\u2019s government now controlled by Shiites, and the Kurds governing their own autonomous area in the north, the Sunnis are in a political no-man\u2019s land.Hamid al-Mutlaq, who represents Karmah in Parliament, said the government was more focused on working with Iran and Iranian-armed Shiite militias than helping Sunnis rebuild.\u201cWe are now a displaced people, a completely marginalized people \u2014 and it\u2019s getting worse by the day,\u201d he said.\u201cWe have a corrupt government controlled by a foreign power, at the expense of Sunnis,\u201d he added.\u201cOur politicians do nothing for us,\u201d said Ismail Jassim, 39, who relies on donations from neighbors in Karmah to survive in his home, which was burned by militants. \u201cWe never see them, except on TV at election time.\u201dThe power of Sunni politicians was greatly diminished by the power-sharing agreement adopted after the American invasion. Under its formula, the prime minister\u2019s post, along with the interior and foreign ministries, are reserved for Shiites. Kurds get the presidency and finance ministry. Sunni Arabs get Parliament speaker and defense minister, but the prime minister is commander in chief, and Shiite army commanders and militia leaders wield significant influence.Iranian-trained Shiite militias are part of Iraq\u2019s armed forces and have battled Islamic State militants since they seized nearly a third of Iraq in 2014. The militias have been accused of atrocities against Sunni civilians, and their presence near Sunni areas has alarmed many residents. A Shiite religious flag fluttered last week at an Iraqi military checkpoint outside Karmah.Kurds have their own army as well, known as the pesh merga. But Sunnis have no national armed force, only tribal militias blended into Iraqi security forces to fight the militants.Some Sunni politicians have advocated an autonomous Sunni region, but those proposals have stalled amid partisan bickering.\u201cSunnis have no unified leadership,\u201d said Wathiq al-Hashimi, the head of the Iraqi Group for Strategic Studies, an independent research group in Baghdad. \u201cAnd Sunni politicians seem to care only about narrow personal interests.\u201dBut even Sunnis opposed to the Kurdish vote were alarmed when Iraqi forces conducted military maneuvers with Iranian troops inside Iran along the Iraq border.\u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate that kind of foreign interference on top of everything else,\u201d said Sheikh Ahmed al-Karim, a Sunni lawmaker who generally supports the government of Mr. Abadi, the prime minister.In Parliament, the Sunni-led bloc has 78 seats, roughly proportionate to their share of the population, but is dwarfed by the Shiite bloc, with 182. The Kurdish bloc has 65 seats. Parliament has fallen increasingly under the sway of Iran, which is locked in a regional power struggle with Sunni countries led by Saudi Arabia.Mithal al-Alusi, a Sunni lawmaker, has called the government \u201ca cardboard state\u201d because of its ties to Iran. He has asked, acidly, whether Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran\u2019s elite overseas military forces who has advised Iraq\u2019s Shiite militias, had a proper visa to enter Iraq.Shiites seem driven by a sense of religious grievance and a pan-Shiite destiny. Kurds are motivated by nationalism and dreams of independence. And Sunnis?\u201cFor the Sunnis, there\u2019s a lack of political cohesion about exactly what they want,\u201d said Maria Fantappie, a senior analyst for Iraq at the International Crisis Group.David L. Phillips, a former adviser at the State Department who has worked on Iraq for 30 years, said Sunnis had failed to organize as effectively as Shiites and Kurds.\u201cBaghdad is perfectly content to see the Sunnis in disarray,\u201d he said.There are a few hopeful signs. Because some Shiite factions will oppose Mr. Abadi in April, and Kurdish politics are in upheaval, he will have to court the Sunni bloc to help ensure re-election.\u201cThe Abadi government has never needed the Sunnis more than now,\u201d Ms. Fantappie said.But Sunnis could suffer political losses in April if hundreds of thousands of displaced Sunni constituents are unable to vote. If hard-line Shiite populists prevail, some reconstruction funds could end up going to poor Shiite regions rather than liberated Sunni areas.The post-Saddam era has proved ruinous for many Sunnis. After 2003, a de-Baathification program stripped hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civil servants of their jobs, including doctors and teachers. Many sacked Sunni army officers joined the Al Qaeda insurgency against American forces, though Sunni tribes later helped drive out the militants in the so-called Sunni Awakening.Elements of de-Baathification continued, however. Mr. Mutlaq, the Sunni lawmaker who had been a general in Mr. Hussein\u2019s army, said a de-Baathification commission had barred him three times since 2010 from running for Parliament. \u201cPure political harassment,\u201d he said.(He appealed, and now sits on Parliament\u2019s security and defense committee.)Under Mr. Maliki, who was prime minister from 2006 to 2014, many Sunnis who had reclaimed their jobs were purged from the military and government, some for the second time. Festering Sunni resentment helped spur the rise of the Islamic State and allowed its fighters to take over Sunni towns and cities in 2014 with relative ease.The militants promised a new era of Sunni dominance, drawing widespread support from disenfranchised Sunnis. But they failed to deliver, and the reign of terror they imposed ultimately turned many Sunnis against them.But the only sign in Karmah of the Iraqi agency charged with rebuilding liberated areas is the beginning of construction work on five schools. Mustafa al-Hiti, a Sunni pharmacist who directs the agency, said that just $140 million had been allocated by Baghdad this year for rebuilding all of the areas that had been under Islamic State rule. He estimated total costs for that job at more than $100 billion.He said international donors had allocated billions of dollars, but much of that money has been slowed by audits amid donor concerns about Iraq\u2019s reputation for corruption.So Mr. Sallom is rebuilding his home in Karmah using his life savings and the help of his son, Ali Sirhan. Mr. Sirhan, 44, was asked whether he thought Sunni politicians would soon offer help.\u201cHelp?\u201d Mr. Sirhan asked. \u201cForget help. They don\u2019t even come visit, even if it\u2019s just to say, \u2018God help you.\u2019\u201dFalih Hassan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That is the plan for the company\u2019s future under its new leader, John Flannery.Since taking over the company in August, Mr. Flannery has promised big changes, shaken up his leadership team and grounded corporate planes. On Friday, he offered new details about his broader strategy, including selling off nearly $20 billion of businesses in the next year or two, so that the company can focus on more promising businesses.The new moves were announced with the company\u2019s third-quarter results. And given the depth of its struggles highlighted in that report, G.E. is certainly in need of an overhaul.Profits fell sharply, and the company scaled back its earnings outlook for the year. In a conference call, Mr. Flannery told analysts not only that this year would be difficult but that 2018 would be \u201ca reset year.\u201dMr. Flannery said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the performance. And he promised investors, \u201cThings will not stay the same at G.E.\u201dIn addition, three top executives close to his predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, have announced their departures. And Trian Fund Management, an activist investor, which had pressured Mr. Immelt\u2019s team to improve financial performance, has been given a seat on the G.E. board.\u201cHe\u2019s sending a clear signal to everyone in the company: There\u2019s a new sheriff in town,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.The details released Friday included news that the company\u2019s cost-cutting target for next year would be doubled, to reduce expenses by $2 billion, including at the top. G.E., the nation\u2019s largest industrial company, with a market value above $200 billion, will have a \u201cmuch smaller and focused\u201d corporate staff, Mr. Flannery said.G.E. also announced it would sell off $20 billion worth of businesses over the next year or two. Mr. Flannery did not say what those operations would be, but further information may come next month when Mr. Flannery addresses analysts and investors at an event billed as an in-depth presentation of his strategy.The winnowing, he said, is intended to focus G.E.\u2019s capital investment and management time on the most promising businesses. While he said there were \u201cno sacred cows,\u201d Mr. Flannery, in an interview, singled out the company\u2019s jet engines and health care \u2014 imaging equipment and biosciences \u2014 as businesses with \u201creal opportunity for organic investment.\u201dIn the conference call, Mr. Flannery described G.E. as a company with strong industrial businesses that mainly needed to be managed more efficiently. \u201cThis is largely a self-help exercise,\u201d he said.But two of its businesses \u2014 power generation and oil and gas \u2014 are dragging down the financial performance of the overall corporation.In oil and gas, the challenge has been evident for years. G.E. decided to build up its oil and gas business, for both onshore and offshore exploration and production, just as oil prices plummeted. Mr. Immelt and his team stayed with that strategy, reasoning that it was a sound long-term move by creating a more valuable business when energy markets turned.In July, G.E. completed the merger of its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes into a separate company, in which G.E. holds a 62.5 percent stake. The revenue from that merged business is why G.E.\u2019s revenue grew 14 percent, to $33.5 billion, in the third quarter.But the company reported a 9 percent decline in operating profits per share of $2.6 billion, or 29 cents a share. That figure excluded large, one-time charges, totaling 16 cents a share, mainly for its cost-cutting programs and writing down the value of inventory. The average estimate of Wall Street analysts was 49 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters IBES.The recent drop in its big power-generation business is a surprise, and a major reason for G.E.\u2019s poor quarterly performance and scaled-back outlook for the year. The company now says it expects to report operating earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10 a share, down from the previous forecast of $1.60 a share.G.E. has industry-leading technology in its gas turbine business, especially its new line of the large power generators, each of which produces enough electricity to light up 500,000 households. Worldwide, 30 percent of electricity is generated by G.E. equipment.But G.E. badly misjudged the broad market for smaller and replacement power-generating equipment, aggressively building new machines, and inventory piled up. Renewable power sources have somewhat curbed demand for new gas turbines, as have energy conservation programs, especially in developed nations.Still, Mr. Flannery said in the interview: \u201cIt never should have happened. We screwed up running this thing.\u201dThe entire top management team of the power-generation unit, he said, has been replaced.The decline in the power business also put a big dent in G.E.\u2019s cash flow, reducing the corporate total by an estimated $3 billion, to about $7 billion this year, the company said.That has raised questions about G.E.\u2019s ability to keep paying its current dividend, which consumes about $8 billion a year, analysts estimate.In response to analysts\u2019 questions, Mr. Flannery said that maintaining the dividend was a \u201cpriority\u201d and that the company\u2019s cash flow should improve next year. But he declined to say more, noting that subject and others would be addressed at the briefing on Nov. 13.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sima Wali, Champion of Afghan Women\u2019s Rights, Is Dead at 66", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySima Wali, who fled the Soviet-backed coup in Afghanistan in 1978 to wage what she called a \u201cjihad for peace and equality\u201d by women against \u201cgender apartheid\u201d imposed by the Communists and then by the Taliban, died on Sept. 22 at her home in Falls Church, Va. She was 66.The cause was multiple system atrophy, a rare neurological disease, her nephew Suleiman Wali said.Ms. Wali had worked for the American Embassy and the Peace Corps in Afghanistan in her 20s before the 1978 coup. She then settled in Washington, where she became a United States citizen and organized Refugee Women in Development, an advocacy group, now dissolved, that sought to empower victims of war and genocide.She further championed the rights of Afghan women after the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to rout the Taliban, Islamic fundamentalists whom Washington accused of providing a haven for the terrorists who had masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks.With the formation of a new Afghan government under United Nations auspices, Ms. Wali successfully lobbied to establish a Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs in Kabul, the country\u2019s capital.The Taliban had stripped women of basic human rights and of previous gains by strictly enforcing Shariah, or Islamic religious law. In the introduction to \u201cInvisible History: Afghanistan\u2019s Untold Story\u201d (2009), by Paul Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gould, Ms. Wali wrote of Afghan women:\u201cTraumatized and desperate, they constantly spoke of severe poverty, suicide and the growing hopelessness that saw their dreams for a free Afghanistan swallowed by an army of Islamist mercenaries from all over the world armed and supplied by Pakistan.\u201dShe added: \u201cI still hear their cries. During this entire time I carried with me their pleading voices and ultimately their screams, while the world looked away.\u201dShe concluded, \u201cAfghan women were the canaries in the mine shaft, bearing witness to the inhumanity of a regime against its own citizens.\u201dWhen she visited Afghanistan in 2005 under a program financed by the National Endowment for Democracy, a Washington foundation, Ms. Wali barely escaped being taken hostage near the Pakistani border by what she described as a mob of armed Taliban insurgents and other fundamentalists.Still, she insisted that the problem in Afghanistan was not Islam but the Taliban.\u201cThe Taliban is using culture and religion to keep women down,\u201d she said in 1998 at a seminar for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, \u201cbut there is nothing in my religion that teaches keeping women at home, not educating them, starving them and withholding medical treatment from them so they die.\u201dShe added, \u201cIslam teaches us to care for and protect women.\u201dEarlier in the 20th century, the royal family of Afghanistan guaranteed universal suffrage and civil rights to women during one of several experiments with democracy.The 1978 Communist coup was followed by a Soviet invasion and a 10-year struggle to resist it, then by a civil insurgency that culminated in the withdrawal of Soviet forces and a Taliban victory in 1996. The Taliban regime was overthrown during the American-led assault in 2001, but the war against the guerrillas goes on.Ms. Wali often criticized the United States for supporting the guerrillas who had fought against the Soviet takeover and then morphed into the Taliban.Sima spent her early childhood in India, where her father was posted and where she was educated in English. After the family returned to Afghanistan, she graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration from Kabul University.She is survived by two sisters, Sohaila and Soraya Wali, and four brothers, Ahmad, Jahed, Zia and Abdul Wali. Ms. Wali was married at one time, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1987, her family said.She received the Amnesty International Ginetta Sagan Fund Award in 1999 and the Gloria Steinem Women of Vision Award from the Ms. Foundation for Women in 1989.Ms. Wali was profiled in a 2004 documentary film by Paul Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gould, \u201cThe Woman in Exile Returns: The Sima Wali Story.\u201d\u201cI no longer fear that Afghanistan will again be abandoned,\u201d she wrote in 2009. \u201cMy fear today is that despite all the initial good intentions, America\u2019s overreliance on military methods, targeted missile strikes, chemical spraying, and imprisoning and torturing suspected militants has turned popular opinion in the wrong direction.\u201cCombined with an inability to improve the lives of the average Afghan by even a small measure,\u201d she added, \u201cAmerica is now viewed as an occupier, instead of the friend and ally we want her to be.\u201dA peripatetic self-described \u201cvoice for the politically voiceless,\u201d Ms. Wali learned of her degenerative neurological disorder in 2005. The disease gradually reduced her mobility and even her ability to speak.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill to Rescue Children\u2019s Health Program Hits Snag in House", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Legislation to rescue the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program sailed through a Senate committee on Wednesday, but touched off a partisan conflict in the House, diminishing hopes that the popular program would be quickly refinanced.Funding for the program expired on Sunday, and state officials said they would soon start notifying families that children could lose coverage if Congress did not provide additional money. It was impossible to say when Congress might pass a bill and send it to President Trump.By voice vote, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill on Wednesday that would provide more than $100 billion over five years for the program, which insures nearly nine million children.The committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, hailed the bill as \u201ca prime example of what government can accomplish when both parties work together.\u201d Mr. Hatch wrote the bill with the senior Democrat on the committee, Ron Wyden of Oregon, just as Mr. Hatch helped create the program in 1997 with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.But in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, lawmakers brawled Wednesday over a similar bill to provide money for the children\u2019s health program. Democrats strongly support the program, but complained that Republicans would take money from Medicare and the Affordable Care Act to offset the cost.The House committee eventually approved the bill, by a vote of 28 to 23, with all of the opposition coming from Democrats.One provision of the House Republican bill would require older Americans with income of more than $500,000 a year to pay higher Medicare premiums.\u201cFolks that earn a half-million dollars a year and are over 65, they can pay a little bit more for Medicare,\u201d said Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan. \u201cAnd you know what? If they don\u2019t want to pay, they don\u2019t have to enroll. That\u2019s a choice they will have.\u201dThe House bill would also make it easier for states to eliminate Medicaid coverage for some low-income people who hit the jackpot in lotteries. Under current Medicaid rules, income received as a lump sum, such as lottery winnings, is counted as income only in the month when it is received.This forces taxpayers to bear the cost of providing health care benefits for people who no longer need assistance, Republicans said.But Democrats said it was outrageous for Republicans to demand such offsets for CHIP while pushing huge tax cuts that could add hundreds of billions of dollars to federal budget deficits.The Republican CHIP proposals \u201cwill likely mean more delay and possibly no action in Congress until the end of the year as part of an omnibus appropriations bill,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee.Time is running short.Minnesota received an emergency infusion of $3.6 million of federal cash on Monday, and Utah has filed an amendment to its CHIP plan that would allow the state to restrict eligibility or benefits if it runs out of cash. Minnesota and two other states are expected to exhaust their CHIP funds by the end of December, and 27 additional states expect to run out of money by March.\u201cPeople are scared, and they have every right to be,\u201d said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts.Instead of providing money for CHIP, Mr. Kennedy said, \u201cRepublicans have focused solely for months on taking health care from millions of Americans\u201d by trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Representative Ryan A. Costello, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he had heard from constituents fearing that children would lose coverage. But in fact, he said, \u201cevery child who was eligible for this program as of a week ago is still in that program today.\u201dThe Senate bill does not specify how the government would pay for extending the children\u2019s health program. Republicans and Democrats are working together and expect to agree on financing before the bill goes to the Senate floor.High-income Medicare beneficiaries already pay premiums of more than $400 a month. Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the House bill would increase premiums by perhaps $135 a month for people with annual incomes over $500,000.Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said the proposal was \u201ca first step in eroding a social insurance program, Medicare, that has for many years been in the cross-hairs of the Republican Party.\u201d It would, she said, be much better to save money for Medicare by attacking the \u201cprice gouging\u201d of some pharmaceutical companies.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, was the only senator who criticized the Senate bill, saying it provided more money than states could reasonably be expected to use \u2014 \u201ca number that\u2019s wildly in excess of what anyone thinks could plausibly happen.\u201d Some of the money, he said, will be available as \u201ca slush fund\u201d for activities unrelated to health care for children.\u201cIt is completely dishonest budgeting,\u201d Mr. Toomey said. \u201cIt is unaccountable. It is meant to circumvent any caps\u201d on spending.But senators of both parties said that Congress could not wait.\u201cIf you don\u2019t get this addressed in a timely way, you put children at risk,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cThese enrollment freezes and belt tightening and other emergency measures that states have talked to us about \u2014 they are not abstractions. They represent very real problems for kids and parents and families that are walking on an economic tightrope.\u201dAn earlier version of the photo caption accompanying this article misstated a title for Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan. Mr. Upton is no longer the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Nikki Haley, an Establishment Tutorial in Statecraft", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDiplomatic MemoGently, politely but insistently, they offered an establishment tutorial on statecraft for an administration that has disdained the very notion. The discussion was friendly and hardly confrontational, yet it felt like a deposed order seeking to influence the revolutionaries who toppled it. In Ms. Haley, they coached the figure seemingly most sympathetic to the traditional ways of doing business \u2014 not to mention the one who may assume their old job soon enough.\u201cI think also that we have to be very protective of our press,\u201d she said at another. \u201cOur democracy depends on having a free press.\u201dA former ambassador to the United Nations herself, Ms. Albright also offered firsthand advice about how to handle the world body. \u201cIf funding for the United Nations is cut and you go and try to work on reform, you are not going to be listened to because you don\u2019t have the leverage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happened to me.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t get an argument from me\u201d about pulling out again, Ms. Rice said. \u201cBut you have to affirm the things that have worked too, because if you lead with what doesn\u2019t work, that\u2019s all people hear at home and abroad. So I would just hope it could be recalibrated.\u201dThe conference focused on defending democratic and free-market principles at a time when they appear under siege both in the United States and abroad. It brought together Republicans and Democrats in what seemed almost like a meeting of the exiled bipartisan order, sharing their anxiety about Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership in the world.At this week\u2019s conference, Ms. Haley, 45, sat between Ms. Rice, 62, and Ms. Albright, 80, and gave the impression of welcoming advice from mentors. She smiled and nodded at some points when one secretary or the other urged her to take a course different than the one favored by the administration.Ms. Rice expressed confidence afterward that the encounter had been useful. \u201cI thought it was a very good exchange,\u201d she said in an email, \u201cand it did show bipartisan support for the importance of American diplomacy and for proper resourcing of the tools to carry it out.\u201d\u201cThe difference between the budget for the Pentagon, over $600 billion, and for the State Department, under $50 billion at the moment, is crazy,\u201d Ms. Albright said. \u201cWe do not have a lot of tools. It is necessary to have a functioning diplomatic service.\u201dMs. Haley reassured the former secretaries, asserting that Mr. Trump did not necessarily mean for his proposed cuts to actually be enacted. \u201cIt was just his conversation point,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was starting a conversation.\u201dShe likewise played down the possibility that Mr. Trump would simply rip up trade agreements, saying he merely wanted to improve them. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with going back and saying, \u2018Can we make them better,\u2019\u201d Ms. Haley said. \u201cI don\u2019t see us tearing up any deals. If we were going to do that, we would have done that already.\u201dOne area where the two secretaries were clearly preaching to the choir was Russia\u2019s intervention in last year\u2019s presidential election. Ms. Rice, a longtime Russia scholar, said the intervention was \u201chighly sophisticated\u201d and that she hoped \u201cwe are on top of what really happened\u201d because it could happen again. \u201cMy own view is if they do this to us once, it\u2019s their fault,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they do this to us twice, it\u2019s ours.\u201dUnlike her boss, who has dismissed the Russia intervention as a \u201choax\u201d perpetrated by Democrats and the news media, Ms. Haley agreed that it was serious. \u201cThe Russians, God bless them, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Why are Americans anti-Russian and why have we done the sanctions?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWell, don\u2019t interfere in our elections and we won\u2019t be anti-Russian.\u201d\u201cWhen a country can come interfere in another country\u2019s elections, that is warfare,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is their new weapon of choice and we have to make sure we get in front of it.\u201dMs. Rice and Ms. Albright seemed satisfied.

{"Headline": "Far Right Upsets Tradition of Consensus in New German Parliament", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe party, known as the AfD, immediately made its presence felt by submitting a petition to challenge the order of business in a dispute over a change to rules that prevented one of its lawmakers from opening the session.\u201cThe people have decided, now a new era begins,\u201d Bernd Baumann, who leads the Alternative for Germany\u2019s parliamentary caucus, said in his opening remarks.\u201cNobody on their own represents the people,\u201d said Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, 75, who has served in Parliament since 1972. He reminded lawmakers the people were watching.\u201cThe way we speak to each other here can set an example for debate in society,\u201d he said.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble recalled that the German Parliament had withstood turbulent debates in the 1970s and 1980s, over the stationing of NATO missiles in what was then West Germany and the overtures to the countries of Communist Eastern Europe.But he made clear that the expansion of the Parliament from four caucuses to six, reflected the fractured nature of and challenges faced by modern society.\u201cRarely before has a new Parliament differed more from its predecessor,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said, adding that roughly 40 percent of all lawmakers were serving for the first time.The Alternative for Germany entered into parliament as the third-strongest force, with 92 seats, after campaigning on a platform of criticism of Ms. Merkel\u2019s immigration policies and a pattern of taboo-breaking provocation, including questioning Germany\u2019s culture of atonement for its Nazi past.This forced Ms. Merkel to seek partners to secure a majority and form a government. She has yet to form a coalition \u2014 signaling that it could take until year\u2019s end \u2014 as talks with the Free Democrats and the leftist, environmentalist Greens continue.The Social Democrats, who spent the past four years in a government together with Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, are the second-largest party in Parliament, but wasted no time making clear their decision to return to the opposition.\u201cYour political style, Ms. Merkel, is the reason we have a rightist, populist party here in the Bundestag,\u201d said Carsten Schneider, taking the podium for the Social Democrats and calling for the chancellor to face questioning in Parliament.\u201cDuring the election you avoided every political dispute about better ideas and concepts, every debate over the best arguments,\u201d he added.Because of the way that seats are alloted, the current Parliament is the largest that Germany has ever seen, with 709 lawmakers, as compared with 631 in the previous four years, sending officials scrambling to install more seats and organize more office space.A member of the AfD, Wilhelm von Gottberg, is the oldest at 77, with the youngest member, Roman M\u00fcller-B\u00f6hm \u2014 24 and still a law student at the University of Bochum \u2014 of the Free Democrats, as the youngest.The role of opening the session fell to Hermann Otto Solms, a 76-year-old member of the Free Democrats, who urged lawmakers to adapt to the new reality in Parliament.\u201cThe election result on Sept. 24 changed the balance of power in Parliament more than expected and redistributed political roles,\u201d Mr. Solms said. \u201cI warn against creating special rules, marginalizing or stigmatizing people.\u201dBut the outcome of a first vote for the AfD candidate to serve as vice-president to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble \u2014 each caucus nominates someone to serve as deputy to the president \u2014 appeared to indicate the difficulties the body will face.After the AfD refused to vote for Mr. Sch\u00e4uble as president of the Parliament, their candidate for vice-president failed to win a majority on the first round of voting, forcing lawmakers to cast ballots a second and then a third time.The AfD candidate, Albrecht Glaser, 75, stirred controversy when he questioned whether Islam should be considered a religion, pointing to Muslim countries that did not offer religious freedom.After Mr. Glaser failed to secure a majority in three rounds of voting on Thursday, it was left to a committee of elders to decide how to proceed.An earlier version of this article misstated when Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble was elected president of Germany\u2019s Parliament.

{"Headline": "Iran Saps Strength of Revolutionary Guards With Arrests and Cutbacks", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 From its nine-story headquarters in an upscale neighborhood of Tehran, a giant construction company directs its operations across Iran, building mosques, airports, oil and gas installations, hospitals, and skyscrapers.Armed guards stand watch at the doors, and small posters on its exterior walls honor Iranians who have died in the current wars in Syria and Iraq.Yet the company\u2019s outward signs of strength belie the powerful currents of change that are eroding its business. A crackdown is being led by Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, who ran for office promising to unleash economic growth by completing a nuclear deal and freeing the country from international sanctions.Having achieved that \u2014 though some sanctions remain \u2014 he has turned his sights on the Revolutionary Guards, whose monopoly on large sectors of the economy and penchant for corrupt dealing he sees as a major drag on the growth he promised after completing the nuclear pact.In his assault on a bastion of privilege and power long thought to be impregnable, Mr. Rouhani seems to have the all-important support of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader. The ayatollah, who has blasted officials for allowing corruption to grow in all layers of Iran\u2019s political system, including the government, called recently for the government to reach out to foreign countries for investments and new businesses.\u201cWhat I sought is that in the economy, we must have free competition,\u201d Mr. Rouhani told a group of news media executives during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. \u201cNo institution can use its authority to derive a benefit. We must be open and fair, and there can be no exclusivity in any one sector.\u201d\u201cAll the sectors must be productive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are pushing and promoting a more open atmosphere for businesses, with open and fair competition and no exclusive sectors.\u201dFor years, the construction giant and numerous other companies and conglomerates run by the Revolutionary Guards have operated with impunity, well beyond the reach of civilian authorities, driving Iran\u2019s sanctions-crippled economy, financing its military adventures in the region and \u2014 not coincidentally \u2014 enriching the hard-line commanders and clerics at their helms.But now, with many sanctions lifted after the nuclear deal, and as the government tries to open the country to competition and foreign investment, the group\u2019s economic dominance is increasingly seen as a liability.As a result, it has had its budget cut and seen large government projects that were once its private preserve steered to outsiders. Several senior members of the Revolutionary Guards have been arrested on suspicion of corruption.The changes have unfolded steadily since the summer. In July, lawmakers told local news outlets that the government had decided to cut Khatam-al Anbiya\u2019s annual budget. \u201cThey cannot take over every project anymore,\u201d a lawmaker, Gholamreza Tajgardoon, told the newspaper Shargh. \u201cNot the ones that private contractors can also do.\u201dOver the summer, several former Revolutionary Guards officials were arrested on suspicion of corruption by the intelligence service of the organization itself, an influential member of Parliament confirmed last week on the Telegram messaging service. Two hard-line media strategists affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards have also been arrested, in a sign that their influential media empire is under siege.Insiders say the arrests confirm that the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 top echelon is now committed to curbing corruption and smuggling by its forces, which control all of Iran\u2019s borders.\u201cIt took a lot of effort, but President Rouhani has convinced the top commanders that if systematic corruption and favoritism are not taken seriously, the pillars of the regime will be undermined,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government. \u201cThese cases are the tip of an iceberg of wide and systematic corruption in the country at all levels of the state.\u201dIn line with its increasingly prominent military role, the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 budget for military and missile activities has increased recently. But its economic activities are increasingly seen by top officials as a liability.\u201cDuring the sanctions, we couldn\u2019t export, we needed goods. The Guards stepped in, and we are proud of it,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, an analyst close to Iran\u2019s leaders. He described how the Revolutionary Guards took over oil projects from companies like Royal Dutch Shell, sold oil to some willing countries and engineered complex methods of transferring cash into the country. \u201cThey brought in hard currency,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saved the country.\u201dAfter the harshest sanctions were lifted, following the nuclear agreement in 2015, Iran\u2019s economy needed fresh blood, many in the government thought. \u201cWe need a more competitive economy, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Mr. Laylaz, the economist.Tensions over the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 economic activities first surfaced during Mr. Rouhani\u2019s re-election campaign in May, when he implied that the group was the primary beneficiary of several rounds of privatization.\u201cWe handed our economy to a government that has guns, media, many other things, and no one dares to compete with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not privatization.\u201dThe Revolutionary Guards, which have sharply criticized Mr. Rouhani for the compromises his government made to cinch the nuclear agreement, was quick to answer, pointing to its military importance.\u201cWe believe that the government, which does not possess guns, could be humiliated by the enemy and surrender,\u201d the commander of the group, Maj. Gen. Ali Jafari, responded.After Mr. Rouhani\u2019s electoral victory in May, there were two high-level meetings with Revolutionary Guards commanders. As a result, and possibly after Ayatollah Khamenei threw his support to Mr. Rouhani, they seem to be falling in line.Even the conservative news media has been muzzled. Two media figures affiliated with the Guards, Reza Golpour and Mohammad Hossein Rostami, were arrested and accused of cooperating with Israeli intelligence, the state newspaper Kayhan reported. Their arrest has marginalized the hard-line media network and research group they worked for the Ammar Strategic Base, that for nearly a decade made vicious attacks against opponents of hard-liners.\u201cThere is a media war, too,\u201d Mr. Layaz said, adding that in recent months several administrators of pro-Rouhani channels on Telegram had also been arrested.It would be wrong to assume the Revolutionary Guards will be forced entirely from the Iranian economy anytime soon, said Bahman Esghi, the secretary general of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. Constitutionally, it is required to use its assets in peacetime to help with economic development, and practically speaking, since the private sector accounts for only 20 percent of the economy, the country needs its heft.\u201cThe reality is that the Guards Corps is the locomotive of our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cOur private sector simply is way too small to replace it.\u201dSince this article was published, no evidence has emerged that Reza Golpour has had any affiliation with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or the Ammar Strategic Base. Also, there is no record that he has cooperated with the Israeli intelligence organization Mossad, and he has not been sentenced for that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Warns Storm-Ravaged Puerto Rico That Aid Won\u2019t Last \u2018Forever\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The message was as stark as it was startling. Three weeks after a killer hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico, President Trump indicated on Thursday that he was losing patience. At least some of the blame for the continuing crisis is yours, he told the island territory, and the federal government will not stay \u201cforever.\u201dWhile most residents endured another day without power and many without water or other basic services, Mr. Trump upbraided Puerto Rico\u2019s leadership for mismanagement that predated the storm and said troops and emergency workers would eventually leave. Caught off guard, his advisers scrambled to reassure Puerto Rico that Washington was not abandoning it.The tweets set off alarms in San Juan, the Puerto Rican capital, where Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3, the governor, anxiously called John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to seek an explanation. Mr. Kelly reassured him that no federal resources were being withdrawn anytime soon and then made an unannounced visit to the White House briefing room to repeat the message for the news media.\u201cOur country will stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. The president, he asserted, merely meant that eventually the federal government would complete its mission. \u201cThe whole point is to start to work yourself out of a job,\u201d he said.But Mr. Trump did not say that on Thursday, even given the opportunity to clarify at the ceremony formally announcing Ms. Nielsen\u2019s nomination. Instead, his message provoked another wave of criticism from the island and its supporters. They expressed astonishment that Mr. Trump would assail the very people he was supposed to be assisting, in contrast to the tone he has taken with Florida and Texas, where National Guard troops and Federal Emergency Management Agency workers are also still helping with hurricane recovery.Mr. Rossell\u00f3 was more restrained, as he has been through previous rounds of criticism by Mr. Trump. \u201cI reiterate my plea that, as U.S. citizens, we are not asking for better treatment or less treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are asking for equal treatment. We\u2019re not asking for anything that another U.S. jurisdiction, having passed through the same situation, wouldn\u2019t be asking at this juncture.\u201dThree weeks after Hurricane Maria hit, 83 percent of the island was still without power, 36 percent had no running water and 45 percent was without telecommunication services.Hospitals are operating on generator power, which is expensive and unreliable. Although 86 percent of supermarkets are now open, the government could not ensure that they were fully stocked. And major roadways have been cleared of debris, but many Puerto Ricans are still relying on FEMA for food and water delivered to neighborhoods by local governments.On a helicopter trip on Thursday morning to Cidra, a small city an hour south of San Juan, the devastated landscape was speckled with homes that were without roofs and covered with tarps. Almost every street was lined with huge piles of tree branches and other debris beginning to rot and stink.Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who is leading the United States military effort in Puerto Rico, said conditions were only somewhat better since he arrived two weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s still complete devastation across the island,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time to fix.\u201dResponding to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets this morning that the military could not stay in Puerto Rico forever, General Buchanan said: \u201cThat\u2019s true. We don\u2019t do recovery. We do emergency response.\u201dHe also said he had experienced no pressure to start pulling out troops: \u201cNot at all, none whatsoever. I\u2019ve gotten everything I\u2019ve asked for.\u201dA former official in the George W. Bush administration noted that the federal government kept at least some military presence in New Orleans for nearly a year after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 and that the government took more than five years for recovery efforts over all.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly typical for FEMA, D.H.S. and other executive agencies to be on the ground running recovery operations for years to come,\u201d said James Norton, the former official, who worked at the Department of Homeland Security under Mr. Bush. \u201cI would expect them to be operating in Texas and Florida for the next couple of years.\u201dPuerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis has been decades in the making, resulting in $74 billion in public debt. This year, the government filed for bankruptcylike protection in federal court to stave off creditors, including mutual funds and hedge funds. The island got into its mess after bad fiscal management in which it issued bonds to finance day-to-day operations when tax receipts could not cover the costs.The situation got worse after Congress about a decade ago phased out tax exemptions that made Puerto Rico a favorable location for pharmaceutical companies and other businesses to set up shop. Some businesses left, resulting in lower tax revenue and an outflow of workers to the mainland United States seeking jobs.Puerto Rico\u2019s economy has been in a recession for about a decade, and its poverty rate is about 45 percent. Hundreds of thousands of residents may leave if electricity is not restored soon. And while many luxury resorts may be fully operational by year\u2019s end, there is growing concern about whether tourists will flock to the island when so many are living in desperate straits.\u201cSo you don\u2019t agree that it should be abandoned, is that right?\u201d she asked.\u201cOf course it should not be abandoned,\u201d he replied.\u201cShould they be shamed for its own plight?\u201d she asked.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is beneficial to go around shaming people in general,\u201d he said.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Caitlin Dickerson from San Juan, P.R.

{"Headline": "A Roadmap for Catalonia", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 The relationship between Catalonia and the rest of Spain has become a serious institutional crisis and it must be resolved as soon as possible. As of now, the situation is dangerously ambiguous, with both Carles Puigdemont, the regional president of Catalonia, and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy seemingly refusing to back down. Mr. Puigdemont announced last week that he seeks dialogue \u2014 but that seems difficult in the current state.In addition to its illegality and the violence, there is another problem with the Oct. 1 referendum: its low turnout. Even according to the statistics reported by the Catalan government, only just over 40 percent of eligible voters took part in the vote. A minority cannot be allowed to impose its opinion upon the rest of Catalonia.This state of affairs is not sustainable. In recent days, the matter of independence has divided Catalans, distanced us from the European Union and frightened away banks and businesses. A resolution is necessary.The Socialist Party of Catalonia, which I lead, has a plan to move forward. We refuse to choose between paralysis and secessionism. We do not want to see a minority \u2014 or even a slim majority \u2014 of Catalans impose their views on the rest of the population on this issue.Instead, we want an agreement that can mobilize the support of a much broader majority: the majority that wants more autonomy, improved finances and the transformation of Spain into a federal state that acknowledges its multinational, multicultural and multilingual nature. And we want this new agreement to be subjected to the democratic process of a majority vote.This new agreement, which should culminate in federal constitutional reform, must address several objectives.First, that Catalonia is a nation that exists within Spain must be recognized. Spain is a nation of nations whose sovereignty is determined by all the communities in the Spanish nation. Our Constitution should reflect that.Second, the Catalan government should have exclusive jurisdiction over issues like language, education and culture. The Spanish state should guarantee that it will defend and encourage the use of all of Spain\u2019s languages.Finally, Spain should have an equitable and socially responsible funding system in which those regions that contribute more do not receive less money per capita for public services. The federal financing system should function as an alliance between the Catalonia tax office and the federal tax administration.Though the situation remains tense, dialogue is not impossible. Mr. Rajoy has agreed that constitutional reform is necessary. But the independence movement in Catalonia is still acting irresponsibly by threatening a unilateral declaration of independence, something that could lead Madrid to suspend the Catalan government\u2019s autonomous status.That is why in addition to these constitutional principles, there is a more immediate action to be taken: new elections for the Catalan Parliament. The separatist movement in Catalonia has proved that it is reckless; the majority of people here don\u2019t want to waste time in pointless disputes. A new Parliament will be much better equipped to negotiate with Madrid and move the situation forward.This is the proposal I present, along with an ambitious program aimed at reigniting the economic and industrial sectors, reducing inequality, improving administrative efficiency and making Catalonia\u2019s institutions more democratic. In my program, citizens and their concerns always come first, and public policies are always conceived as joint efforts with municipalities.I want to see a return to efficiency \u2014 and to sanity. I want our proud, pragmatic Catalan spirit back. I want us to get back our desire for broad consensus and to reject strategies that seek to impose one group\u2019s ideas over another\u2019s. I want collaboration and strategic agreements on nationwide issues. We must take better advantage of our energies and channel them toward our objectives of economic and social progress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little-Known Pragmatist Who Is Shaping the Trump Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Justin Muzinich, a top aide to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was deep into writing the administration\u2019s tax plan this fall when he got an email from his high school math teacher imploring him to remember his old lessons and not deliver a giveaway for the rich.\u201cHe quickly wrote back and immediately said, \u2018It\u2019s great to hear from you,\u2019\u201d recalled Hoyt Taylor, a retired teacher and squash coach at the elite Groton School in Massachusetts. \u201cHe didn\u2019t respond on the taxes.\u201dWith President Trump\u2019s revamping of the tax code taking center stage in Washington, key figures within the administration who for months have been toiling in obscurity are increasingly in the spotlight and under pressure. Scrambling to get a tax bill passed by the end of the year, they are juggling the competing forces of a fractious Congress, frenzied corporate lobbyists and even voices from the past.Mr. Muzinich, a 39-year-old newcomer to Washington, has emerged as a central player in the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul effort. The former investment banker and hedge fund manager is the Treasury point man on taxes, accompanying Mr. Mnuchin into \u201cBig Six\u201d meetings with top Republican lawmakers drafting the tax plan and laying out the administration\u2019s positions on which taxes and deductions to cut or preserve. His task is about to get even tougher as the House, which plans to release its bill this coming week, and the Senate begin the difficult process of hashing out the details and negotiating with the administration over the final legislation.Brought on as a \u201ccounselor\u201d to Mr. Mnuchin in March, Mr. Muzinich is expected to soon be promoted to a Treasury position that will broaden his portfolio of responsibilities, according to people familiar with the process.The rapid rise of Mr. Muzinich, a lanky father of two from Manhattan, is emblematic of the new power dynamics in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington, where business experience and New York roots are often pathways to top posts. He fits the mold of Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic advisers, Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, both of whom made a career on Wall Street. While not a Goldman Sachs alumnus, as they are, he brings an extensive background from the world of finance, having been a banker at Morgan Stanley and the president of Muzinich & Co., an international investment firm founded by his father.Yet for all the intricacies of Wall Street finance, Mr. Muzinich has had to scale a steep learning curve in understanding the peculiarities of the tax code and the legislative land mines that have roiled previous attempts to rewrite tax law. Some lobbyists have expressed frustration that Mr. Muzinich and his Treasury team have been overly secretive about the tax plan and that, despite his business background, he does not always appear enthusiastic to be haggling over tax code deductions with representatives of American industries.A congressional tax staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings said that it had sometimes been evident that Mr. Muzinich was learning on the job in a world of tax and accounting technicians, but added that he had a strong sense of business economics, asked smart questions and was comfortable with data.His Wall Street brashness sometimes shines through when he gets into deal-making mode. Like other political newcomers in the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich has occasionally shown frustration with the grinding pace of legislating.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Muzinich is often paired with Mr. Cohn\u2019s top deputy, Shahira Knight, to convey the administration\u2019s views in big tax meetings. He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and, according to congressional aides, it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary.\u201cJustin\u2019s leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform, which has been our administration\u2019s top domestic priority,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department. His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s arch rivals: Jeb Bush.Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, another nemesis of Mr. Trump. While Mr. Trump\u2019s personality-driven campaign was lean on policy, Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes, education and health care. Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bush\u2019s failed White House bid, but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure.One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015. Like the current plan, that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates. It would have doubled the standard deduction, reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and switched the United States to a \u201cterritorial\u201d tax system, as the current plan would also do.\u201cWhat impressed me beyond his business experience, which is pretty unique, is that he\u2019s just a policy wonk,\u201d Mr. Bush said in an interview. \u201cJustin has a desire to serve and he\u2019s getting to do it at a high level, and I\u2019m really proud of him for doing it.\u201dHe grew up and studied in Democratic havens like New York City and Harvard, but Mr. Muzinich\u2019s conservative leanings were obvious at an early age. Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds. His wife, a doctor, and young children still live in New York, and he spends his weeks living out of hotels in Washington and commuting home to the Upper East Side on the weekends. A squash enthusiast, Mr. Muzinich has little time for the courts amid the crush of meetings and number crunching, according to friends who keep in regular touch with him.While many members of the Trump administration have become household names defending the president and his policies on television, Mr. Muzinich, who declined to be interviewed, has kept his distance from public political combat and maintained a low profile.\u201cI think that he is pragmatic,\u201d said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, where Mr. Muzinich taught before joining the Treasury Department. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for good policy solutions, not policy positions.\u201dCritics have accused the Treasury Department of taking a different approach. Some economists have scoffed at Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s promises that tax cuts would more than pay for themselves because of the robust economic growth he says they will create. The department came under fire for removing from its web site an economic study that contradicted the secretary\u2019s analysis of the benefits of corporate tax cuts.Yet Mr. Muzinich\u2019s reputation for pragmatism over ideology is providing comfort for those who know him and disagree with the direction of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201cI\u2019m really happy that someone like Justin is working in the administration, because to have thoughtful, level-headed people who are open to evidence, and who are able to bring complicated issues together, I think leaves us better off four years later,\u201d said Mr. Werker, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who collaborated with Mr. Muzinich on writing projects at Harvard but is not a Republican.For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk in less than three months. Early analyses of the Republican tax plan have found that it would disproportionately benefit the rich, but the Trump administration is working with tax writers in Congress to make the legislation more progressive.The final shape of the tax plan remains to be seen, but Mr. Taylor, who said that Mr. Muzinich was an above-average student in his Advanced Placement calculus class, is holding out hope that his former pupil will find a way to ensure that the poor are not forgotten.\u201cI see him in these pictures marching behind Mnuchin and I say, \u2018Oh, Justin, put in a good word for us,\u2019\u201d Mr. Taylor, a self-described liberal, said. \u201cI think people should be caring about other people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The group called on the nations to impose a moratorium on sending people back until security in Afghanistan improves.\u201cReturns are increasing, even as dangers in the country have become more severe,\u201d the report said. \u201cTens of thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and a wide range of people are at additional risk of other serious human rights violations such as persecution or torture.\u201dIn deciding asylum cases, the report said that European countries \u201carbitrarily\u201d consider some parts of Afghanistan safe. Even when the authorities recognize that a person\u2019s home province might not be safe, they say he or she could merely relocate to a safer place elsewhere in the country.The reality, Amnesty International said, is that \u201cno part of the country can be considered safe.\u201dUnited Nations statistics paint a grim picture not only of the country\u2019s violence, where officials report varying degrees of fighting across 20 of the 34 Afghan provinces, but also of the acute humanitarian crisis the deportees return to.About 25,000 civilians were killed and 45,000 others injured by fighting between 2009 and 2016, which was the highest year for such casualties on record. In the first six months of 2017, violence killed close to 1,700 people and left 3,600 others injured. About 20 percent of those casualties happened in Kabul, the nation\u2019s capital.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that about nine million people would need humanitarian assistance in the country this year, with about two million internally displaced by fighting and natural disasters.\u201cIf Afghanistan does not cooperate with E.U. countries on the refugee crisis, this will negatively impact the amount of aid allocated to Afghanistan,\u201d the report quotes the country\u2019s finance minister, Eklil Hakimi, as telling the Afghan Parliament.Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general who was visiting Kabul last week, said the refugee issue had factored into European countries\u2019 decision to join the United States for a longer commitment to Afghanistan. \u201cNATO leaving would also risk further instability in the region, including refugees fleeing for the safety of Europe,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said at a news conference in Kabul, where he appeared with the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, and the United States defense secretary, Jim Mattis. \u201cThese risks to our own security, to our own societies, and to our own credibility are too great, and they would be devastating for the Afghan people.\u201dAround the time that Mr. Stoltenberg was making those remarks, about 50 rockets and mortar shells landed at Kabul\u2019s international airport.According to the Amnesty report, Afghans are sent back through a process called assisted voluntary return, in which they sign an agreement to leave the deporting country and are then given $500 to $4,500 upon arrival in the home country.A second process is \u201cforced return,\u201d where individuals are detained and escorted onto a flight to Afghanistan.

{"Headline": "Amazon Turns on the Charm Amid Criticism From Right and Left", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On a sunny day in July, commuters arriving at Union Station, in the shadow of Capitol Hill, were greeted with free bananas passed out by Amazon employees. In a Senate building, lawmakers and their aides attended policy panels on how Amazon manages privacy on its Echo devices and how sales for small businesses are booming on its online store.The day was capped off with a cocktail reception hosted by Amazon\u2019s chief spokesman, Jay Carney \u2014 the former press secretary to President Obama.Amazon is sweeping the nation\u2019s capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period.The company\u2019s more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company\u2019s overall reputation, is a break from its past. Before last year, the company relied on a no-frills operation for more than a decade, prodding officials in Washington on narrow laws and regulations and arguing about the nuances of issues like sales taxes and copyright.The efforts may not directly apply to an imminent bill or regulation, but they allow the company to steer policy conversations that may be important to Amazon in the future. Amazon is hosting events for lawmakers, like the day of events in July, and holding discussions on transportation and labor policies for congressional staff and policy makers at its sleek offices near Capitol Hill. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other political leaders have visited Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers in their home districts, where Amazon talks up the thousands of jobs those warehouses support.Amazon\u2019s strategic shift has happened as politicians are getting bolder in their criticism about the size and influence of big tech companies. Republicans and Democrats alike have focused on issues including antitrust, privacy and public disclosure.Many of the harshest attacks have been directed at Facebook and Google, which also have robust lobbying arms in Washington. But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company\u2019s push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition. President Trump has lashed out at the company and Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive, multiple times, accusing the company of avoiding taxes among other things. The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes.\u201cThe concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon\u2019s $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy.Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201cThey are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that\u2019s helped it generate a lot of media attention,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon.Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations.

Sony said that the movie took in $50.2 million in partial international release, with major countries like Japan, South Korea and China still to come.Starring Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford and Jared Leto, the dystopian, R-rated \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d is set 30 years after the first movie, which was directed by Ridley Scott and released in 1982. Mr. Scott\u2019s film also had a shaky start at the box office. Ultimately, though, his \u201cBlade Runner\u201d became a cultural force through multiple DVD rereleases.\u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d which cost at least $200 million to make and market in North America, may have struggled because of a running time \u2014 two hours and 43 minutes \u2014 that tested audience endurance and limited the number of screenings theaters could schedule. Analysts said that marketing materials did a good job of conveying the complicated film\u2019s neo-noir vibe, but were less effective at conveying a clear plot.For the weekend, \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d was No. 1. Two other movies arrived in wide release, and ticket sales were light for each. \u201cThe Mountain Between Us\u201d (20th Century Fox), a romantic thriller starring Idris Elba and Kate Winslet and costing about $35 million to make, collected about $10 million. \u201cMy Little Pony: The Movie,\u201d produced by Hasbro for an unknown amount and distributed by Lionsgate, took in an estimated $8.8 million.Alcon, founded in 1997 and financed by the FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith, rose to prominence in Hollywood in 2009, when \u201cThe Blind Side,\u201d a modestly budgeted drama, became an unexpected hit. But Alcon\u2019s efforts to expand into big-budget event films have been disappointing. Recent attempts have included a remake of \u201cPoint Break,\u201d which cost more than $100 million to make and took in $29 million in North America in 2015, and \u201cTranscendence,\u201d which cost $100 million and took in $23 million in 2014.Advertisement"}

In a departure from his earlier pictures, Mr. Baker did cast, with some trepidation, a name-brand actor in a principal role: Willem Dafoe plays the motel\u2019s kindly and beleaguered manager.

Mr. Baker and his writing and production partner, Chris Bergoch, homed in on tourist lodgings that had become quasi-welfare motels in central Florida, and plotted out a story that mirrored a Disney theme \u2014 the young princess with an imperiled mother \u2014 told from society\u2019s underbelly. But after struggling to get financing, the pair shelved it and started on \u201cTangerine,\u201d a success that would make paying for \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d a whole lot easier.\u201cIt was probably serendipity and perfect timing,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cIf I had made the film five years ago, Brooklynn wouldn\u2019t have been in the film, so it all works out.

Mr. Baker had been looking for the modern-day equivalent of Spanky McFarlane, from the Depression-era \u201cOur Gang\u201d pictures, and said he knew Brooklynn was his gal within seconds of their meeting. \u201cWe really wanted a perfect package of physicality, the cuteness, the wit, the extroverted character trait of hers,\u201d he said.Now 7, Brooklynn lives with her mother, father and 7-month-old \u201cgoblin brother\u201d (her term) in Winter Springs, north of Orlando. While she had done some modeling and a few commercials, her parents initially had doubts that she could pull off Moonee, who, for all her adorability, is more or less a foul-mouthed delinquent. Brooklynn hadn\u2019t so much as talked back, said her mother, Courtney Prince, who is an acting coach.\u201cI don\u2019t cuss and I don\u2019t yell at somebody,\u201d Brooklynn said, comparing herself to Moonee, as she shared the Skype screen with her mom. \u201cBut I eat maple syrup and ice cream and everything she eats.\u201dMr. Baker filled other crucial roles in the unconventional, painstaking manner that has become something of a hallmark, poring over social media and approaching people he spotted on the street.The gravitational center of the film is held by Mr. Dafoe. His menschy character was created by Mr. Baker and Mr. Bergoch after they met real-life motel managers torn between running a business and caring for families on the brink of eviction. Mr. Dafoe, whose performance has kicked up awards talk, said that while he was conscious of being the most seasoned actor on set, his biggest job was to fit in.\u201cI may have slightly different skills, but I want to forget those skills,\u201d he said, speaking from Australia, where he was filming \u201cAquaman.\u201d \u201cAnytime you can kind of forget being an actor, it\u2019s great.\u201dWhile his character ended up being the grounding element of the film, Mr. Dafoe said what kept him grounded himself, and tethered to the reality of that world, were the real-life people living in the motels \u2014 including Christopher, and other residents who served as extras in the film.

In a brief interview, he also shared his latest thinking on the status of the tax overhaul, financial regulation and life in the spotlight.\u201cIt\u2019s a big week and I\u2019ve been on the phone multiple times a day, sometimes in the middle of the night,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of his discussions on the tax plan while traveling in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201dHere are some highlights from the interview.Mr. Mnuchin dismissed criticism that the Republican tax plan was for the rich, insisting that the bill would ultimately benefit the middle class the most.He contended that the tax models used by the Joint Committee on Taxation should not be the only ones to assess the plan, and he said he sided with economists who believed that cuts to corporate taxes would benefit workers more than shareholders.\u201cWhen you do distribution tables, you take a bunch of things like the corporate tax and you distribute them out,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, explaining that the lower rate for businesses should be viewed in conjunction with lower individual tax rates. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on what does this mean to the middle income in terms of tax cuts.\u201dMr. Mnuchin defended his department\u2019s decision to remove a study from its website that found workers would reap little benefit from cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Instead, Mr. Mnuchin and the Trump administration pointed to a new study by Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, that shows middle-class households will reap thousands of dollars a year if tax rates for companies fall.\u201cTo the extent that there was something that was completely inconsistent with what we\u2019re publishing now, we thought it made sense to take down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hide the fact that we took it off.\u201dRepublican deficit hawks seem to be going extinct these days, but Mr. Mnuchin said that he and President Trump remained mindful of a deteriorating fiscal situation. To sell tax cuts that will reduce revenue by $1.5 trillion over a decade, Mr. Mnuchin is sticking to the view that economic growth from the cuts will be an elixir.\u201cI think the president is very concerned, as we\u2019ve said all along, about the debt going from $10 trillion to $20 trillion,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, referring to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office about the debt trajectory over the next decade.Explaining that the revenue losses are not as large as they seem and that the acceleration in growth will be greater than many economists believe, Mr. Mnuchin made the case that the lower rates would essentially pay for themselves.\u201cFor every percent of G.D.P., there\u2019s $2.5 trillion of additional revenues,\u201d he said.Mr. Mnuchin came under fire in recent weeks after reports that he was threatening lawmakers that financial markets would tank if the tax bill faltered.But he said that he made no such warning and had only suggested that stock markets would do even better if the tax cuts passed.\u201cIf you look at the stock market, as I\u2019ve said, the stock market is clearly up in anticipation of economic activity and economic growth from the Trump administration plan,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.If and when the tax bill is signed, Mr. Mnuchin will most likely turn more attention to financial regulation and working to make changes to the Dodd-Frank law.He said that he was optimistic that there could be bipartisan support for moves that would make community and regional banks more competitive and that there was a lot of discussion about raising the threshold of $50 billion in assets that forced banks to face tougher oversight.\u201cWe think there\u2019s definitely aspects of Dodd-Frank that people think should be reformed,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of the prospects of Democrats working with Republicans on regulation.Mr. Mnuchin insists he is not offended.\u201cI don\u2019t take it personally at all,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cI have a lot to do.

She wants workers to have not only a job, but rising real wages.To date, the wage response has been notedly punk. So she hasn\u2019t gotten wrapped around the inflation-risk axle about the unemployment rate falling below where many think it can prudently go. I\u2019m a huge fan of Janet Yellen.To me, full employment will be when labor has pricing power relative to capital \u2014 meaning asking the boss for a raise and getting it \u2014 such that corporate profit margins shrink relative to labor\u2019s share of national income. Yes, I know that sounds radical.The Fed, as an institution, has pushed back against the idea that its 2 percent inflation target should be raised, on the notion that the transition to a higher target would be fraught with too much risk. I fully acknowledge that doing so would heighten uncertainty and thus volatility \u2014 triggering upward pressure on long-term interest rates relative to the Fed\u2019s short-term policy rate, as well as downward pressure on price-to-earnings multiples for stocks \u2014 but I do not see that as a compelling reason not to lift it.The Fed\u2019s operational independence is grounded in the thesis that the legislature cannot be trusted with monetary policy, as the electoral process is inherently biased to inflation, of overstimulating the economy with too much spending relative to taxation, running inflationary budget deficits.That simply has not been the case for a long, long time. Yes, we\u2019ve had large deficits, but inflation has been too low, not too high. Thus, I\u2019m not convinced by the argument that strict Fed independence is always and everywhere needed to discipline the fiscal authorities\u2019 inflationary bias.My point is that there is no reason for the Fed to prevent the \u201cexperiment,\u201d if Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress want to run it.President Trump is proposing enormous tax cuts that would add significantly to the deficit. His budget director, Mick Mulvaney, says \u201cwe need new deficits\u201d in order to get the 3 to 4 percent growth the White House is looking for. What do you think? Do we need deficits, and would Trump\u2019s tax cuts give us the right kind of deficits to spur growth?But I vehemently disagree with the idea that cutting taxes for the rich is the best way to go about increasing the budget deficit to boost growth. Increased public investment and tax cuts for budget-constrained families would have a far higher bang-for-the-deficit-dollar effect on growth. And even more important to me, personally, such an approach would be pass a smell test of social justice.Banks are many things, but at their core, they have a public utility function, access to the payments system \u2014 the highway, if you will, on which you get paid and pay your bills.In that sense, banks are not different than the gas company or the electric company, connecting you to the grid \u2014 a natural oligopoly. Accordingly, I take offense with the notion that banks should have the right to put cram-down arbitration clauses into every citizen\u2019s \u201chook up\u201d to the payment system.You really don\u2019t have a choice but to do business with a financial institution connected to the grid. In fact, unless you pay in person at a local I.R.S. office, you actually must have access to pay your taxes.There is nothing voluntary about needing access to the payments grid, any more than there is anything voluntary about needing access to core household utilities. Social justice \u2014 a theme to which I return again and again \u2014 demands that citizens have access to the court system for redress in the purchases of services where they have no choice but to buy.A fiery run on the shadow bank Lehman Brothers triggered the financial crisis. Our government had no choice but to rescue, then transform, Lehman\u2019s too-big-to-fail shadow bank brethren into conventional banks, with access to the government\u2019s safety nets.But that access came with the quid pro quo of the same regulatory restrictions as conventional banks, reducing the fun and profitability of their shadow banking game.Dodd-Frank imposed additional restraints on playing with maturity-transformation nitro. But bankers, of all stripes, still just want to have fun. They would now like not only a relaxation of the Dodd Frank quid pro quo, but also to be rid of the term \u201cshadow banking.\u201dBad Karma, you know. And they now have both a Congress and a Treasury friendly to their interests.I don\u2019t worry about efforts to take the term shadow banking out of the lexicon. I actually use the term \u201cmarket-based finance\u201d myself frequently. I do worry, however, about what the erase-it effort represents: a cyclical turn to regulators once again being enthralled and captured by the regulated.Stephanie Kelton, a former chief economist for the Senate Budget Committee Democratic staff, is a professor of public policy and economics at Stony Brook University.

{"Headline": "Republicans Are Reconsidering Full Repeal of State and Local Tax Deduction", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House and Republican lawmakers are considering alternatives to an outright repeal, including allowing taxpayers to choose between deducting their mortgage interest or state and local taxes, a limit on the deduction or a special tax break for middle-class families that live in areas with high property taxes.Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, said in an interview on Tuesday that party leaders had assured him \u201cthere\u2019s not going to be full repeal\u201d of the state and local tax deduction. Mr. Collins, who represents a district in upstate New York, is among the more than 30 Republicans whose residents make heavy use of the deduction and would be more likely to see their tax bills rise if the provision is eliminated.Mr. Collins said he raised concerns about the proposed repeal at a dinner on Monday with Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, who leads the Ways and Means Committee, and again at lunch on Tuesday with Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, the House majority leader.He said both Mr. Brady and Mr. McCarthy acknowledged that full repeal would be a \u201cnonstarter\u201d with a large bloc of Republicans in the conference, and that \u201cit\u2019s safe to say, we\u2019re no longer going to be talking about a full repeal.\u201dThe bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.A spokeswoman for Mr. Brady confirmed the state and local deduction was discussed over the Monday dinner but did not elaborate. She referred reporters to Mr. Brady\u2019s comments on Monday, when he told a press gathering that party leaders were still crafting the details of their plan, and \u201clistening very closely to all our lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, who are in high-tax states.\u201dPreserving the deduction entirely would raise the cost of the Republican tax plan by more than $1 trillion over 10 years and an additional $2.3 trillion over the following decade, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. The analysis has not calculated for alternate scenarios, such as higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans, but anything less than a full repeal would mean less money for federal coffers and could make it more difficult for Republicans to slash corporate tax rates as low as they are proposing.Mr. Collins said one possibility under discussion would be forcing taxpayers to choose between claiming a deduction for mortgage interest or for property taxes, but not both, on property valued up to $1 million.The state and local tax deduction has its fair share of critics, including conservative lawmakers who argue it is an unfair federal subsidy of wealthier states with high taxes. They also argue that it tends to benefit wealthy taxpayers who itemize deductions on their tax returns.Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, suggested that as a compromise, the deduction for state and local taxes could be retained but capped at a certain amount, in order to provide \u201ca fair deduction but not one that is disproportionately enjoyed by people in New York or New Jersey.\u201d\u201cThat way, North Carolina would be on parity with other states,\u201d he said.Even lawmakers who want to kill the state and local tax deduction have acknowledged that it may survive.\u201cI think the administration is thinking about some minor sort of real estate tax break for those middle-class families in high real estate tax jurisdictions,\u201d said Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.Mr. Cassidy lamented that fate, saying it is unfair for residents of Louisiana to subsidize wealthy taxpayers in California who write off the state\u2019s high taxes.The White House does not appear to be craving a fight over the provision. Last week, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, signaled that President Trump would be willing to negotiate on the state and local tax deduction. While he is committed to getting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, Mr. Cohn said that the deduction was not a \u201cred line.\u201dBruised by criticism that their tax plan could prove costly to many middle-class Americans, Republican leaders in Congress have assailed the study as inaccurate and they continued to lash out at it on Tuesday.Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, described it as \u201chaphazardly cobbled together\u201d on the grounds that the tax framework was still missing so many important details that would affect its cost and impact, such as how much the child tax credit might increase and which business deductions might be repealed.Asked if preserving the state and local deduction was one of the details he was willing to change, Mr. Hatch responded affirmatively.\u201cI\u2019m open to everything,\u201d he said.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

The concrete doughnuts that followed \u2014 which tried to mash baseball and football fields into the same space \u2014 struggled to effectively exhibit either sport. And single-purpose designs returned to the norm in the 1990s.But the same concerns that led to the development of those rarely mourned multipurpose stadiums persist today. Single-sports structures can often lie fallow for much the year, in some cases marooned by sprawling parking lots on the outskirts of cities.Although the cost of some new stadiums has pushed beyond the $1 billion mark, a key revenue stream shows signs it might not be the reliable income generator it once was: Weekly attendance at N.F.L. games has been mostly down this year (even before players began protesting comments by President Trump), and attendance at Major League Baseball games, while still high, has also declined slightly in recent years.But event planners often find that convention centers are better suited to their needs, with superior lighting and audiovisual options, extensive catering facilities and the ability to partition off floor space into multiple rooms, said Jack W. Plunkett, chief executive of Plunkett Research.Industrywide tracking of supplemental revenue from one-off events is patchy at best.

So they\u2019re considering ways to connect fans to the live experience.Designers envision using biometric data and motion effects to sync an entertainer\u2019s heartbeat with pulses sent into spectators\u2019 seats. Augmented reality stations could offer guests a digital backstage tour.\u201cThe traditional arena was fundamentally designed around a static in-seat experience,\u201d Mr. Mirakian said. \u201cBut the behavioral patterns for this next-generation visitor are dramatically different \u2014 they want to come into the building and have the ability to choose their own adventure.\u201dThat is a criticism that new venues are trying to address by better blending into their surroundings and encouraging more visitors. Stadium and arena planners are trying to integrate hotels, lakes, parks, office buildings and other meeting places into their designs. Plans for venues like the Chase Center \u2014 a privately financed arena being built in San Francisco for the reigning N.B.A. champion Golden State Warriors that will include a waterfront park, restaurants and retail \u2014 refer to the complexes as \u201cdistricts.\u201dHalf of the concourse area used for the Little Caesars Arena, which opened last month in Detroit as the new home of the Red Wings and the Pistons, is accessible year-round, regardless of whether an event is scheduled in the main bowl.

{"Headline": "In a Mortgage-Crisis Settlement, Did a Bank Get Off Easy?", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameCredit Suisse also agreed to provide $2.8 billion worth of financial relief to troubled borrowers under the settlement by forgiving or modifying mortgages and helping to finance affordable housing projects across the country.When they announced the $5.28 billion deal, prosecutors cited it as evidence that the United States government can and will ride herd on large financial institutions if they engage in misconduct.\u201cToday\u2019s settlement underscores that the Department of Justice will hold accountable the institutions responsible for the financial crisis of 2008,\u201d said Loretta E. Lynch, the attorney general at the time.A little more than six months later, it\u2019s worth asking: How tough, really, was the settlement on Credit Suisse?The settlement terms relating to consumer relief are complex. They allow the bank to earn credit toward the $2.8 billion in consumer help by modifying troubled borrowers\u2019 loans. How much credit is earned by the bank depends upon the types of modifications it gives to borrowers.Mr. Barofsky declined to comment on the report, which looks at the first six months of the bank\u2019s loan modification and forgiveness efforts. (A later report will focus on the bank\u2019s financing of affordable housing.)Nicole Sharp, a Credit Suisse spokeswoman, said in a statement, \u201cAs the report highlights, Credit Suisse has taken a number of positive steps since our settlement with the Department of Justice.\u201d She said the bank was moving \u201cto put this legacy matter behind it, while also protecting the interests of its clients, employees and other stakeholders.\u201dSo far, Credit Suisse is working diligently on the consumer relief aspect of the settlement, the report said. It is meeting the deal\u2019s requirements through its loan servicing unit, Select Portfolio Servicing, or SPS. There is no doubt that the bank\u2019s efforts are helping distressed borrowers and will continue to.Nevertheless, a close reading of the 118-page analysis does raise questions about just how tough this settlement really was. Indeed, the report highlights the significant benefits Credit Suisse received under provisions in a deal that prosecutors said would hold the bank accountable.For example, Credit Suisse can earn consumer relief credit for actions it would likely have taken anyway, the report noted. More troubling, most of the loans Select Portfolio Servicing will modify \u2014 and Credit Suisse will receive credit for \u2014 are owned by others. They are investors in mortgage-backed securities or rival financial institutions. \u201cNearly all of the loan modifications SPS will complete for credit will be performed on loans owned by third parties, and to the extent those modifications result in any loss, it will be borne by the owner of the loan, and not Credit Suisse,\u201d the report noted.Allowing the bank to forgive loans it does not own, which the Credit Suisse settlement specifically does, puts the bank in a position to benefit from others\u2019 losses.Here are the details. According to the analysis, Credit Suisse\u2019s current focus is to modify troubled loans, allowing borrowers to pay less than is currently owed on their mortgages or to defer payments on a portion of the principal outstanding. Both arrangements help borrowers stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure. That was a primary goal of the settlement, and it was a good one.The bank has agreed to try to satisfy its consumer relief obligation by Dec. 31, 2020.When Credit Suisse forgives principal on a borrower\u2019s mortgage, modifying the loan by reducing the amount owed, the bank receives a dollar-for-dollar credit, the report noted. In other words, for every dollar of principal forgiven in a modification, Credit Suisse receives at least $1 of credit toward the $2.8 billion in consumer relief.But Credit Suisse can also earn more than $1 in credit when a loan modification satisfies certain other criteria.Many troubled borrowers, especially those who bought their homes at the height of the real estate bubble, owe more on their mortgages than their properties are currently worth. Such borrowers are upside down on their mortgages; they have negative equity in their homes.To help borrowers like these, the settlement assigns extra credit to Credit Suisse when it forgives enough principal on a loan to put the borrower in a positive equity position. The bank can earn additional credit up to $1.25 per dollar of forgiveness granted in certain cases.The report is meaningful because it goes into scrupulous detail about how the Credit Suisse deal is working. This lets readers draw their own conclusions about how assiduously the settlement actually held the bank to account.After the 2008 debacle, prosecutors have been criticized for failing to pursue criminal prosecutions of large and powerful financial institutions. In response, they have pointed to billion-dollar settlements with banks, like the one with Credit Suisse, as evidence that they are aggressive in their demands for accountability.But letting a bank receive credit for principal forgiveness that others are actually providing is a flaw in this settlement. Allowing it to meet its obligations with actions it would have taken anyway is another lapse.Credit Suisse is living up to the terms of the $5.28 billion settlement agreement. That\u2019s to the good. But the nature of the agreement could have been stronger. And that\u2019s too bad.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

Lyft has not decided which bank may become its lead underwriter for an I.P.O., the people said.To bolster itself ahead of any public offering, Lyft on Thursday said it had raised $1 billion in financing led by CapitalG, a venture investment arm of Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet. The funding values Lyft at $10 billion before the introduction of new capital \u2014 a significant jump from the company\u2019s last valuation of $6.9 billion.But the financing also gives Lyft a new and formidable partner in Alphabet. As part of the deal, David Lawee, a venture partner at CapitalG, will take a seat on Lyft\u2019s board of directors. The investment round, which includes other undisclosed participants, remains open.Alphabet\u2019s investment ratchets up the high-stakes battle for supremacy in the ride-hailing industry.Lyft has benefited from Uber\u2019s series of high-profile stumbles in recent months to lift its own profile. The two companies are locked in something of a race for which can go public first; whichever company does will most likely set a benchmark for Wall Street for the valuation of a public ride-hailing company.Investors trying to position themselves for the best returns have put money into competing entities, creating murky allegiances.SoftBank, for example, is also a major investor in Didi, a ride-hailing company that was once a major competitor to Uber in China and is itself an investor in Lyft. And CapitalG is a sister company to GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, which is a major investor in Uber.Those relationships are further complicated by how Uber is dealing with a lawsuit filed by Waymo, the self-driving car unit owned by Alphabet. Waymo has accused Uber of stealing trade secrets after it hired a former Google employee.\u201cRide-sharing is still in its early days,\u201d Mr. Lawee, a partner at CapitalG, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to seeing Lyft continue its impressive growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Be a C.E.O., From a Decade\u2019s Worth of Them", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "Corner OfficeAdam Bryant has interviewed 525 chief executives through his years writing the Corner Office column. Here\u2019s what he has learned.Supported byIt started with a simple idea: What if I sat down with chief executives, and never asked them about their companies?The notion occurred to me roughly a decade ago, after spending years as a reporter and interviewing C.E.O.s about many of the expected things: their growth plans, the competition, the economic forces driving their industries. But the more time I spent doing this, the more I found myself wanting to ask instead about more expansive themes \u2014 not about pivoting, scaling or moving to the cloud, but how they lead their employees, how they hire, and the life advice they give or wish they had received.Granted, not all chief executives are fonts of wisdom. And some of them, as headlines regularly remind us, are deeply challenged people.That said, there\u2019s no arguing that C.E.O.s have a rare vantage point for spotting patterns about management, leadership and human behavior.After almost a decade of writing the Corner Office column, this will be my final one \u2014 and from all the interviews, and the five million words of transcripts from those conversations, I have learned valuable leadership lessons and heard some great stories. Here are some standouts.It\u2019s a natural impulse. In this age of Moneyball and big data, why not look for patterns?The problem is that the world doesn\u2019t really work that way. There are too many variables, many of them beyond your control, including luck, timing and personal chemistry.So what explains it? Are there some qualities \u2014 beyond the obvious, like hard work and perseverance \u2014 that explain why these people ultimately got the top jobs?I\u2019ve noticed three recurring themes.First, they share a habit of mind that is best described as \u201capplied curiosity.\u201d They tend to question everything. They want to know how things work, and wonder how they can be made to work better. They\u2019re curious about people and their back stories.And rather than wondering if they are on the right career path, they make the most of whatever path they\u2019re on, wringing lessons from all their experiences.Second, C.E.O.s seem to love a challenge. Discomfort is their comfort zone.The third theme is how they managed their own careers on their way to the top. They focus on doing their current job well, and that earns them promotions.That may sound obvious. But many people can seem more concerned about the job they want than the job they\u2019re doing.That doesn\u2019t mean keeping ambition in check. By all means, have career goals, share them with your bosses, and learn everything you can about how the broader business works. And yes, be savvy about company politics (watch out in particular for the show ponies who try to take credit for everything).Ms. Lubel\u2019s career twists embody that mind-set in an unusual way. She told me a remarkable story of applying for a job with the Central Intelligence Agency, and then \u2014 thinking she didn\u2019t get the job \u2014 going to grad school instead. Only later did Ms. Lubel (whose maiden name was Smith) learn that the C.I.A. did try to hire her, but that they had offered the job to a different Kim Smith.If only it were that simple. But one thing isn\u2019t necessarily more important than another. And people are, well, complicated. Better to understand leadership as a series of paradoxes.Leaders, for example, need humility to know what they don\u2019t know, but have the confidence to make a decision amid the ambiguity. A bit of chaos can help foster creativity and innovation, but too much can feel like anarchy. You need to be empathetic and care about people, but also be willing to let them go if they\u2019re dragging down the team. You have to create a sense of urgency, but also have the patience to bring everybody on the team along.Go ahead. Twist my arm.Despite what I just wrote, if you were to force me to rank the most important qualities of effective leadership, I would put trustworthiness at the top.We all have a gut sense of our bosses, based on our observations and experiences: Do we trust them to do the right thing? Will they be straight with us and not shave corners of truth? Do they own their mistakes; give credit where credit is due; care about their employees as people as opposed to assets? Do they manage down as well as up?\u201cBy definition if there\u2019s leadership, it means there are followers, and you\u2019re only as good as the followers,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the quality of the followers is in direct correlation to the respect you hold them in. It\u2019s not how much they respect you that is most important. It\u2019s actually how much you respect them. It\u2019s everything.\u201dDiscussions about different aspects of leadership sometimes remind me of Russian nesting dolls, because many of the qualities can feel like subsets of one another. But I keep going back to first principles of how we\u2019re wired as human beings \u2014 we can sense at a kind of lizard-brain level whether we trust someone.It\u2019s a predictable rite of passage as many companies evolve. At some point, the leadership team will go through the exercise of defining a set of values to shape the culture of their company. These lists can be all over the place \u2014 lengthy or brief, predictable or quirky.But the exercise raises an obvious question: Are there some best practices? I have noticed some patterns.Shorter is generally better than longer. In fact, when I ask chief executives about their companies\u2019 values, it\u2019s not unusual for them to struggle to remember them all if there are more than five bullet points. And if the boss can\u2019t remember them, will anyone else?\u201cThe best cultural lists are the behaviors you want to cultivate,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem with values like respect and courage is that everybody interprets them differently. They\u2019re too ambiguous and open to interpretation. Instead of uniting us, they can create friction.\u201d\u201cNo matter what people say about culture, it\u2019s all tied to who gets promoted, who gets raises and who gets fired,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have your stated culture, but the real culture is defined by compensation, promotions and terminations. Basically, people seeing who succeeds and fails in the company defines culture. The people who succeed become role models for what\u2019s valued in the organization, and that defines culture.\u201dAre there differences in the way men and women lead? I\u2019ve been asked this question countless times. Early on, I looked hard to spot differences. But any generalizations never held up.Sure, there are differences in the way people lead. But in my experience interviewing executives for the past decade, they are more likely to be driven by other factors, like whether they are introverts or extroverts, more analytical or creative, and even whether they grew up in a large or small family.That said, there is no doubt that women face much stronger headwinds than men to get the top jobs. And many of those headwinds remain once they become C.E.O.s.But the actual work of leadership? It\u2019s the same, regardless of whether a man or a woman is in charge. You have to set a vision, build cultural guardrails, foster a sense of teamwork, and make tough calls. All of that requires balancing the endless paradoxes of leadership, and doing it in a way that inspires trust.And while we\u2019re at it, could everyone agree to drop the predictable questions about how female chief executives juggle family and work? Or start asking men the same questions, too?A big surprise has been all the different answers I\u2019ve heard to the simple question I\u2019ve posed to each leader: How do you hire? Even in recent weeks, I was still hearing job-interview questions I had never heard before.Their creativity is no doubt born of necessity. Candidates are so trained to anticipate the usual questions \u2014 \u201cWhat are your biggest strengths and weaknesses?\u201d \u2014 that C.E.O.s have to come up with bank-shot questions to get around the polished facades.This has inspired a kind of running game I\u2019ve played with many chief executives: If you could ask somebody only one question, and you had to decide on the spot whether to hire them based on their answer, what would it be?\u201cI want to know how willing people are to really talk about themselves,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cSo if I ask you, \u2018What are the qualities you like least and most in your parents?\u2019 you might bristle at that, or you might be very curious about it, or you\u2019ll just literally open up to me. And obviously if you bristle at that, it\u2019s too vulnerable an environment for you.\u201dI\u2019ll let the human resources professionals debate whether such a question is out of bounds.But I\u2019m hard pressed to think of a better crystal ball for predicting how somebody is likely to behave in the weeks, months and years after you hire them. After all, people often adopt the qualities of their parents that they like, and work hard to do the opposite of what they don\u2019t like.The point is reinforced time and again in my interviews. When I ask executives how their parents have influenced their leadership style, I often hear powerful themes that carry through their lives and careers.She added: \u201cI like having a good debate. At first, people think that\u2019s combative. I really want to hear if you have a different opinion. There has to be enough trust to do that.\u201d\u201cI was recruiting at Babson College. This was in 1991. The last recruit of the day \u2014 I get this r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I get the blue sheet attached to it, which is the form I\u2019m supposed to fill out with all this stuff and his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 attached to the top. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is very light \u2014 no clubs, no sports, no nothing. Babson, 3.2. Studied finance. Work experience: Sam\u2019s Diner, references on request.\u201cIt\u2019s the last one of the day, and I\u2019ve seen all these people come through strutting their stuff and they\u2019ve got their portfolios and semester studying abroad. Here comes this guy. He sits. His name is Sam, and I say: \u2018Sam, let me just ask you. What else were you doing while you were here?\u2019 He says: Well, Sam\u2019s Diner. That\u2019s our family business, and I leave on Friday after classes, and I go and work till closing. I work all day Saturday till closing, and then I work Sunday until I close, and then I drive back to Babson.\u2019 I wrote, \u2018Hire him,\u2019 on the blue sheet. He had character. He faced a set of challenges. He figured out how to do both.\u201dMr. Green elaborated on the quality he had just described.\u201cIt\u2019s work ethic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could see the guy had charted a path for himself to make it work with the situation he had. He didn\u2019t ask for any help. He wasn\u2019t victimized by the thing. He just said, \u2018That\u2019s my dad\u2019s business, and I work there.\u2019 Confident. Proud.\u201dMr. Green added: \u201cYou sacrifice and you\u2019re a victim, or you sacrifice because it\u2019s the right thing to do and you have pride in it. Huge difference. Simple thing. Huge difference.\u201dThe story captures a quality I\u2019ve always admired in some people. They own their job, whatever it is.\u201cIt means that if you go push yourself out there and you see people and do things and participate and get involved, something happens,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of my great occasions in life happened by accident simply because I showed up.\u201dMr. Plumeri learned this lesson firsthand when he was looking for a job while in law school. He was knocking on doors of various firms, including one called Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt. He managed to get an audience with one of the partners, Sandy Weill, who informed the young Mr. Plumeri that this was a brokerage firm, not a law firm.Despite the awkward moment, something clicked, and Mr. Weill gave him a part-time job. And Mr. Plumeri moved up as the firm evolved into Citigroup, and he spent 32 years there, many of them in top jobs.\u201cI tell people, just show up, get in the game, go play in traffic,\u201d Mr. Plumeri said. \u201cSomething good will come of it, but you\u2019ve got to show up.\u201d\u201cThey should never assume that they can predict what experiences will teach them the most about what they value, or about what their life should be,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be open and alert at every turn to the possibility that you\u2019re about to learn the most important lesson of your life.\u201dThanks to everyone who followed Corner Office over the years. I hope you found useful lessons in the interviews \u2014 I sure did. And thanks to all the executives who were so candid with me about the challenges they\u2019ve faced and the mistakes they\u2019ve made along the way.Perhaps their stories will inspire others to learn how to be better leaders. It\u2019s not easy, but the ripple effects of thoughtful leadership are worth the effort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Republican Idea for Reducing Medicare Costs Could Affect You", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareLast month, as Republican leaders were preoccupied with another unsuccessful attempt to replace Obamacare, a senior Trump administration official issued a warning about a different major medical program, Medicare.In broad terms, \u201cpremium support\u201d means the government pays a contribution toward premiums, and beneficiaries pay the rest. In a sense, today\u2019s Medicare program already has such a structure. For either the traditional program or a private Medicare Advantage plan, the government pays a preset premium stipend (alternatively called a subsidy, credit or voucher) that varies across these two parts of the program. In all cases, stipends grow at the rate of health care costs.If Medicare already has a form of a premium support model, what\u2019s all the fuss about?The important difference is in how stipend levels are set. Today\u2019s stipends are not driven by the market, but are set according to legislatively established formulas. But the type of premium support Medicare reformers usually advocate \u2014 what people generally mean when they use this term \u2014 would use market signals to set stipend levels.Premium support models take many forms, but there are two crucial variables. One is how stipend levels are set, which determines how much of beneficiaries\u2019 own money they need to contribute. The other key feature of premium support is how much the stipend grows over time. Both aspects are hotly debated.Most premium support approaches would retain traditional Medicare, though its fate would be uncertain, a source of controversy. \u201cA lot rides on how the government\u2019s support level differentially impacts the cost to beneficiaries of private plans versus traditional Medicare,\u201d said Timothy McBride, a health economist with Washington University in St. Louis. Geography also plays a role. \u201cIf traditional Medicare is disadvantaged, that would hit rural beneficiaries harder, because a larger share of rural America relies on the traditional program than do urban Americans.\u201dIn all the scenarios the C.B.O. analyzed, stipend levels would be based on bids from Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare that reflect the cost to cover a person for standard Medicare services. Stipend levels would keep pace with overall health care costs, but they could still be lower than what many Medicare beneficiaries receive today.For example, tying the stipend to the second-lowest bid and requiring all Medicare beneficiaries to be subject to that new, lower level would save $419 billion over 2022-2026, the C.B.O. estimated.Tying it to the average bid or requiring only new beneficiaries to be subject to the new stipend would save less. In either case, people would have access to plans that don\u2019t cost more than today\u2019s. But those who opted for more expensive plans because they offer more benefits, or the traditional program because it covers any doctor willing to accept Medicare patients, would pay more out of pocket. Consequently, more people would opt for cheaper, private plans \u2014 and fewer would choose traditional Medicare.This worries some health policy experts. \u201cTraditional Medicare has been the leader in reforming the health care payment and delivery system to improve efficiency,\u201d said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cIt has outperformed private insurance in holding down the growth of health costs, but its ability to continue to do that would shrink significantly if premium support caused its enrollment to dwindle.\u201dExactly how much more people would pay depends not only on the plans they select, but also on where they live. In some markets, many plans, including the traditional program, might charge premiums close to the second-lowest bid. In others, plans that many beneficiaries may want might cost a lot more.In the premium support debate, there\u2019s a fundamental lesson: It\u2019s conceptually simple to reduce federal spending on health care, but it\u2019s very hard to do so in a way that doesn\u2019t increase costs for at least some consumers. To actually reduce total (not just federal) health care spending for everyone, one has to overhaul how care is delivered, not just how it is paid for. That\u2019s much harder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Square, the Twitter Boss\u2019s Other Company, Could Pass It in Value", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "Twitter may be President Trump\u2019s favorite platform, but Square, a payments company also run by Jack Dorsey, has had more success in recent quarters.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Jack Dorsey has become a household name in Silicon Valley thanks to his role as the chief executive and co-founder of Twitter, President Trump\u2019s favorite megaphone.People will sometimes mention, as an afterthought, that Mr. Dorsey also runs another start-up he helped found, the payment company Square.Sometime in the very near future, though, the value of Mr. Dorsey\u2019s distinctly less-sexy second company, where he tends to work in the afternoon, is likely to become more valuable than his more well-known first company, where he works in the morning, separated by a short walk between the two companies\u2019 headquarters in San Francisco.Thanks to its steadily ascending stock price, Square\u2019s value \u2014 as measured by the value of its outstanding shares \u2014 has been closing in quickly on Twitter, which has seen its stock price stuck in neutral for months. On Wednesday, Square was worth $12.62 billion, or just $3 million less than Twitter. Just a year ago, Square was worth less than half as much.If current trends continue, the two could switch places as soon as Thursday, when Twitter announces its most recent quarterly financial results. Square, coming off five straight quarters of exceeding Wall Street expectations, will provide its results in November. (By one method of counting shares, including options given to employees, Square is already worth more than Twitter.)\u201cSquare \u2014 that\u2019s a company that is well grounded for future success,\u201d said Ron Shevlin, the director of research at Cornerstone Advisors. \u201cTwitter? Who knows. They\u2019ve got a gazillion users but they\u2019ve struggled on the revenue side.\u201dBoth of Mr. Dorsey\u2019s children, as he is known to refer to the companies, bear the imprint of their creator and his careful, trimmed-down aesthetic.At Square, Mr. Dorsey has led one of Silicon Valley\u2019s more understated success stories, built from the little plastic white square that allowed small businesses to accept credit card payments via their iPhones. Square has grown into a much broader financial services company, despite some hiccups, like a much-heralded partnership with Starbucks that flamed out.Although Twitter\u2019s overall revenue shrank 5 percent in the second quarter from the year before, expanding the company\u2019s losses, at Square, revenue grew 26 percent, moving the company closer to profitability.At Square, on the other hand, Mr. Dorsey was able to build the whole company from the ground up, with knowledge from Twitter of how things can go wrong.\u201cSquare wasn\u2019t Jack\u2019s first rodeo,\u201d said Randy Reddig, who was on the founding team at Square in 2009. \u201cIt was obvious early on at the company that he took lessons learned from his time at Twitter and applied them at Square.\u201dMr. Reddig said that Mr. Dorsey\u2019s education from Twitter\u2019s fractious early years was particularly apparent in the control that Mr. Dorsey kept over hiring and compensation decisions at Square, with a focus on creating a loyal team.Through Twitter and Square, Mr. Dorsey declined to comment for this article.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s success at Square and his trouble at Twitter also tell a broader story about Silicon Valley, where the boring, back-end businesses often end up generating more money than the flashy social networks and consumer services that capture the public\u2019s eye.Capgemini recently estimated that electronic payments should grow 10.9 percent a year between 2015 and 2020. It is no coincidence that the most successful American financial start-up of the last decade, aside from Square, is Stripe, which helps online businesses take payments.Beyond just payments, though, Square has taken aim at the much larger goal of providing a tech-savvy alternative to the big banks, expanding out from payments to lending and online deposits.This summer, Square applied for a bank charter in Utah, one of just three so-called fintech firms to take such a bold step (the others are Social Finance and Varo).Square is most visibly positioned to use a bank license with its business customers, but the company has also been building more banklike services for consumers, most notably with its app Square Cash.Square Cash is often described as a competitor and imitator of Venmo, the popular app owned by PayPal that makes it possible for friends to send one another payments by smartphone.In recent months, though, Square Cash has quietly bypassed Venmo to become the most frequently downloaded financial app of any kind on both Apple and Android phones, according to Apptopia. At various points over the past week, Square Cash was ahead of Venmo and Twitter on the charts of the most downloaded iPhone apps.The big banks had aimed to challenge Venmo with their own service, Zelle, but that has not posed a credible challenge to either Venmo or Square Cash so far, the rankings show.Mr. Dorsey and his team made several early design choices with Square Cash that helped make it different from Venmo. As would be expected from Mr. Dorsey, Square\u2019s app has a clean, green interface, compared with Venmo\u2019s busy blue dashboard.Square also made an apparently boring technical decision, to use the debit card networks rather than bank transfers, to move money around. That has made it easier for Square Cash to put money instantly into the bank accounts of its users, and to collect a fee for the service.These differences appear to have made Square Cash more popular with lower-income customers who more often need instant access to their money and who don\u2019t have as wide a variety of credit cards and other financial options.\u201cWe are reaching an audience that may not have a bank account or may not have a full suite of services from a bank,\u201d Mr. Dorsey told analysts last quarter.The shift in people using Square Cash as something more like a bank account has been an important one for Square\u2019s bottom line. While Square and PayPal generally don\u2019t make money when customers send money to one another, they can take a cut when customers start using the service to make payments at stores.This all looks like a similar playbook to the one Square used with its original credit card dongle, starting with a simple service for an underserved audience and then building from there.Keith Rabois, who was the chief operating officer at Square until 2013, said that the Cash app reflects Mr. Dorsey\u2019s ability to make deceptively simple products that answer a complicated need.Even though the revenue from Cash is small compared with the money that Square pulls in from businesses, Mr. Rabois said that \u201cit may be the most important thing Square is working on.\u201dDuring Mr. Rabois\u2019s tenure at Square, the future did not always look so bright. The company\u2019s first attempt at a consumer application, Square Wallet, never took off and was discontinued, bringing down the Starbucks partnership with it.Many analysts also expected that Square would have to reduce the price it charged businesses to process credit card transactions as it began working with larger businesses that had more options.Over time, though, Square has been able to keep its prices stable by offering its business customers other services, such as payroll and scheduling.A KeyBanc analyst recently polled 20 businesses that use Square and found that most of them had been offered lower card transaction fees by other companies but passed them up because of the add-ons that Square offers.One of the most profitable such services is Square Capital, which offers small loans to businesses. The revenue from these loans has been increasing faster than the overall growth of the company and has Square looking more like a bank every day.These days, one of the biggest concerns that analysts voice about Square is the time that Mr. Dorsey has to spend on Twitter, with all its problems.During a talk at Silicon Valley\u2019s Computer History Museum in August, Mr. Dorsey said he thought he had proved that he didn\u2019t need to make a choice between the two.\u201cThey both have different needs and are in different phases,\u201d he said. \u201cFocusing on one thing doesn\u2019t mean you completely lose sight of something else.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the firm where Ron Shevlin is the director of research. It is Cornerstone Advisors, not Capstone Advisors. The article also misstated how Jack Dorsey divides his workday. He typically works at Square in the afternoon and Twitter in the morning, not the other way around.Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter @nathanielpopperAdvertisement"}

Mortgage lenders need to know your credit standing when they consider whether to give you a loan, and while other credit-reporting companies can provide a merged report, Equifax is a major go-to source for that information.This is a very big business for Equifax. The mortgage solutions unit generated $142 million in operating revenue last year, up 15 percent from 2015. The unit accounted for 11.5 percent of Equifax\u2019s operating revenue last year.Here\u2019s the background. Both Freddie Mac and the other government-sponsored mortgage finance company, Fannie Mae, have automated underwriting systems that are meant to make their loan guarantee or purchasing processes work smoothly and quickly. Mortgage lenders rely on them heavily.A borrower\u2019s credit standing is a crucial piece of the information that flows into these systems. While Equifax and the other big credit-reporting agencies dominate, a group of about 40 other firms also provide lenders with credit information. In addition to supplying merged credit reports as Equifax does, these firms often provide more detailed information, including verification of a borrower\u2019s employment, and past payments to utilities, phone companies and landlords.That is what comes of having little or no competition. Which is why it is troubling that Freddie Mac has decided to allow Equifax to ban dozens of rival credit-reporting companies from one part of its automated system.Naturally, a borrower\u2019s credit history goes into this system. But Freddie Mac assigned gatekeeper status to Equifax, essentially allowing it to bar an array of competing firms from providing credit information during the process.This change hurts competitors by ensuring that what could be their business goes to Equifax instead. But it may also harm certain borrowers. Because of the more efficient services the other firms often provide, preventing them from participating could make it more difficult for borrowers with errors on their credit histories to correct them in time to secure a mortgage.Interestingly, an internal Freddie Mac email indicates that Equifax drove the decision to keep independent companies, known as technical affiliates, out of the system.\u201cEquifax chose not to make adjustments to be able to accommodate the T.A.s,\u201d wrote an official in Freddie Mac\u2019s Vendor Technology Integration unit. Because Equifax \u201cchose not to add functionality to support,\u201d she added, \u201cwe were unable to support as a result.\u201dI asked Equifax why it was keeping so many competitors, most of them smaller, off the Freddie Mac system. Wyatt Jefferies, a spokesman, did not respond directly, saying only that Equifax \u201coperated within existing Fair Credit Reporting Act guidelines\u201d with all the independent companies.In light of the recent data breach at Equifax and deep consumer unease about the company\u2019s practices, I thought Freddie Mac might be rethinking its granting Equifax what amounts to most favored nation status.It is not. Chad Wandler, a Freddie Mac spokesman, said that having access to a broad network of credit-report providers \u201chas not been cited as a priority for those customers who use our quality control tools like Loan Quality Advisor.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will continue to listen to our customers to provide the functionality they need.\u201dNaturally, this does not sit well with independent credit-reporting companies.Amid all this, it is noteworthy that Equifax imposes higher costs than competitors for some of its credit-reporting services. In an Equifax email in September 2016 about a price increase at the company, an employee said that it charged its competitors, who must buy the information, two to three times the combined costs charged by Experian and TransUnion.Mr. Jefferies, the Equifax spokesman, declined to comment on the agency\u2019s pricing. But he said in a statement that the company\u2019s price adjustments \u201creflect investments we are making to ensure we are delivering market-leading innovation and technology to customers.\u201dUnlike its competitors, Equifax also charges more for a type of credit report used by housing counselors who work with troubled consumers to get their finances back on track.There are two types of credit reports \u2014 a \u201chard pull\u201d and a \u201csoft pull.\u201d A hard pull is requested by a lender looking to extend credit to a consumer. A soft pull, by contrast, is used by loan counselors to get a fix on a consumer\u2019s credit standing.Most credit-reporting companies charge the same for both types of reports. Not Equifax. It charges twice as much for a soft pull as it does for a hard pull, housing counselors said.Mr. Jefferies of Equifax declined to comment on this practice.Let\u2019s have a show of hands out there. How many think Equifax should have even more control and sway in the credit reporting industry than it already has?Noted.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Victoria, British Columbia", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate13 PhotosA WATERFRONT ESTATE IN VICTORIA$4.4 MILLION (5.49 MILLION CANADIAN) This contemporary waterfront house is in a wooded enclave of Victoria, the capital of British Columbia, on the southeastern tip of Vancouver Island, off the Pacific Coast of Canada.It is on 1.3 landscaped acres facing Haro Strait, between the United States and Canada, near Cadboro Bay. Built in 1983, it is in the Ten Mile Point neighborhood, where there are many estates of an acre or more, and is close to parks, beaches and the University of Victoria.The two-level structure is around 5,120 square feet, with five bedrooms and four and a half baths. The foyer, on the main level, has exposed wood beams and nearly 14-foot vaulted ceilings.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a dramatic feel when you come in \u2014 you can see through to the ocean,\u201d said Lisa Williams, an agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Canada, the listing broker. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of natural light in the house, with many oversize windows.\u201d The owners, who are from China, bought the house about two years ago, she said, and have made extensive renovations.Off the foyer are the dining and living rooms, both of which have walls of windows and are anchored by a fireplace. There is also an open area with a skylight that includes a family room and kitchen; two rambling decks \u2014 1,959 square feet in all \u2014 flank this space, with one deck facing the strait.The kitchen has stainless-steel appliances, black granite counters, wood cabinetry and a separate breakfast nook. Nearby are a double pantry, laundry and powder rooms, and a mudroom that connects to a three-car garage.The master suite is on the main level, with two walk-in closets, a spacious bathroom with a soaking tub, and an office or den area currently used as a yoga studio. The other bedrooms and baths are on the lower level, along with a large exercise room; all are connected to a sprawling covered patio. A kidney-shaped pool with a slide faces the strait. Nearby is a small structure with a changing room, shower and storage area.MARKET OVERVIEWLast year \u201cwas just off the charts,\u201d said Mr. Balabanian, who is also president of the Victoria Real Estate Board. He attributed that to a combination of low interest rates, a healthy economy and pent-up demand.Sales volume is moderately lower so far this year, he said, though prices are up. \u201cIt\u2019s still a good, brisk market.\u201dMost buyers can expect to pay between around 500,000 and 1 million Canadian dollars (or around $400,000 to $800,000) for a single-family home, Mr. Balabanian said, with prices starting in the mid- to high-200,000s (or around $200,000 and up) for a small condominium inland, and as much as 12 million (or $9.6 million) for a waterfront estate.WHO BUYS IN VICTORIAMost buyers in Victoria and elsewhere on Vancouver Island are Canadian.\u201cForeigners are not a driving force in the market,\u201d Mr. Balabanian said. \u201cThey make up only about 5 percent.\u201dThose who do buy real estate in Victoria are usually from the United States or Asia, with a smaller number from Europe, and they are often buying retirement or second homes, he said, though \u201cmany Chinese buyers are purchasing condos for their children to go to school; it is a bit of a mix.\u201dBuyers are drawn to Vancouver Island\u2019s year-round temperate climate, beaches, mountains and terrain, all of which make it a popular tourist destination. And fees are few: A 15 percent property tax on foreign buyers, instituted by British Columbia about a year ago, does not apply to the island (though it does apply to the greater Vancouver area).BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers, although local financing can be difficult to obtain.Agents recommend hiring a qualified local lawyer early on in the process to assist in reviewing the contract and to help with due diligence, which includes investigating the title and inspecting the property.\u201cThe land title system in B.C.\u201d \u2014 or British Columbia \u2014 \u201cis a leading-edge, world-class system: It\u2019s very fast, efficient and accurate,\u201d Mr. Velletta said, adding that real estate transactions are often completed quickly.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, French; dollar (1 Canadian dollar = $0.80)TAXES AND FEESThe seller typically pays the sales commission, which on this house is 6 percent of the first 100,000 Canadian dollars of the sale and 3 percent of the balance. Transaction costs for buyers include the home inspection, lawyer fees and other closing expenses.The buyer also pays a property transfer tax on the sale price, which is 1 percent on the first 200,000 Canadian dollars, 2 percent of the price up to 2 million and 3 percent above 2 million. (If this house sold for its asking price, for example, the tax would total 142,700 Canadian dollars, or around $114,000.)CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Build War Chests to Finance a Self-Driving Future", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers are showing a new sense of bottom-line discipline as they angle for any advantage in the race with Silicon Valley, and one another, to develop the cars of the future.This week, the companies \u2014 General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler \u2014 reported earnings that highlighted the underlying strengths in their basic business of building mass-market vehicles, particularly hot-selling trucks and sport-utility vehicles.Ford was the latest to weigh in, announcing Thursday that robust sales of its bellwether F-series pickup had fueled a $1.6 billion profit for the third quarter, a 63 percent increase over the same period a year ago.And like General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, which reported their results earlier in the week, Ford needs to keep squeezing more profits from mainstream products to finance the new technology necessary for electric and self-driving models.\u201cWe are committed to transforming our business,\u201d Mr. Hackett said of his company\u2019s efforts to bring new driverless technology to market. Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.It was just eight years ago that both G.M. and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid \u2014 but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies. The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.The results drew praise from one analyst because of the company\u2019s aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value. \u201cFiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldn\u2019t make money,\u201d the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Ford\u2019s shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years. An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico \u2014 could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V. lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nation\u2019s largest automaker. The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe. Moreover, G.M. slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.G.M.\u2019s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated \u201cthe resilience of our core business\u201d in the face of declining consumer demand. \u201cThis was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes,\u201d he said.But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models. \u201cThe market is more challenging than expected,\u201d Mr. Stevens said.Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars. G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruise\u2019s work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment. And G.M. is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States. \u201cAbsolutely, we are going to be looking globally,\u201d she said.\u201cWe\u2019re not laggards here,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on an analyst call. \u201cWe\u2019ve just chosen our spot carefully before we started playing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Suffolk Prosecutor Charged With Obstructing Police Assault Investigation", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThomas J. Spota, the Suffolk County district attorney, and his top anti-corruption prosecutor were charged on Wednesday with witness tampering and obstructing a federal investigation into the beating of a suspect by the county\u2019s former police chief.Criminal charges against a sitting district attorney are rare, but Mr. Spota and his office have been under scrutiny for years, and the indictment on Wednesday was the latest turn in a federal investigation that has transfixed Long Island and led to the downfall of the county police chief, James Burke.Federal investigators began their inquiry in Suffolk County after the December 2012 arrest of a heroin user named Christopher Loeb, who financed his habit by breaking into cars. By chance, one of the vehicles belonged to Mr. Burke, the police chief. From the vehicle, Mr. Loeb stole a duffel bag that contained cigars, pornographic DVDs and sex toys.Chief Burke, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Spota and a polarizing figure among county leaders, was apparently enraged by the theft.In an indictment unsealed on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Central Islip, N.Y., federal prosecutors accused Mr. Spota, 76, and Christopher McPartland, 51, one of the district attorney\u2019s top deputies, of participating in that cover-up. Federal prosecutors accused them of holding a series of meetings and phone conversations with Mr. Burke and other police officers in which they agreed to conceal Mr. Burke\u2019s role in the assault and to impede the federal investigation.Mr. Spota remains in office, but he had already announced that he would not seek re-election in November. Mr. Spota has been district attorney since 2002, and he initially earned praise for pursuing corrupt officials in local towns, and for spearheading an inquiry into how Roman Catholic Church officials on Long Island had protected pedophile priests.Mr. Spota and Mr. Burke had been close for years. They met in the late 1970s, when Mr. Burke, then a teenager, was the star witness in a murder case involving a 13-year-old boy whose body was found with six rocks jammed down his throat. Mr. Spota, then an assistant district attorney, prosecuted the case.Mr. Burke went on to become a police officer, and after Mr. Spota was elected district attorney he brought Mr. Burke to his office as a top investigator, and later pushed him as a candidate to become the top uniformed officer on the county police force, which is overseen by a civilian commissioner. With Mr. Spota\u2019s backing, Mr. Burke became the chief in 2012.He was initially a relatively popular figure: a gregarious lawman, complete with mustache and lit cigar, who spoke of bringing modern police management techniques to the department.But Mr. Burke also launched a number of questionable investigations, some involving dubious surveillance methods. A federal prosecutor in late 2015 described one of his acts \u2014 having a GPS device installed on the car of a rival police official \u2014 as \u201csomething out of the K.G.B.\u201dInvestigators, along with the Suffolk County district attorney\u2019s office, at one point spurned help from the F.B.I. amid an investigation into a serial killer who was dumping the bodies of murdered prostitutes along a desolate stretch of roadway near Gilgo Beach.But it was not one of these high-profile cases that led to his undoing. Instead, it was his decision to confront and rough up Mr. Loeb, the heroin user who had stolen the bag of pornography and sex toys from his car. Initially, Mr. Loeb was prosecuted in Suffolk County, where Mr. McPartland, a high-ranking lawyer in Mr. Spota\u2019s office, handled the case. Later, the prosecution of Mr. Loeb was handed off to a special prosecutor, an assistant district attorney in Queens, who secured a conviction.Court papers unsealed on Wednesday accuse both Mr. Spota and Mr. McPartland of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses. But the papers, filed by federal prosecutors, offer little detailed information beyond accusing Mr. Spota and Mr. McPartland of pressuring several unnamed witnesses to lie to federal agents, to give false testimony under oath, and to withhold information from grand jurors.\u201cInstead of upholding their oaths, these defendants allegedly abused the power of the Suffolk County district attorney\u2019s office,\u201d Bridget M. Rohde, the acting United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement.On Wednesday, Mr. Spota entered a not guilty plea.Outside of the federal courthouse in Central Islip, Mr. Spota\u2019s attorney, Alan Vinegrad, asserted his client\u2019s innocence.\u201cTom Spota committed no crime,\u201d Mr. Vinegrad said. \u201cIn fact, for many years of a very long and distinguished career, Tom had worked hard to investigate and prosecute crime, and deliver justice to the residents of Suffolk County. Tom categorically denies the government\u2019s charges, and he looks forward to vindicating himself in court.\u201dArielle Dollinger contributed reporting, and Susan Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

His title speaks to the bountiful harvest since.He also dismissively suggests that \u201cthere had been little physical change to the city for nearly a half century\u201d in the desert of urban planning between Moses and himself.After inheriting a city shaken by the 9/11 terrorist attack, Mr. Bloomberg boldly planned beyond survival and recovery, Mr. Doctoroff argues.\u201cOn paper, we were probably among the least-prepared administrations in history,\u201d he writes, but \u201cby the time Mike Bloomberg completed his third term at the end of 2013, New York was in remarkable shape.\u201dHis metric for that boom was growth, of the city\u2019s population and its budget, to record heights. Inequality grew, too (\u201cwe could have done more to respond to the growing pressure faster,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff acknowledges).Taking a cue from Machiavelli if not Moses, he concludes that it is better for a statesman to be respected and trusted than loved (although Mr. Doctoroff writes that he was surprised at the supposedly coldhearted mayor\u2019s response when asked whether the city\u2019s collective scorn bothered him. \u201cHow could it not?\u201d Mr. Bloomberg replied).Moses left neighborhoods that were shells of their former selves. In contrast, Mr. Doctoroff writes that his plans to develop 130 million square feet of commercial and residential space, two stadiums, a subway extension, 2,400 acres of parks, affordable housing for about 500,000 people and reviving the waterfront displaced only about 400 residents.Publicly, Mr. Doctoroff was most closely associated with a major public policy failure: an imaginative campaign to lure the 2008 Olympics to New York, in large part by shoehorning a combined football stadium and convention hall onto a platform over the Midtown West railroad tracks known today as Hudson Yards.Mr. Doctoroff now allows as how the private commercial development of Hudson Yards could not have occurred had the stadium been built (and that the stadium, like a new convention center, should have been shifted to Flushing Meadows in Queens). But he insists that the stadium was more a means than an end.\u201cI am often asked if pursuing the stadium on the West Side was a mistake,\u201d he writes. \u201cI still think it was the right thing to do. I don\u2019t think the Hudson Yards rezoning, the subway extension, and all of the other investment would have happened if the Olympic catalyst and its strict timetable, which got the rezoning and subway financing done by 2005, hadn\u2019t existed \u2013 and our rationale for focusing on the West Side was the stadium.\u201dMr. Doctoroff\u2019s combined memoir and manifesto, written with Leslie Kaufman, a former New York Times business reporter, graciously shares credit with former colleagues and other public figures (Kevin Sheekey, Edward Skyler, Jay Kriegel, Richard Ravitch, to name a few).He also points fingers at duplicitous antagonists in Albany, where his plans for the stadium and congestion-pricing were both scuttled.His targets include Sheldon Silver, the former New York Assembly speaker (who had \u201ca special relationship\u201d with Madison Square Garden, whose parent company, Cablevision, opposed the stadium); Gov. George E. Pataki (\u201cwe had been screwed by the governor and never really knew it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlbany is a hall of mirrors\u201d); and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani (\u201cthe city planning, housing and economic development agencies under his watch had atrophied.\u201d)For better or worse, Mr. Silver finally killed the Bloomberg administration\u2019s hubristic and clumsy crusade for the stadium in 2005. Mr. Silver also later doomed congestion pricing, but only after City Hall had mounted a more constructive campaign in which Mr. Doctoroff enlisted his colleagues and, unlike Moses, solicited the views of affected New Yorkers.\u201cMaybe I had learned something over the past five years,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff conceded. \u201cI listened.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could a Perfect Tax Storm Strike Your Condo?", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by360 ViewDeath and taxes are unavoidable, but at least with taxes you expect to have a rough idea of what will be demanded. But buy an apartment in a new building and a year or two down the road, you might find yourself staring at a tax bill that looks pretty different from the number tossed around at the open house.Take the $2.1 million, three-bedroom penthouse that Laura Ljungkvist and Paul Reimer bought on Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, in 2015. The StreetEasy listing tallied the monthly taxes at an enviable $223. The Schedule A, a section of the condo offering plan that buyers use to figure out carrying costs, provided the same estimate.Flash forward two years, and the couple now pay around $1,500 a month in taxes, about $18,000 a year, and that\u2019s with a 421a tax abatement for the building, which effectively cuts their taxes by a third, but phases out over 15 years. If it weren\u2019t for the tax break, Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist would owe $28,000 a year in taxes on their 1,589-square-foot property with a terrace.\u201cAs bad as it is now, it\u2019s going to get far worse,\u201d said Mr. Reimer, 63, an executive vice president at a property and construction consultancy.Since Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist, 52, an artist, own one of the largest units in the building, they are responsible for a bigger share of the tax burden and are largely alone in their angst. Most of their neighbors in the eight-unit condo have smaller apartments, and so even though their assessments have also gone up, the abatement covers most of their taxes.A collision of factors has led Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist to this point. The tax projections in the offering plan were overly optimistic given that they live in an area in the midst of rapid residential growth and skyrocketing property values. The plan was also vague about the limits of their tax abatement. While someone who is buying an older apartment can scour years of tax history to anticipate how high taxes might go, Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist had to rely on the limited tax predictions in the offering plan. It is not clear how common it is for buyers to experience a confluence of events like this \u2014 a perfect storm.Predicting the future, of course, is not a simple task. A tax lawyer or tax consultant prepares an opinion letter that calculates what taxes would likely be the first year the building is operational, often two or more years before a condo opens. But a lot can change in two years, particularly in a neighborhood where dozens of new residential buildings are popping up around the same time. First-budget-year taxes, which are what you see in the Schedule A, can also be surprisingly low because there is a good chance that the property was under construction for part or most of that time and therefore not assessed as a fully operational condo.Walk into an open house and the brochure you pick up will include the Schedule A tax estimate, not a bad number to use if you\u2019re trying to sell an apartment. Brokers \u201cwant to sell the units,\u201d Mr. Korngold said. \u201cThey want to show low taxes.\u201d So brokers work with the information in the Schedule A. For a fuller picture of what you will eventually owe, you or your lawyer have to thumb through the offering plan to find that tax opinion letter.But the letter predicts taxes only for the first year that the building is fully operational. After that first year, a buyer is on his or her own. The city, meanwhile, reassesses properties every year and assessments and taxes usually only go in one direction \u2014 up.Yes, taxes rise, but the letter in Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist\u2019s offering plan, prepared in 2013 by Metropolitan Realty Exemptions, a Brooklyn company, seems to have left out some details. For example, on the 421a abatement, the letter said any increase in assessed value \u201cshall be exempt from property taxes.\u201d Yet, the tax exemption only covers around $84,000 in assessed value, so anything over that would be subject to regular taxes. While most of the other apartments in the building are assessed at around $84,000, the home of Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist has been assessed at $135,505.The letter also calculated $17,853 in residential taxes for the entire building, based on a projection of how the city would assess the property once construction finished. But two years later, Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist are on the hook for more than that amount just for their one unit. In other words, the estimate was really low compared with reality, and neither the couple, nor their lawyer, saw a red flag.Calls to Metropolitan Realty Exemptions for comment were not returned.But sometimes the fine print is not enough. For Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist, the information they received did not prepare them for reality. The couple are now concerned that as the tax abatement dwindles, so, too, will the equity in their home. \u201cIf we had known\u201d that the taxes would rise so high, Ms. Ljungkvist said, \u201cwe never would have bought this place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Affordable Care Act\u2019s Future Cloudy, Costs for Many Seem Sure to Soar", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHealth insurers are aggressively increasing prices next year for individual policies sold under the federal health care law, with some raising premiums by more than 50 percent.By approving such steep increases for 2018 in recent weeks, regulators in many states appeared to be coaxing companies to hang in there, despite turmoil in the market and continuing uncertainty in Congress about the future of the law, the Affordable Care Act.In Georgia, the state insurance commissioner, Ralph T. Hudgens, an outspoken critic of the law, often referred to as Obamacare, said the rates he approved would be up to 57.5 percent higher next year. The state had already lost Anthem, the large insurer that offers for-profit Blue Cross plans in several states, which left many markets in Georgia.Those who qualify for federal subsidies, a group that accounts for about 85 percent of the roughly 10 million people who buy insurance through the marketplaces created under the health law, will largely be shielded from the higher prices.Regulators in Florida and New York said that residents of those states who qualified for the most generous subsidies could see lower prices next year, depending on which plan they buy. In some places, the least expensive plans could become free after customers apply their subsidies. (Deficit hawks will probably complain about the higher federal outlays for subsidies.)People who earn too much to qualify for financial assistance will feel the brunt of any increases. Because many insurers raised prices most sharply on plans that are attractive to people who receive the most generous subsidies, those unable to get subsidies may have to shop for plans that are not affected or look beyond their state marketplaces for lower-priced options.The final prices and policies available for all plans may not be public until Nov. 1, leaving many consumers confused about coverage costs as a shortened period of open enrollment for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act begins.The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether it will enforce key elements of the law like the individual mandate, which encourages healthy people to sign up for insurance or be charged a tax penalty. If insurers cannot spread out the cost of coverage for people with high medical bills over a large enough group, they may be inclined to raise premiums even higher.In New Mexico, the average rate increase for plans sold on the state marketplace is about 30 percent. \u201cHalf of that increase is due to the uncertainty in Washington and the inability to lead,\u201d said John G. Franchini, the state insurance regulator. The four insurers selling policies in the state marketplace are offering more types of plans.But questions about the insurance market\u2019s future make it nearly impossible to come up with accurate projections. Regulators and actuaries said that the higher rates reflected a conservative approach as a cushion against potentially sizable losses.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for a regulator to deny those rate increases when we can take a look at their bottom line and can tell they can\u2019t continue if they can\u2019t keep their head above water,\u201d said Mike Kreidler, Washington State\u2019s insurance commissioner and a supporter of the health law.Actuaries said that the higher rates were justified. The insurers \u201care really struggling,\u201d said Kurt Giesa, a partner with Oliver Wyman, a consultant that has worked with regulators to review rates. \u201cThey have been working hard to adapt to what they are faced with right now,\u201d he said.And although they have been raising prices aggressively, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that insurers couldn\u2019t lose money,\u201d said Deep Banerjee, an industry analyst for Standard & Poor\u2019s who has been following the improved profitability of Blue Cross plans. \u201cThe trend has been improving but the market is still fragile,\u201d he said.The uncertainty over paying insurers for the so-called cost-sharing reductions, which limit out-of-pocket medical costs for people with low incomes, remains problematic. Most state regulators let insurers set prices to cover the cost of the required reductions, but several did not.The Trump administration has been paying insurers on a month-to-month basis; a legal challenge over the payments by House Republicans has left the issue in limbo.In the states that did not allow insurers to account for a loss of federal funding, the rates would be \u201cinadequate\u201d if that funding went away, said David M. Dillon, a fellow with the Society of Actuaries who has also worked with several state regulators. They \u201care just hopeful that something can be fixed later on,\u201d he said.Two insurers pulled out of the markets at the last minute because of the confusion. Medica stopped offering coverage in North Dakota next year because regulators said insurers had to assume the financing would continue; Anthem abandoned the Maine marketplace because the money had not been guaranteed.Mr. Kreidler of Washington approved two sets of rates but is only allowing insurers to charge the lower set. If the government stops paying for the subsidies, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a real challenge.\u201dIf Congress or the administration decide to keep providing the subsidies, prices will be higher than necessary if insurers raised their rates to make up for a loss of the funding. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can lower those rates with the permission\u201d of the federal agency responsible for overseeing the marketplace, Mr. Franchini of New Mexico said.Some insurers think a decision on the cost-sharing money could come too late.CareFirst, a Blue Cross insurer, offers plans in Virginia and Maryland. Virginia allowed CareFirst to assume a lack of financing; Maryland regulators prohibited insurers from setting higher rates based on a loss of subsidies.\u201cYou have this unbelievable contradiction,\u201d said Chet Burrell, CareFirst\u2019s chief executive. In Maryland, where the company is losing money on individual policies, it could sustain much deeper losses if the federal money stopped coming in.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can work it out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe workout is you will have to eat it this year.\u201dLike other insurance executives, Mr. Burrell worries that the higher prices will eventually discourage too many healthy people from enrolling. In Maryland, he said, only one-third of those buying coverage are eligible for subsidies. Everyone else pays full price. The most popular type of plan could come with premiums of $373 a month to $686 a month for a 40-year-old.\u201cGiven the size of the rate increases, we think healthier people will continue to opt out of the risk pool,\u201d he said, suggesting that would lead to rates being even higher in 2019. \u201cIf that occurs, then you\u2019re in a death spiral,\u201d he said, because as rates climb, more healthy people drop out, sending prices even higher. Mr. Burrell said he was working with regulators in Maryland to potentially create a fund that would help care for patients with the very high medical bills while possibly lowering overall premiums.But even insurers in states that have allowed for the loss of funding are not sanguine.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a stumbling in the dark next year because of all the uncertainties,\u201d Dr. Hickey of New Mexico Health Connections said. The changing circumstances and inaction by Congress have forced insurers to raise rates and experiment with different plans for those who are not eligible for federal assistance.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the beginning, again,\u201d he said.Follow Reed Abelson on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Made the Swamp Worse. Here\u2019s How to Drain It.", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsDonald Trump\u2019s pledges to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of corruption in Washington attest to his genius for unintentional irony. Nepotism, egregious conflicts of interest, flights on the public dime to see Wimbledon and the eclipse \u2014 the Beltway wetlands are now wilder and murkier than ever.It would be a mistake, though, to dismiss the swamp metaphor on account of Mr. Trump\u2019s hypocrisy. You can\u2019t make sense of his shocking victory last year without reference to the downward spiral of public faith in governing elites and established institutions. Years of stagnating incomes, combined with dimming prospects for the future, have primed voters for the message that the system is \u201crigged\u201d and that only an outsider not beholden to the corrupt establishment can clean it up.In other words, one key to this populist moment in American politics is the link in the public mind between dysfunction in Washington and the economic malaise of the 21st century. An effective political response to this perilous moment begins with the recognition that this link is real \u2014 and that key changes in the policymaking process, supported by a major push from organized philanthropy, will be needed to turn things around.The image of the swamp conveys a profound truth about the American economy. Our predicament of slow growth and sky-high inequality has many causes, but one important factor is the capture of the American political system by powerful insiders \u2014 big businesses, elite professionals, wealthy homeowners \u2014 that use it to entrench their own economic power. In so doing, they protect themselves from competition, fatten their bank accounts with diverted wealth and slow the creative destruction that drives economic growth.Four key policy areas shed light on the growth of this political-economic swamp \u2014 financial regulation, intellectual property, occupational licensing and zoning. They show that the swamp isn\u2019t confined to Washington; it can also be found in 50 state capitals and countless local jurisdictions.In the financial sector, a web of regulatory subsidies sustains financial institutions\u2019 unhealthy reliance on extremely high levels of debt. These subsidies, including policies that strongly encourage mortgage securitization as well as the implicit promise to bail out \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d institutions, swell profits in the near term while increasing the systemic risk of a catastrophic meltdown in the long run. The result is a financial sector much bigger than the economy needs, chronic misallocation of capital and the diversion of some of the country\u2019s top talent into counterproductive work. Luring people into excessive debt, draining their savings with hidden fees, inflating the next asset bubble \u2014 these and other dubious \u201ccontributions\u201d by finance to the economy need to be curtailed.Intellectual property laws are supposed to encourage innovation by granting temporary monopolies to copyright and patent holders. But if those monopolies get too broad and too onerous, innovation takes a hit \u2014 and that is precisely what has happened, at the urging and for the benefit of Hollywood, Big Pharma and some interests in Silicon Valley.Increasingly severe constraints on building in high-income coastal cities inflate the asset values of affluent homeowners, contributing significantly to rising disparities in wealth. And by making housing unaffordable, they prevent the less well-off from moving to where the good-paying jobs are, reducing geographic and social mobility.This regressive regulatory swamp isn\u2019t a natural landscape; it grows because of forces in our political environment. The beneficiaries of upward redistribution are always far more organized than those who pay the costs. They can divert some of their artificially high profits into lobbying and policy research that bestow a patina of the public interest on schemes that are, in practice, legalized robbery. Drugmakers, for example, portray even the most modest retrenchment of patent law as catastrophic for American innovation, while financiers warn that any restraint on subsidized risk-taking (through higher capital requirements, for example) will starve American industry of the capital it needs to invest and grow.This unequal battle for the minds of policymakers is particularly damaging at a time when the resources that Congress and the bureaucracy have for independent research have been systematically dismantled. In finance, in particular, Congress has a difficult time hiring and retaining staff with the technical knowledge and experience to assess the impact of new regulations, leaving them dependent on the abundant resources of the industry itself.In addition, many regressive regulations are made in obscure places with limited participation, such as state licensing boards and town councils in charge of approving new housing. Insiders with narrow interests, whether self-serving professional groups or Nimby neighbors, have the motivation and resources to show up at poorly attended meetings and work the system, often at odds with the general public\u2019s interest in low prices and economic opportunity.Really draining the swamp means changing the policymaking process to shield it against insider takeover and manipulation. For starters, congressional staffs need to be expanded, upgraded and professionalized. Legislators would then be better able to make their own assessments of complex regulatory issues without having to depend on the biased expertise of industry lobbyists.Philanthropists need to put their dollars behind a network of organizations to counter the organizational presence of the forces of upward redistribution. The Ford Foundation did this in the 1970s by investing in a network of environmental law firms like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund. More recently, the Eli and Edythe Broad, Walton Family, Robertson and other charitable foundations have made similar investments in educational reforms.Whatever you think of the merits of these causes, the new interest groups funded by sustained philanthropy changed the political landscape in these issue areas, forcing policymakers to recognize that there were, in fact, two sides to be considered. A network of new organizations with the resources and expertise to compete with big banks, the medical lobby and other industry groups could have a similar impact today. Activist groups could show up regularly in all the obscure places where rules are set and make sure that someone speaks up for the public interest.State and local governments need to institute regulatory review procedures that expose back-room deals to objective scrutiny. While cost-benefit analysis by the Office of Management and Budget is standard for new federal regulations, no such reviews are conducted when states propose to license new occupations or cities stymie new housing construction.Courts at all levels need to be less deferential to regulatory schemes that \u2014 in contrast to environmental or labor regulation \u2014 have no justification other than the protection of incumbent interests. For example, courts could force legislatures to explicitly approve expansions in the scope of occupational licensing, depriving licensing boards of the power to do so in shadowy obscurity.In the political arena, the issues of regressive regulation cut across the usual partisan and ideological battle lines, and so tend to be kept off the agenda by legislative leaders who emphasize issues that hold their caucus together. Libertarian-leaning conservatives and egalitarian liberals need to forge strange-bedfellows coalitions to tackle policies that are simultaneously bad for growth and inequality. In recent years, cross-party coalitions in the states have started to make progress on criminal justice reform. Opposition to upward redistribution can galvanize support for similar alliances on regulatory issues.The administration of Donald Trump has shown no interest in draining the real swamp that is drowning America\u2019s economy and corrupting its politics. If public-spirited Democrats and Republicans fail to do so, trust in democracy will continue to erode. And the next demagogue who cashes in by saying he alone can fix things is likely to be more disciplined and focused than Mr. Trump \u2014 and hence even more dangerous.Advertisement"}

My two opponents are right-wing Republicans who voted for Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Dietl, who has campaigned in the mode of a disruptive prankster, spit out his words with fury and animation, sometimes turning red and stabbing the air with a finger. Ms. Malliotakis, an assemblywoman from Staten Island, spoke calmly and deliberately early on, but increasingly conveyed a sense of urgency and emotion.Mr. de Blasio was mostly even-keeled, generally looking straight ahead, as if pretending he was alone on the stage \u2014 a strategy meant to make him look mayoral and allowing him to exhibit his deep command of the issues acquired through four years on the job. He emphasized falling crime numbers, affordable housing units built and the complexity of the tough issues facing the city.Ms. Malliotakis benefited from her placement at the center podium, which put her next to the mayor and allowed her to engage him directly, while Mr. Dietl, a former police detective who now runs a private investigation firm, often wound up on the fringe of their exchanges.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ms. Malliotakis said sharply to Mr. de Blasio, after he outlined steps he had taken to address the homelessness crisis. She criticized him for a program to pay rent for homeless people who leave the city to be near family or return to an area where they had previously lived.The jab seemed to get to Mr. de Blasio, who reddened and shook his head, his tongue buried in his cheek. \u201cI am very comfortable taking on the governor,\u201d he riposted.The audience was rowdy, frequently drowning out and heckling the speakers \u2014 and bringing warnings from Errol Louis, the moderator, who said that disruptive audience members would be escorted out. At least one man was removed by police officers.Mr. Dietl was also disciplined for frequently going past his allotted time and interrupting the other candidates; on at least two occasions, his microphone was turned off.Ms. Malliotakis shook her head but Mr. Dietl shouted out: \u201cFour!\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d the mayor said with a grin.During a segment in which the candidates were allowed to ask a single question of one other candidate, Mr. de Blasio went last and said that he was going to ask a question of Ms. Malliotakis, whom he called \u201cthe Assembly member\u201d throughout the night.\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Mr. Dietl protested.\u201cI could think of many questions for you, but I only get one,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, drawing laughter from the audience.Even with all the shouting and sparks, the policy differences on some topics were clear.Mr. de Blasio strongly defended his call to close the Rikers Island jail complex, in keeping with the recommendation of an advisory panel. Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Dietl said they would keep Rikers open and invest in improvements.The three were also asked about IDNYC, a city-issued identity card designed to appeal to undocumented immigrants, among others, to help them open bank accounts or access city services.But Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Dietl spent much more time criticizing Mr. de Blasio than offering ideas and plans of their own.Ms. Malliotakis said that the mayor had mismanaged city government, spending too much money on ineffective programs that had not solved problems concerning the schools, affordable housing or the homeless. \u201cI\u2019m ready to clean up his mess,\u201d she said.Mr. Dietl emphasized his business experience. \u201cI\u2019m a successful businessman,\u201d he said, adding that he \u201ccan get things done.\u201dMr. Dietl disputed the way his remarks were characterized by the questioner, Grace Rauh, of NY1. Mr. de Blasio interjected: \u201cIf you say a judge is going to make a decision based on her gender or the color of her skin, you\u2019re no better than Donald Trump.\u201dAfter the debate, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Dietl shook hands and Ms. McCray joined them. Mr. Dietl said later that he told Ms. McCray that he was sorry if his earlier remarks had offended her, and that he had not meant them as \u201ca racial epithet.\u201d He said that she shook his hand.A second and final debate will be held Nov. 1.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of a candidate for mayor.

Today, it is part of a roughly 3,000-square-foot apartment spread across three levels, with a lofted office, a massive living space with original masonry walls and its own laundry room. And it is that rare apartment that has two entrances, one of which opens onto Broadway, like a private maisonette.But what is that sound?\u201cOh, that\u2019s the N train,\u201d Mr. Hawthorne, 71, tells guests as the busy subway line rumbles underfoot.\u201cIt\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s definitely something people will notice,\u201d said Nina Horowitz Rothman, an agent with Halstead, the third agency to represent the apartment in two years.They might also notice the unusual floor plan, with two bedrooms below street level, lighted by a sidewalk light well, and the unfinished subbasement.From the lowliest studio to the grandest penthouse, nothing in Manhattan is perfect. Apartments in this fickle town have been boxed in, blown out and retrofitted by waves of new buyers, all while new buildings rose around them. In a market where 86 percent of apartments are resales, compromise is a necessity for buyers and a source of agita for sellers and their agents.But not all flaws are equal in the eyes of buyers, and savvy sellers can turn some of those quirks into positives, with the right spin \u2013 and the right price.An apartment with windows that look out onto a brick wall \u2014 or some other bleak backdrop \u2014 was the most dreaded, with an average score of 4.24 out of six. Lack of sunlight was second worst, followed by noisy streets, walk-up apartments and active construction nearby. Eccentric design was the least troublesome flaw, with a score of 2.99.Then there were the write-in responses, which read like letters from the trenches. \u201cFilth,\u201d wrote one agent, without elaborating. \u201cOffensive odors,\u201d said another. \u201cNEEDS WORK,\u201d a third shouted. More prosaic answers included high carrying costs, bad tenants and persnickety co-op boards.That\u2019s where creative marketing comes in. Patrick Lilly, an associate broker with CORE, sold a tiny one-bedroom on the Upper East Side last year that had lingered on the market for 10 months with another brokerage. It was on the second floor of a walk-up co-op on a dead-end street a long way from the subway.\u201cWe called it a cul-de-sac,\u201d Mr. Lilly said, adding that the dead-end created a quiet green space overlooking the East River that he was able to play up to make the area feel quaint and detached from the city.But when it comes to the hardest obstacles, sometimes even sleight of hand falls short, said Andrew Feldman, an associate broker with Triplemint. He had a second-floor two-bedroom apartment in the Flatiron district that faced the back, with cramped eight-foot ceilings and very poor light. \u201cIt was like a dungeon. The ceilings made it feel like a torture chamber,\u201d he said.\u201cThere was nothing about the place I could candy-coat,\u201d he continued. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t want the listing.\u201dPriced at $1.025 million, it languished on the market for 292 days. In February, after the owner had put a tenant in place, the apartment finally sold for $955,000, about 7 percent under the asking price, to an investor who was happy to collect the rental income.For truly challenged properties, it often comes down to price. In the third quarter, the median sales price of resale apartments, including condos and co-ops, rose a modest 1.9 percent, to $995,000, compared to the same period last year \u2014 a new record, according to a Douglas Elliman report. But the average listing discount also grew, to 5.5 percent, up from 2.9 percent in the same period last year. And listings took longer to sell, spending an average of 101 days on the market, up almost 28 percent from last year.\u201cThe seller is traveling further to meet the buyer,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which prepared the report. Resales are also competing with a growing share of newly built apartments, which made up 13.7 percent of inventory this quarter, up from 9.1 percent the same period last year.For sellers, facing up to that reality, especially when there is an obvious foible to their property, can mean the difference between a quick sale and listing limbo. Michael Vargas, president of Vanderbilt Appraisal in Manhattan, said the most common deficiencies could mean a 5 to 20 percent discount on resale value, compared to units without those flaws, a gap that could rise to 30 percent in a downbeat market.Still, most flaws can be mitigated with the right mix of perks. In a walk-up apartment building, the second floor typically commands the highest price, Mr. Vargas said, with each subsequent floor dropping 2 to 3 percent in price, because of the longer schlep up the stairs. The ground-floor unit is dinged because it is perceived as less private. But a high-floor unit can compensate with an emphasis on better views, a better layout and quality renovations, he said.Resisting a lower price at the outset, however, could mean headaches down the line. \u201cOnce something is on the market for a period of time, it\u2019s like sharks smelling blood in the water,\u201d said the appraiser Andrew Goodman, president of Gotham Valuation in Midtown. \u201cPeople just assume they can wait on it.\u201dAt its current listing price, the unit is about $100,000 less than comparable units with a better view, Ms. Katzen said. \u201cI was honest\u201d about the price, she said, telling the seller, who bought the apartment for about $1.3 million in 2013, that it was better to aim low and drum up interest to counter the poor views.It may have worked. The first open house, she said, had 42 showings (closer to six is typical), and she now has an offer for $100,000 over the asking price.For savvy buyers, of course, an overlooked apartment can present an opportunity. Ben Lund, 29, and his husband, Alexander Rosanelli, 27, found a one-bed, one-bath apartment with a private terrace on the Upper West Side that had lingered on the market because it was on the fourth floor of a five-story walk-up. They bought it for $475,000, down from $520,000.\u201cIt comes down to what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Mr. Rosanelli, who runs Hound\u2019s Tree Vineyards on Long Island. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really think much about the walk-up at that point. I\u2019m in a car a lot, and walking is part of what we like about the city.\u201dThe reduced sale price allowed the couple to renovate, installing custom cabinets, reclaimed oak bookshelves, new appliances and large pocket doors to the bedroom.They are now selling because Mr. Lund, who works in finance, has accepted a job in Greenwich, Conn. The listing, which came on the market in April, is at $649,000, down from an initial $675,000. Mae H. Bagai, the listing agent and an associate broker with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said that she is counting on the recent remodel and private terrace to compensate for the stairs.Often, dealing with an obstacle comes down to finding the right audience. Elizabeth Kee, an associate broker with CORE, has a railroad-style apartment in the East Village listed for $2.1 million that she is targeting at investors. The unit is on the ground floor of an artsy prewar building, where the hallways have castle-like accents and are covered in murals of Mediterranean landscapes. Its central window faces an air shaft with a brick wall.The apartment does get sunlight on either end. It also has a private rear outdoor space, but the only way to get to it is through a window with mini-steps that rise to the windowsill. Complicating the sale is the inclusion of a basement commercial space, which could make financing more challenging.\u201cIt has a little bit of everything,\u201d Ms. Kee said ruefully, but she hopes that the apartment, which has been on the market since April, will eventually appeal to a buyer looking for rental income.The key to a sale, she said, will be transparency: \u201cI would rather point something out that\u2019s a little extraordinary\u201d \u2014 the step-up window, for example \u2014 \u201crather than have them say, \u2018Wait, what is that, a hobbit door?\u2019\u201dFor Mr. Hawthorne, the NoHo homeowner, the quirks of his three-level, ground-floor apartment were never a bother. He and his wife, Dorothy Durkin Hawthorne, a former dean at the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies who died in 2011, were the first buyers of the co-op apartment, in 1978.A freelance writer and former publisher, Mr. Hawthorne said he bought the 3,000-square-foot apartment, which was raw space at the time, for $73,000 cash, an amount he happened to have on hand from a recent bonus check.Thanks to construction experience in his youth, he was able to build the apartment from the ground up with the help of a friend, creating a lofted office in the 14-foot-tall living room, two sleeping quarters on the lower level and a flexible space in the subbasement that now serves as an artist\u2019s workshop.The sound of the subway is noticeable in the basement, he admitted, but it is not intrusive. More often, it serves as the setup for a joke. \u201cI used to say, \u2018Maybe I should open up a newsstand and a coffee shop\u2019\u201d when the trains went by, he said.His agent, Ms. Rothman of Halstead, said the trouble so far has been explaining the space. \u201cPeople have no imagination, for the most part,\u201d she said, which is why she has been pitching a number of uses for the basement space: a home theater, a gym, a woodworking shop.Mr. Hawthorne, who dreams of moving to Bali with his brother-in-law and rekindling his old passion for scuba diving, said that while the layout is unusual, the apartment is now priced to allow the buyer to fully remodel the space.Just this week, they received a full-price offer from a local couple who had seen it listed at a higher price, Ms. Rothman said. And now Mr. Hawthorne has bigger concerns than train traffic.\u201cThe big challenge,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be: What will the co-op board do?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Finger-Pointing at the Finance Firm TIAA", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTIAA\u2019s clients \u2014 educators, researchers and public service workers, many inexperienced with finance \u2014 consider the company a trusted partner without whom they could not hope to retire comfortably. That many customers revere it is not an overstatement.And while TIAA contends that its operations are untainted by conflicts because its 855 financial advisers and consultants do not receive sales commissions, former employees, in interviews and in the whistle-blower complaint, disagree. They say the company rewards its sales personnel with bonuses when they steer customers into more expensive in-house products and services.Asked about the allegations, Chad Peterson, a TIAA spokesman, said the company focuses exclusively on meeting its clients\u2019 long-term financial needs and operates in \u201ca highly transparent and ethical way.\u201d He added that TIAA\u2019s clients had benefited from their association with the firm.\u201cWe\u2019ve paid more than the guaranteed payouts to our fixed annuity holders every year for more than half a century,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve paid $394 billion in benefits to retired participants since 1918. Since our founding, our retired participants have never missed a payout from us \u2014 through depressions, wars and natural disasters.\u201dAccording to interviews with 10 former employees, TIAA management assigned outsize sales quotas to its representatives and directed them to meet the quotas by playing up customers\u2019 fears of not having enough money in retirement and other \u201cpain points.\u201dThese allegations are echoed in a confidential whistle-blower complaint filed against the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission and obtained by The New York Times. The complaint, which is pending, contends that TIAA began conducting a fraudulent scheme in 2011 to convert \u201cunsuspecting retirement plan clients from low-fee, self-managed accounts to TIAA-CREF-managed accounts\u201d that were more costly. Advisers were pushed to sell proprietary mutual funds to clients as well, the complaint says. The more complex a product, the more an employee earned selling it.Those who questioned management\u2019s directives, the complaint says, were \u201cprocessed out\u201d of TIAA.Clients must also be told of conflicts. Sales representatives who do not make this clear would violate the rules.The former TIAA employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. TIAA makes employees sign an unusual agreement when they are hired stating that they will not make disparaging public comments about the company. The agreement, reviewed by The Times, gives TIAA the right to go to court to force compliance with its terms.TIAA\u2019s claims that it is more honorable than its competitors may have been true decades ago, but they no longer are, the former employees said.Edward Siedle, founder of Benchmark Financial Services, is a former S.E.C. enforcement lawyer whose firm investigates improprieties at pension funds and recently helped a whistle-blower win the largest award from the S.E.C. after an enforcement action. Mr. Siedle has been briefed on the TIAA whistle-blower complaint and the former employees who brought it. \u201cTIAA\u2019s longstanding reputation as a low-cost provider doing well for educators and not driven by profit seems to be challenged by the revelations about how it\u2019s doing business today,\u201d he said.In the early 1900s, teachers had no access to pensions that would help them live comfortably in retirement. So in 1918, the Carnegie Foundation donated $1 million to create the nonprofit Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. Its goal was to \u201censure that teachers could retire with dignity.\u201dFor decades, TIAA grew by selling mostly insurance products, like annuities that guaranteed a steady stream of retirement income to their holders. Then in 1952, TIAA added the College Retirement Equities Fund, a global stock portfolio, to its offerings. The company, still operating as a nonprofit, became known as TIAA-CREF.In most cases, clients invest with TIAA because their employers have hired it to administer their workers\u2019 retirement accounts, known as 403(b) plans. Some 15,000 of the nation\u2019s colleges, hospitals and other nonprofit organizations employ TIAA, its website says.TIAA typically acts as record-keeper to these institutions, administering accounts that allow beneficiaries to choose among an array of mutual funds and annuities. When TIAA is a plan\u2019s record keeper, its in-house funds are typically among the investments offered.The company earns a record-keeping fee from these institutions, but it can also receive far more revenues when investors buy its mutual funds and annuities. Therein lies the potential for conflict at TIAA.(I am a trustee of St. Olaf College, an institution that employs TIAA as record keeper on its retirement plans. The college recently asked other companies for information about their costs and offerings to help assess whether TIAA should stay on the job, but I will not be advising or making decisions on that matter.)Still, TIAA\u2019s management said, the change would allow it to pursue investment opportunities it had not been able to engage in as a tax-exempt entity.Former employees said the company became more aggressive in its sales practices when Herbert M. Allison Jr., a longtime Merrill Lynch executive, took over as TIAA\u2019s chief executive in 2002. Around that time, the company was facing a major problem: Many clients withdrew their money when they retired from their universities or hospitals, moving their accounts to competitors like Vanguard, Charles Schwab and even higher-end brokerages like Merrill Lynch.Eager to stanch the outflows, TIAA set up a registered investment advisory firm in 2004 that began offering private asset management services. In 2005, it created the Wealth Management Group, providing managed accounts for clients, for a fee.The costs of these accounts were high compared with TIAA\u2019s basic retirement accounts, and so was the pressure to sell them, according to the whistle-blower complaint. It notes that TIAA levied fees of 0.75 percent to 1.15 percent of assets under management. These charges came on top of the often hefty costs associated with TIAA funds or annuities.\u201cHad the retirement plan clients known of the advisers\u2019 conflict of interest, they certainly would have been more wary and undertaken more investigation to discover the managed accounts the advisers were pushing were subject to substantially higher fees,\u201d the complaint says.Former employees contend that sales pressures at TIAA increased after it began losing university and other institutional accounts to competitors. Internally, TIAA executives had a name for this problem: Money in Motion. And in the fall of 2014, TIAA was reeling from the loss of the $1.3 billion University of Notre Dame account.Losing such an account not only means no more record-keeping fees for TIAA, it also means the company will no longer generate money management revenues from participants\u2019 purchases of in-house funds. That\u2019s because TIAA\u2019s funds are rarely offered to participants in plans that do not employ the company as record keeper.After Notre Dame decided to move to Fidelity, a group of TIAA executives convened a conference call. Topic A: how to stop other accounts from walking out the door.According to a tape provided by a former employee, one executive reported that the company had lost almost $6.4 billion in assets to competitors so far that year. When clients stopped taking part in a plan by retiring or changing jobs, the executive said, only half kept their money there.Changing this dynamic was crucial, the executives agreed. And one urged the group to look at who was at risk of moving money out of TIAA accounts \u201cand target those participants.\u201dIn recent years, lawsuits directed at high-cost providers of retirement account services have shed light on the expenses associated with these arrangements. TIAA\u2019s offerings have been among those drawing scrutiny.In 2015, TIAA came under attack in a lawsuit brought by its own employees. This past May, TIAA agreed to pay $5 million to settle the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the company breached its fiduciary duty by overcharging its workers in their retirement plan.The plan offered only high-cost TIAA investment products, the lawsuit said. TIAA strongly denied the allegations but agreed to include investment options from outside fund managers in a settlement of the case; TIAA said it settled to avoid the costs and distractions of litigation.According to Morningstar, the average asset-weighted expense ratio on TIAA\u2019s mutual funds was 0.32 percent in 2016. Although lower than the 0.57 percent mutual fund industry average, it is more expensive than a low-cost provider like Vanguard, whose average expense ratio was 0.11 percent in 2016.TIAA denied liability in this case, saying the processing delays arose from a system upgrade.Last February, a new lawsuit was brought by Melissa Haley, a participant in the Washington University Retirement Savings Plan. She alleged that TIAA had improperly charged her for loans she took out using her retirement account as collateral.When a participant borrows against retirement-plan assets, most plan overseers take the loan out of the participant\u2019s account. That way, the interest paid on the loan goes back to the borrower.Ms. Haley, who works as an administrator in cancer research at Washington University\u2019s School of Medicine, said in an interview that she had been surprised when she learned about TIAA\u2019s loan practices. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to do good things at the university, and you assume that anyone who is affiliated with it would be on the same path,\u201d she said. \u201cTIAA doesn\u2019t have the values I thought it did.\u201dMr. Peterson of TIAA said the company denies Ms. Haley\u2019s allegations and will fight her suit vigorously. After the lawsuit was filed, TIAA told some college officials that loans should be funded from a participant\u2019s account, calling that approach \u201ca best practice.\u201dEven though TIAA stopped being a nonprofit organization in 1997, many of its customers might think it remains one. The company\u2019s website ends in a .org rather than a .com and TIAA repeatedly refers to its \u201cnonprofit heritage.\u201dAccording to TIAA\u2019s 2016 annual statement, it generated $30.8 billion in income; $15 billion of that came from premiums collected on its insurance products. It earned almost $12 billion in investment income for its clients and $221 million in fees associated with TIAA\u2019s investment management, administration and investment contract guarantees.As these figures show, insurance is by far TIAA\u2019s biggest business. It is a stock life insurance company whose shares are held by TIAA\u2019s board of overseers. Most of the money it generates in its businesses is reinvested in the company or paid out to holders of TIAA annuities, the company says. Last year, it paid $3.8 billion to those holders.TIAA\u2019s employees were paid almost $1 billion in 2016, its filings show.TIAA\u2019s financial consultants who deal with institutions also receive bonuses based on their success in keeping clients\u2019 money in house, the filing shows.But the whistle-blower complaint recounted a comment made by an executive at a convention of the company\u2019s advisers in Orlando, Fla., in 2014. At the event, the complaint said, Carol Deckbar, then executive vice president and chief operating officer at the company, urged advisers to put more of their clients into in-house mutual funds. \u201cWhere do you think you get your bonuses?\u201d the executive asked the crowd, according to the complaint.Ms. Deckbar, now head of institutional investment and endowment products and services at TIAA, declined to comment through the TIAA spokesman. The spokesman also declined to comment.To receive a bonus, the former employees said, they had to meet a series of production thresholds and qualitative measures. Advisers work against a performance scorecard each year.This creates an incentive, former employees said, for sales representatives to push retiring professors or administrators to move money from their institutional plan, with annual costs of around 0.3 percent of assets under management, to managed accounts charging fees of 0.7 percent to 1 percent.Mr. Peterson, the TIAA spokesman, declined to comment about these allegations. An S.E.C. filing by TIAA said that it has a transaction review process aimed at making sure that recommendations are appropriate for clients.The employee scorecard represented both carrot and stick. If enough money was not being rolled into managed accounts, representatives\u2019 bonuses could be cut at their supervisor\u2019s discretion, a former sales representative said.A new federal fiduciary rule, which will require financial advisers working on retirement accounts to put their clients\u2019 interests first, states that firms like TIAA cannot use bonuses or other incentives that would \u201ccause advisers to make recommendations that are not in the best interest of the retirement investor.\u201d Along with many on Wall Street, TIAA argued against the fiduciary rule.But in June, the company changed the message it wanted its sales representatives to tell clients. A training update to wealth management advisers, provided to The Times from a current employee, came as the new fiduciary rule was being finalized.It told advisers \u201cto avoid accidentally implying that you may be acting as a fiduciary,\u201d when having educational conversations with clients. They should avoid \u201creferencing the participant\u2019s best interest\u201d and \u201cdiscussions regarding TIAA\u2019s not-for-profit heritage.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association referred incorrectly to the method some former employees used to make whistleblower accusations against the company. It was a complaint filed with regulators, not a lawsuit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seven Flights for $800,000: Mnuchin\u2019s Travel on Military Jets", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has flown on military aircraft seven times since March at a cost of more than $800,000, including a $15,000 round-trip flight to New York to meet with President Trump at Trump Tower, according to the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General.The inquiry into Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s air travel, prompted by an Instagram posting by his wife, found he broke no laws in his use of military aircraft but lamented the loose justification provided for such costly flights.\u201cWhat is of concern is a disconnect between the standard of proof called for\u201d by the Office of Management and Budget \u201cand the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests,\u201d the inspector general wrote.Mr. Mnuchin has made nine requests for military aircraft since assuming his position earlier this year and has taken seven flights. A request to use a military plane for his European honeymoon with his wife, Louise Linton, in August was withdrawn. A ninth flight is scheduled for later this month, when Mr. Mnuchin is expected to travel to the Middle East.The investigation follows a series of controversies over the lavish travel of several members of President Trump\u2019s cabinet, including Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, who resigned last week after racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights.The Treasury report found no instances in which Mr. Mnuchin used military aircraft for private travel.\u201cGreat #day trip to #Kentucky!\u201d Ms. Linton wrote under the photograph. She then added hashtags for various pieces of her expensive wardrobe, listing #rolandmouret, #hermesscarf, #tomford and #valentino. The photo prompted outrage on social media and led to speculation that Mr. Mnuchin had timed the trip and requested the plane so that he could have an optimal view of the solar eclipse, which was occurring that day.The report found that \u201cthere is no indication that the date was chosen to coincide with the solar eclipse.\u201d It said that Mr. Mnuchin had asked for a Gulfstream 550 military jet in case the runway at Fort Knox was wet and because a plane with \u201ccommunications capabilities is requested in the event that the secretary\u2019s participation on a call during travel arises.\u201d The flight cost $26,900.25.Treasury secretaries generally take commercial flights except in extenuating circumstances because of the exorbitant costs of using military planes.For instance, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s June flight to Miami for a meeting with the Mexican finance minister cost $43,725.50. While the flight was approved, the Treasury Department\u2019s travel office sent a note to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s assistant that a round-trip commercial flight would cost just $688.An Aug. 15 trip on a Gulfstream V that Mr. Mnuchin took to see Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in New York to discuss tax reform and tariffs cost $15,112.50. According to an internal email cited by the inspector general, Mr. Mnuchin needed to use the plane so that he could conduct a classified telephone conversation with Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state.Amtrak tickets between New York and Washington can often be had for under $100 each way, though private conversations can and are often overheard.The inspector general noted that a memo from the Office of Management and Budget issued last week called for more \u201crigor\u201d in justifying government aircraft requests and expressed concern about the \u201cboilerplate\u201d justifications that the Treasury Department offered.Democrats assailed Mr. Mnuchin and the Trump administration for wasting taxpayer dollars.\u201cIt\u2019s clear now that this scandal didn\u2019t start or end with former H.H.S. Secretary Tom Price,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Trump administration to come clean with the American people and show us what other top officials in this administration have been using the White House as a luxury travel agency.\u201dFor its part, the Treasury Department took solace in the fact that no violations were found and emphasized Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s need for secure communications.\u201cWe appreciate the inspector general\u2019s thorough review of Treasury\u2019s travel requests, which identified no violation of law, regulation or ethics requirements in connection with the department\u2019s requests,\u201d a Treasury Department spokeswoman said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Said to Order Luxembourg to Collect Back Taxes From Amazon", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials will order Luxembourg to collect back taxes from the online retail giant Amazon, a source with knowledge of the decision said Tuesday, the latest in a series of moves where Brussels has sought to flex its regulatory muscle over Silicon Valley.It was not clear how much Luxembourg would be ordered to reclaim, according to the source, who did not want to be identified discussing information that was not yet public. Officials in Luxembourg and the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, declined to comment.The actions have highlighted the heightened scrutiny faced by low-tax nations in the European Union. Those countries, critics argue, help multinationals funnel revenues from larger markets in order to lower their overall tax bill. Such behavior has infuriated larger countries like France, whose budgets have been squeezed in recent years.At the time, the commission said that, in a deal struck in 2003, authorities in Luxembourg had conferred \u201can advantage on Amazon.\u201d The commission added that the \u201cadvantage is obtained every year and ongoing,\u201d and that it \u201cis also granted in a selective manner.\u201dAmazon does business across the 28-nation bloc, but lists its European headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000. The agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg effectively capped the amount of tax Amazon paid, and relied on a method called transfer pricing, according to the commission.Transfer pricing has long been used by multinational companies to assign profits to different units, depending on factors like their role in the overall business and assets. But, according to the commission, these rules are harder to apply for technology companies, because their assets, like intellectual property, are intangible.European regulators have claimed that Amazon sent most of its European revenue from one unit in Luxembourg to a separate subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax in the country. As a result, it was able to reduce the profit it generated from its European operations and cut its tax bill, the commission said.It is not illegal in the European Union for countries to try to lure businesses with low tax rates. But offering special deals to companies that are not available to their competitors can amount to what is known as illegal state aid.Both Amazon and Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry have previously denied that the online retail giant received special tax treatment or benefits.Amazon has already been in the commission\u2019s cross hairs this year for unfair competition.Efforts to curb multinationals from dodging tax have risen in prominence in recent months.Last month, the European Union began considering new proposals broadly aimed at tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.The prominence of Luxembourg has put Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in an awkward position: his role includes oversight of the investigations yet his critics accuse him of having helped turn Luxembourg into a tax haven during his nearly two decades leading that country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Benefits (and the Catch) of Health Savings Accounts", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserIt\u2019s benefits open enrollment season at many employers, and workers are increasingly likely to hear about an option, known as an H.S.A., that can help them pay for medical expenses and save money on their taxes.H.S.A.s, or health savings accounts, are not yet as familiar as their better-known cousin, the F.S.A., flexible spending account. But H.S.A.s are becoming more common, according to the latest data.H.S.A.s offer a triple tax benefit. Contributions can be deducted pretax from your paycheck, lowering your taxable income; any interest or investment gains on the money is tax free; and withdrawals from the account are tax free, as long you spend the money on eligible items.And if you change jobs, the H.S.A. moves with you.But there\u2019s a catch: The savings accounts are available only with certain health insurance plans meeting specific criteria, like high deductibles \u2014 at least $1,300 for an individual and $2,600 for a family. (A deductible is the amount you pay for care before your health plan pays.)High-deductible health plans typically have cheaper monthly premiums \u2014 but you\u2019ll pay more out of pocket for care. The H.S.A. is meant to help cover those costs.You can set aside as much as $3,400 for an individual, or $6,750 for a family, in an H.S.A. You can leave the money in a basic, interest-bearing savings account or, in some cases, invest the money \u2014 just as you would with a 401(k) retirement account \u2014 for the long term.Ryan McCostlin, an expert in individual and family health care at the advisory firm Bernard Health, said the tax-free growth available with H.S.A.s made them powerful savings tools. \u201cConsumers should put that money in the market and let it grow slowly over time,\u201d Mr. McCostlin said in an email.Fidelity, which offers H.S.A.s, said money invested in a health savings account could help provide cash to cover needed health and medical costs in retirement. It estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring this year will need $275,000 to cover health and medical costs throughout retirement. (The cost estimate assumes enrollment in Medicare coverage but does not include extra costs like a nursing home or long-term care.)Many H.S.A.s, however, require that you have a minimum amount saved \u2014 say, $1,000 \u2014 before you can invest. The idea is that you should have some money set aside before you take investment risks.\u201cIf you will need the funds in the near future to pay medical bills, it may not make sense to invest,\u201d said Roy Ramthun, an H.S.A. consultant.But some account providers let you invest at any time. The health finance start-up Lively, for instance, allows H.S.A. participants to invest with no minimum balance. Lively offers a basic H.S.A. free, or charges users a flat $2.50 a month to invest in low-cost mutual funds and exchange-traded funds through the online brokerage firm TD Ameritrade.(Basketball fans may be interested to know that one of Lively\u2019s financial backers is the N.B.A. star Kevin Durant, who said in a prepared statement that he was \u201cdrawn to tech that helps people in real ways.\u201d)Here are some questions and answers about health savings accounts:Do I have to spend the money in my H.S.A. by a certain date?No. There\u2019s no deadline for spending the money in an H.S.A.; the balance simply rolls over year to year. (The Employee Benefit Research Institute said more than 90 percent of H.S.A.s ended 2016 with funds to roll over for future expenses).What can I buy using my H.S.A.?Can I have an H.S.A. if I\u2019m self-employed?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rich, the Powerful and the Manhattan D.A.", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialCyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, was asked a few days ago if he deemed it appropriate for a prosecutor to take campaign money, as he does, from lawyers who have dealings with his office. Mr. Vance said, \u201cThe answer is that it\u2019s legal.\u201dThat was the B response. The A answer \u2014 and he knew it \u2014 would have been to acknowledge that eyebrows understandably soar skyward when a district attorney pockets cash from a lawyer who may have a client facing charges that could send that client to Attica.Mr. Vance then said he\u2019d review his fund-raising policies. It was a welcome acknowledgment that what is legal is not necessarily what is proper. \u201cThe last few weeks have been an opportunity for me to think anew,\u201d he said.The last few weeks have not been the best for Mr. Vance, who has no opposition on the Nov. 7 ballot as he seeks election to a third four-year term.In both situations Mr. Vance had at one point or another accepted campaign contributions from those people\u2019s lawyers. In the Trump case he returned the money when questions about it arose, but the issue of whether there had been a quid pro quo lingered. Some critics accused the district attorney of taking a dive for the rich and powerful in matters that would have had people of lesser influence slapped in handcuffs.Nonsense, Mr. Vance said. Those cases, he said, were dropped solely because lawyers on his staff had concluded that they were not sustainable. The notion that he would end a case for money was \u201cludicrous,\u201d he said.Perhaps his record of honorable service gives him claim to the benefit of the doubt. But as Mr. Vance belatedly realized, appearances matter, especially for those whose positions give them power to decide other people\u2019s fates. That\u2019s where money not only talks, it shouts.In a statement submitted to state elections officials on Wednesday, Mr. Vance reported $925,333.49 in his campaign account. The list of donors is strewn with law firms and individual lawyers. To some extent that\u2019s understandable. They have a special interest, as professionals, in seeing that solid people are elected district attorney.But some of them may have unsavory motives when they open their wallets. So it\u2019s good to hear Mr. Vance now say he will ask an unspecified \u201coutside group\u201d to explore remedies going forward.He mentioned possible changes, like a cap on permissible gifts to his campaigns and tighter restrictions on contributions from lawyers dealing with his staff. He was speaking only for his own office. But given its prominence, whatever he decides is sure to be noted, even followed, by district attorneys elsewhere in the state.Maybe a flat-out ban on donations from lawyers ought to at least be considered as well. You never know who among them will plead someday for prosecutorial leniency for a client.Again, appearances matter. As lawyers might say, res ipsa loquitur. The thing speaks for itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iraq Will Remain United", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOur people have made extraordinary sacrifices to liberate their land. Daesh thought it could exploit the vulnerability of the Iraqi state, but it underestimated the overwhelming desire of the Iraqi people for unity.Worst of all, the referendum emboldens the remnants of Daesh. No effort for autonomy or self-rule can succeed if it is approached illegally. Unilateral actions violating the law threaten the stability of our entire country, and therefore our neighbors, as well.As prime minister of Iraq, I am required to act in accordance with the Constitution to protect all of the Iraqi people and to keep our country united. To do so, the government has reinforced and restored what is prescribed in its federal mandate: that is, federal authority over national borders, oil exports and customs revenues.I have instructed these forces to not provoke skirmishes or conflict. But they have a duty to protect citizens and defend themselves if they come under fire. Our orders to the armed forces are to secure federal facilities in Kirkuk and other northern areas, assist with the safe return of displaced people, and maintain vigilance against terrorist attacks. We have instructed local officials to ensure all public services operate as normal and improve service provision where possible.Maintaining security will also entail ensuring economic stability. After years of conducting unconstitutional oil sales and pocketing the revenue, the Kurdistan Regional Government is on the verge of bankruptcy. This is a result of the corruption of a few Kurdish officials and their families. My government intends to redress the inequitable distribution of our national resources to discourage corruption in the Kurdish region, and protect the people there and in the whole of Iraq.Just as Iraq united to defeat Daesh over the past three years, we now need to apply that same unity to our next challenges: reconstruction and building a democratic country where each citizen enjoys full access to the protection of the state.I was elected prime minister in 2014 under incredibly difficult circumstances: A third of the country was overrun by terrorists, the economy was struggling, people were divided by sectarianism and relations with the wider world were strained. We have made great strides. In addition to defeating Daesh, we expect to achieve real gross domestic product growth of 2.9 percent in 2018. This year we were able to issue two international financing bonds. But restoring services to cities and rebuilding communities is not something Iraq can achieve on its own. We will need investment and financing to ensure that we not only recover, but prosper.For the sake of all Iraqi citizens, we cannot allow the seeds of discord to take root again. I urge the leadership in Iraqi Kurdistan to come to its senses. Iraq cannot and will not recognize unilateral, unconstitutional actions taken by a few against the will of the nation. Personal profiteering must be put aside to ensure national prosperity. On behalf of the people of Iraq, I call on the Kurdish Regional Government to acknowledge the authority of the Constitution and to enter dialogue on this basis.The federal government of Iraq seeks continued support and cooperation from our international partners. For now, we urge regional powers and other outsiders not to interfere in our affairs. Iraq must be able to demonstrate its coming of age by using democratic structures to solve internal disputes. In the medium term, the international community can transition their support from security-based to economic-based. Initiatives that build trusted, efficient and democratic forms of local governance across Iraq, including the Kurdish region, are crucial. The fair distribution of resources must form the bedrock of our approach.Achieving this as one Iraq, with a united vision of our place in the world, is best for our stability. And a stable Iraq is what is best for the stability of the region and the world.Haider al-Abadi is the prime minister of Iraq.Advertisement"}

Clerics led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the monarch that year and established an Islamic republic. His successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is currently the supreme leader of Iran.Mr. Trump then listed the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, Iran\u2019s sponsorship of terrorism and its support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria among other examples of the country\u2019s \u201chostile actions.\u201dAll of these actions are undoubtedly hostile, but they require more context, said Abbas Amanat, an Iran scholar at Yale University, who added that the 1979 revolution was a popular movement and that the government, though repressive, has been moderating.\u201cAny attempt to renege or decertify or impose sanctions again has a tremendously negative impact on the current moderates in Iran\u201d who support Mr. Rouhani and, in turn, would fuel hard-liners, Mr. Amanat said.Mr. Trump misled about the deal\u2019s \u201cimmediate financial boost\u201d to Iran. Before the 1979 revolution, Iran\u2019s shah had paid $400 million for American military goods but, after he was overthrown, they were never delivered. The clerics who seized control demanded the money back, but the United States refused. The additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35 years. An initial reimbursement was released after the Iran deal was implemented and to help secure the release of American hostages.Mr. Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that \u201cthe regime intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for.\u201dThe White House did not respond when asked to identify an instance of intimidation. But the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the watchdog group tasked with inspection, has yet to report issues with access.\u201cTo my knowledge, there is no evidence of this. The I.A.E.A. has never said that this is the case,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a former sanctions coordinator at the State Department and a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Yukiya Amano, the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s director general, repeatedly stated in a September news briefing that Iran was following the rules. He did not mention any instances of intimidation.\u201cSo far, the I.A.E.A. has had access to all locations it needed to visit,\u201d he said. \u201cAt present, Iran is subject to the world\u2019s most robust nuclear verification regime.\u201dMr. Trump exaggerated when he suggested the deal\u2019s \u201csunset clauses\u201d are imminent.Inspectors are to monitor centrifuges and related infrastructure for 15 years, verify inventory for 20 years and monitor uranium mines for 25 years.Advertisement"}

That could help Mr. Odinga and his party, said Nic Cheeseman, a professor and expert on African democracy at the University of Birmingham in Britain.\u201cThat way, they get another 60 days to build up their steam,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey get more campaign financing, and proper electoral reforms are made.\u201dFor the election to take place, Mr. Cheeseman added, \u201ccritical compromise\u201d was needed.\u201cWe simply haven\u2019t seen genuine progress on negotiations on how to go forward,\u201d he said.Analysts have suggested that Mr. Odinga, who is running low on campaign money, is withdrawing from the race for tactical reasons. They speculate that he may not have enough support to win the vote under current conditions and is bowing out to save face.That may allow him to maintain his legacy as a veteran fighter for democratic reforms and for having instigated the Supreme Court\u2019s historic ruling.When announcing his withdrawal from the race, Mr. Odinga said it was best for him to pull out, \u201cconsidering the interests of the people of Kenya, the region and the world at large.\u201dIn its ruling, the court singled out the election board for mishandling the original vote. But the same officials are expected to oversee the new vote \u2014 an arrangement that Mr. Odinga strongly opposes. Before withdrawing from the race on Tuesday, he repeatedly threatened to boycott the vote if they were not replaced and prosecuted.Mr. Kenyatta has called the Supreme Court judges \u201cthugs\u201d and vowed to \u201cfix\u201d the judiciary. His Jubilee Party recently introduced amendments to electoral laws that have been widely criticized as efforts to clip the judiciary\u2019s wings.One amendment would ban the Supreme Court from nullifying a presidential election unless violations of the Constitution or electoral law significantly altered the outcome.During a campaign tour on Monday, Mr. Kenyatta said his rival was free to withdraw from the race \u201cif he\u2019s not interested.\u201d Kenyans \u201care tired,\u201d Mr. Kenyatta said. \u201cIf he does not want elections, he should keep off and let the country move forward.\u201dMr. Kenyatta responded to Mr. Odinga\u2019s announcement on Tuesday by saying that his opponent had exercised his \u201cdemocratic right\u201d to pull out of the race. But he also described his rival\u2019s withdrawal as \u201cinjustice,\u201d saying billions of dollars had already been spent to prepare for the repeat election. \u201cThat money would have been used to build roads,\u201d Mr. Kenyatta said.Patrick Gathara, a Kenyan commentator and a political cartoonist based in Nairobi, called the new developments \u201cthe best moment for Kenya\u2019s civic education.\u201d\u201cPeople are talking and quoting the Constitution in bars; people are paying attention,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a crisis, but we\u2019re clarifying the rules and the laws. We\u2019re going into places that make us uncomfortable.\u201dStill, the uncertainty surrounding the election is increasing frustration among Kenyans and affecting the economy, with far fewer tourists and business deals being made.\u201cPeople are getting fed up of politics,\u201d said Wilson Riungu, a cabdriver in Nairobi. \u201cThe economy is getting worse day by day. It\u2019s always politics, politics, politics.\u201d He voted for Mr. Kenyatta in August but is now unsure if he will even go to the polls on Election Day, let alone whom he will cast his ballot for.Western diplomats, who had praised the initial vote, have now condemned Kenya\u2019s political leaders for preventing a smooth and peaceful election.\u201cIf the upcoming election devolves into chaos, the economy, businesses, jobholders and families \u2014 all Kenyans \u2014 will pay a heavy price,\u201d read a statement from a group of diplomats representing the United States, Britain and the European Union.The statement criticized Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s proposed amendments but also Mr. Odinga for his demands, saying they undermined the electoral body\u2019s mandate to hold the new vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A White House Story Reveals Shifting Stance on Tax Cuts for the Rich", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe story, told at the White House press briefing, was meant to illustrate the realities of America\u2019s progressive tax system. Instead, Ms. Sanders\u2019 tale appears to conflict with another story that President Trump likes to tell: the one about how he\u2019s not interested in cutting taxes for the rich.Earlier this month, in a meeting with members of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Trump repeated his oft-told anecdote of a chat he had with his good friend Robert Kraft, the wealthy owner of the New England Patriots, in which Mr. Kraft implored him to cut taxes for the middle class but not the rich. Mr. Trump agreed with that notion, Democrats who attended the meeting said, and declared that his coming tax bill would be focused on the middle class and not on rich people like Mr. Trump.On Monday, though, Ms. Sanders opened her press briefing with a story that, at its core, is a defense of cutting taxes on high earners because they pay a greater share of taxes than those on the lower end of the income scale.The reporters correspond to taxpayers across the American income distribution, and their division of the night\u2019s tab, in Ms. Sanders\u2019 telling, corresponds to the breakdown in who pays income taxes in the United States. The poorest reporters pay no tab at all. The middle pay a little. The richest foot most of the bill.\u201cThe 10 reporters drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, in a metaphorical break from the administration\u2019s case that Americans are dissatisfied with the current tax code, \u201cuntil one day, the bar owner threw them a curveball. \u2018Since you\u2019re all such good customers,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20.\u2019 Drinks for the 10 reporters would now cost just $80.\u201dLong story short, the \u201cfair\u201d way, in the story, to apportion that $20 discount would be to give most of it to the richest reporters, who were paying the most for drinks in the first place. That, in turn, would make the poorest reporters angry that they saved less than the richest ones.\u201cThe nine reporters yelled at the tenth and made him feel bad,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cSo the next night the tenth man didn\u2019t show up for drinks, and the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They no longer had enough money between them all to even cover half of the bill.\u201dShe concluded: \u201cAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is how our tax system works. The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally benefit from a tax reduction, but not the largest percent benefit. Taxing them too much \u2014 attack them \u2014 and they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.\u201dNever mind that Ms. Sanders seems to be making the case that rich Americans \u2014 these are personal taxes we are talking about, after all \u2014 might flee the country if the middle class gets a tax cut and they don\u2019t. The point here is that the Trump administration is shifting away from the president\u2019s own words. They\u2019re not saying the rich shouldn\u2019t get any tax relief \u2014 they\u2019re saying the rich deserve to get one.Mr. Trump famously does not drink. But that rhetorical shift might draw a toast from supply side conservatives, who have long argued that cuts at the top end are both deserved and necessary for economic growth, and some bottle smashing from Democrats, who have long criticized the president for saying one thing on taxes and proposing plans that do something quite different.Advertisement"}

An Election Won\u2019t Change That.", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOBIHIRO, Japan \u2014 Standing before an audience of mostly men here on Japan\u2019s northern island, a parliamentary candidate in Sunday\u2019s elections made a pointed appeal.\u201cI am 33 years old, and I have two children,\u201d Kaori Ishikawa said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t such a woman be elected?\u201dIt seemed as if this election could change some of that. It won\u2019t.But two weeks ago, Ms. Koike decided not to run. And even in her own party, only one-fifth of the candidates are women.Fewer than one in five of the 1,180 candidates running in this Sunday\u2019s election for the lower house of parliament are women \u2014 and that is a record high for Japan. Among candidates for the governing Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has repeatedly said he wants to create a society where women can \u201cshine,\u201d fewer than one in 12 are women.What\u2019s more, the number of women standing as candidates for the governing party is down by about 40 percent since three years ago.The barriers for women entering political life in Japan are many. Entrenched political machines often favor longstanding relationships with men. And women face scrutiny from the news media and the public that focuses on personalities and looks rather than political accomplishments.In this election, the news media has pounded several female candidates for extramarital affairs, including a woman whose husband was the one who cheated. This week\u2019s issue of Shukan Bunshun, a popular tabloid magazine, features an article about three female parliamentary candidates with the headline, \u201cCan the \u2018Affair Disaster\u2019 Girls Make It?\u201dPolitical experts say it is difficult to find enough women to run for office even though women are as educated as men and female participation in the work force is relatively high. Those with leadership potential may not want to leave workplaces where they fought so hard to advance.\u201cIt is not that easy to bring serious women to the political arena,\u201d said Mieko Nakabayashi, a professor of political science at Waseda University in Tokyo.Kathy Matsui, chief Japan equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo who has advised Mr. Abe on women\u2019s issues, said political parties needed to groom female candidates. \u201cYou do need somebody who is really going to build that consensus at the top and say, \u2018Look, this is just not right,\u2019\u201d Ms. Matsui said. \u201cIf the society is 50-50, then we need to represent everybody\u2019s interests.\u201dSome women say they would rather put their energy into changing the Japanese work culture to allow employees more flexible hours and to structure jobs around projects rather than time sheets, steps that could be helpful to women, especially mothers.Here in the 11th District of Hokkaido, a 4,200-square-mile region of farmland that prides itself on its pork, dairy products and coastal seafood, the two leading candidates are women, making it a rare exception to the gender imbalance.Ms. Ishikawa, a former television announcer, is representing the Constitutional Democratic Party, a left-leaning party formed this month. Her chief rival is another woman, Yuko Nakagawa, the incumbent from the right-leaning Liberal Democrats. The two are running neck-and-neck, according to local polls.The challenges to women trying to make their way in the public sphere in Japan were readily apparent on the campaign trail. Both candidates followed their husbands into politics, a point frequently emphasized by supporters and critics alike.Ms. Ishikawa is the wife of Tomohiro Ishikawa, a former legislator who was indicted on charges of violating political finance laws and is prohibited from running for office. News reports have characterized her as merely taking his place.\u201cI am not a substitute,\u201d she declared on Thursday evening at a local agricultural association. \u201cMy seriousness has been tested in this election, but I am asking you to help me win.\u201dMs. Nakagawa, 58, is the widow of Shoichi Nakagawa, a renowned national lawmaker and close ally of Mr. Abe whose father was also a member of parliament. Although she has served five years in the Diet, as Japan\u2019s parliament is known, party officials say her last name carries more weight than her experience.On Friday morning, Ms. Nakagawa appeared at a meeting at the party\u2019s headquarters in Obihiro, the largest city in the district. In a large cement-floored room where a Shinto altar dedicated to her husband loomed behind her, she bowed and thanked a group of all-male party and business leaders for their support.Toru Otsuka, a conservative member of the Obihiro City Council, acknowledged that Ms. Nakagawa had \u201cmade an effort\u201d during her time in office. But, he said, \u201cthe local people in this area like her husband\u2019s legacy.\u201d\u201cIf a dog bites a man it does not make news, but if a man bites a dog it is news,\u201d Mr. Otsuka said. \u201cIt is still a rare case for women to run, so that is why people are paying attention to this women\u2019s boom.\u201dMs. Nakagawa has emphasized her role in the government response to a series of damaging typhoons last year, though tabloids have dredged up her affair with a married legislator nearly three years ago. During a debate in Obihiro, the moderator referred to the affair.\u201cI do think women are more likely to be asked those kinds of questions,\u201d Ms. Nakagawa said.Ms. Nakagawa herself seemed to invoke gender stereotypes when she quipped in a campaign speech that she was having a tough time competing with Ms. Ishikawa because she is \u201cbeautiful and young,\u201d a comment that was picked up by a national television news program.Ms. Nakagawa said she was trying to make a joke. \u201cBefore talking about my policies, I wanted to get people to relax,\u201d she said. \u201cThe media was being mean by just picking up that comment.\u201dDuring the campaign, Mr. Abe has pledged to increase spending on child care and education, but has not addressed the low number of women running on his ticket. The secretary-general of the party, Toshihiro Nikai, told reporters that gender should not be a factor.\u201cIt\u2019s better to decide on candidates naturally,\u201d he said, \u201cnot because they are male or female.\u201dWomen\u2019s advocates say the government must go beyond rhetoric to improve gender equality in politics.This year, a bipartisan committee in the lower house introduced a bill to encourage parties to set targets for the proportion of female candidates. Mr. Abe dissolved the lower chamber before the bill came up for a vote.Ryoko Akamatsu, president of Women in New World, International Network, a women\u2019s advocacy group that backed the measure, said quotas had worked in other countries, like France. \u201cThey were serious,\u201d Ms. Akamatsu said.Some women say that having more female lawmakers won\u2019t matter. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure whether having so many women there makes that much of a difference,\u201d said Yoko Ishikura, professor emeritus of international corporate strategy at Hitotsubashi University.But at a campaign stop at a strip mall in Obihiro on Friday, Yoko Tazaki, a 44-year-old part-time nurse and mother of a 10-year-old son, came to cheer on Ms. Ishikawa.\u201cI want to support a person like Kaori who is raising children right now,\u201d Ms. Tazaki said, explaining that she had been forced to leave a full-time job when her son was born and had found it difficult to re-enter the work force. \u201cI think Kaori can change that situation,\u201d Ms. Tazaki said.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Obihiro.

Democrats who attended, including many whose states Mr. Trump won, said the president agreed with every point raised on the subject of tax cuts for the middle class. At the end of the meeting, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon told Mr. Trump that the tax bill Republicans were drafting would not deliver on his promises to the middle class and would instead benefit corporations and high earners.Mr. Trump looked at his top economic advisers, waved his hand, and said, \u201cTake care of it,\u201d Mr. Wyden recalled in an interview.Democrats have little expectation that Republican lawmakers will take heed when House lawmakers introduce their tax bill next week. And Mr. Wyden and other Democrats are not waiting: They are already attacking the legislation as a bait-and-switch in the hopes that they can find a path forward to a bipartisan tax bill that they believe will truly benefit middle-class Americans.\u201cThis is a middle-class con job,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Democrats hope that by killing the Republican bill, they can work with Mr. Trump to create bipartisan legislation that achieves a middle-class tax cut.\u201cThere are areas where we can come together,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, \u201cbut there\u2019s no way we can come together on raising taxes on the middle class. That\u2019s the Achilles\u2019 heel of their bill.\u201dRepublicans are putting the middle class at the forefront of the discussion of their plan to pass the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in a generation.

Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe entire purpose of this tax bill is to cut middle-class taxes.\u201d But he warned earlier in the week that, to meet Democrats\u2019 demands to avoid cutting taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, \u201cwe would basically have to destroy the growth elements of this tax reform plan.\u201d Republicans argue that lightening the tax burden on businesses will generate economic growth to help offset the cost of the plan.Crucial details of the House and Senate versions of the plan are still unknown, in part because Republicans are struggling with how to pay for the tax cuts they are envisioning. Lawmakers have cleared the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut but are considering a plan that would cost much more than that, which will require them to find a way to offset the cuts by ending tax breaks and employing accounting maneuvers to stay within that defined amount.Many of the details still in flux are important because they would affect middle-class taxpayers directly, including the boundaries of income-tax brackets, the size of an expanded child tax credit and the fate of some deductions that Republicans had targeted for elimination, such as one for state and local taxes paid.A framework for the plan, released by Republican leaders in September, calls for cutting corporate rates; nearly doubling the standard deduction for individuals and couples; reducing the number of individual income tax brackets to three or four, from seven; overhauling the way in which the United States taxes multinational corporations; and taxing so-called pass-through entities, which are businesses whose owners pay taxes on profits through the individual tax code, at a rate of 25 percent.In the House and Senate, though, Democrats say they have had little input in drafting the tax legislation. Republican lawmakers have been meeting in recent weeks, in both chambers, to hash out the final language for the legislation. Democrats say they have not been invited.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that we\u2019re participating in a tax negotiation,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, who is chairman of the moderate New Democrat Coalition. \u201cWe\u2019re not throwing up our arms. It\u2019s the start of a process.\u201dMr. Himes and Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, including Suzan DelBene of Washington and Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, said they have discussed the bill with the committee chairman, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas. But, they said, Republicans have not agreed to some basic Democratic requests for the bill, including that it not add to the federal deficit.Past overhauls of the tax code have been marked by bipartisanship, most recently in 1986, when Democrats such as Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey joined Republicans such as Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon in delivering a bill to President Ronald Reagan.But Mr. Wyden is sharply critical of the bill Republicans are drafting now, which he said includes gifts to big businesses and the wealthy, \u201cfunny math\u201d for budget scoring that will assess the cost of the plan, increased deficits and \u201ca bunch of false promises to the middle class.\u201d He said he hoped that the bill would collapse and that Mr. Trump would turn to a bipartisan effort centered on the middle class instead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Makes Puzzling Claim That Rising Stock Market Erases Debt", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump suggested on Wednesday evening that a soaring stock market might be \u201cin a sense\u201d reducing the national debt, a statement that is not true, in any sense.\u201cThe country \u2014 we took it over and owed over $20 trillion,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Fox News personality Sean Hannity, following similar remarks he made earlier on Wednesday in a speech he delivered on tax issues in Pennsylvania. \u201cAs you know the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value.\u201d\u201cSo you could say, in one sense, we\u2019re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we\u2019re reducing debt.\u201dThe comments represented the latest in a long-shifting series of positions on debt issues for Mr. Trump as both president and candidate, which has included, at various points, proclaiming \u201cI love debt\u201d and also promising to pay off the entire national debt in eight years.Wednesday\u2019s remarks coincide with recent comments by Republican lawmakers and other administration officials playing down concerns about the federal debt. The White House and Republicans in Congress are pushing a tax rewrite that independent analysts warn could add trillions more to the debt, but administration officials say will more than pay for itself with increased economic growth.A budget resolution under consideration in the Senate would allow Republicans to pass a tax bill on party lines that would increase deficits by $1.5 trillion over a decade. Some prominent Republicans, including Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, have said they will not back a plan that would add to deficits, after additional economic growth is taken into account.Many analysts remain skeptical of the administration\u2019s growth promises, and they expressed frustration at Mr. Trump\u2019s comments conflating stock appreciation with debt reduction.\u201cThere seems to be way too much pivoting away from the basic fact that we will have to make some hard choices to get our unsustainable national debt under control,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in Washington. \u201cA growing stock market is not going to fix that.\u201dJared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cone of crazier things I\u2019ve heard this president say.\u201d\u201cThe best I can say on his behalf,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said, \u201cis it\u2019s mindless, wishful thinking, especially as his team is poised to seriously increase the debt through their big, regressive, unpaid-for tax cut.\u201dLinda Qiu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearsome Plague Epidemic Strikes Madagascar", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince August, the country has reported over 200 infections and 33 deaths.Schools, universities and other public buildings have closed so they can be sprayed to kill fleas, which may carry the infection. The government has forbidden large public gatherings, including sporting events and concerts.Fears that the outbreak could spread to other countries are rising.Late last month, plague struck a basketball tournament for teams from Indian Ocean countries, killing a coach from the Seychelles and infecting another from South Africa. The players are being monitored, Malagasy health authorities told the W.H.O.Pneumonic plague kills even faster than the better-known bubonic form, which is transmitted by flea bites and gets its name from the infected lymph nodes that form large, swollen \u201cbuboes\u201d in the groin, armpits and neck.Both forms caused the infamous Black Death of the mid-14th century, which is thought to have killed a third of Europe and caused major social upheavals.The Madagascar outbreak started in August, when a 31-year-old man originally thought to have malaria traveled by bush taxi from the central highlands to his home in the coastal city of Toamasina, passing through the capital, Antananarivo.Plague was not confirmed until blood samples collected from a 47-year-old woman who died on Sept. 11 in an Antananarivo hospital of what appeared to be pneumonia were tested at Madagascar\u2019s branch of the Pasteur Institute. The samples came up positive on a rapid test for plague.The W.H.O. was notified on Sept. 13.The W.H.O. calculated that the antibiotics it has shipped, and another 244,000 doses on the way, will be enough to treat 5,000 patients and protect another 100,000 people who might have been exposed.Personal protective gear and disinfection equipment, similar to that used during Ebola epidemics, also will be sent. Local health workers will be trained to safely treat patients and to trace all their contacts and offer them prophylactic antibiotics.The W.H.O. has released $1.5 million from its emergency fund and has appealed for $5.5 million more from donors.In June, prompted by the slow response to the Ebola crisis, the World Bank issued bonds to create a $500 million \u201cinsurance fund\u201d for fighting pandemics.The fund will also have a cash reserve of 50 million euros \u2014 about $58 million \u2014 that can be used to fight diseases not covered by the insurance. But the reserve is not due to be available until next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Really Buy That Home?", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFalling in love with a house is easy when it seems to have everything you want. But what if there is more to the house than your eye can see?A cracked pipe underground, a litigious neighbor, a long list of code violations \u2014 these are the kinds of red flags that buyers should look out for to make sure that seemingly ideal house doesn\u2019t turn out to be a money pit or some other type of real estate nightmare.In 2015, Dena Ferrara Driscoll thought she had found her new home: a four-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath in South Philadelphia \u2014 an older house but one that looked well maintained and perfect for her, her husband and two children.\u201cWe weren\u2019t too worried something big was going to come up,\u201d said Ms. Driscoll, 33, a grant writer for the School District of Philadelphia.Unfortunately, they were wrong. \u201cWhen the inspector came up from the basement, he had the grimmest look on his face,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. The reason: a cracked sewer pipe. Replacing it, the couple was told, would cost between $10,000 and $20,000.\u201cAn older woman lived in the house,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cShe flushes the toilet only so many times a day. But a family of four? We were definitely going to create a problem with this sewer pipe.\u201dTheir request for a credit to cover the work was denied, so they moved on and wound up buying a smaller house in the same neighborhood, but one where they didn\u2019t have to worry about finding sewage in the basement.Underground problems, bowed foundations, litigious homeowner associations and flips that are actually flops: A lot of things could put the brakes on a home purchase, and they might not be the things you notice while you\u2019re at the open house. Here are three categories of red flags to keep in mind while you\u2019re looking for that perfect house.STRUCTURAL OR UNDERGROUND ISSUESFinding an inspector who will be thorough is crucial once you\u2019ve made an offer on a home. And just as you would ask around for recommendations for a broker, get advice on inspectors, too. A great home inspector will point out every single little thing wrong with a property; one that isn\u2019t as good could miss a flaw that leads to big repair bills down the line.When reviewing an inspection report, keep in mind that while a faulty outlet or a leaky faucet may be a nuisance \u2013 as can be negotiations with a seller over who will cover the repair \u2013 they\u2019re often not enough to kill a deal. It\u2019s those things that can\u2019t really be fixed, or can be fixed only for a hefty price, that should have buyers reconsidering their dream homes.Water intrusion is another red flag because of how destructive water can be, he added. Sometimes there is an easy fix: If gutters are clogged, clean them out; if downspouts are emptying at the foundation, reorient them.\u201cBut if you live next to a river or creek that always overflows \u2014 well, you know that\u2019s going to be a long-term problem,\u201d Mr. Lesh said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when.\u201dIn 2011, water stopped a home purchase for Marcia Layton Turner, now 52, and her family on a house in Pittsford, N.Y. The house was the right size and had extras that made it appealing, like a barn that Ms. Turner, a writer, pictured using as a home office. But she and her husband were concerned that they could smell mildew in a basement guest room. They also spotted a dehumidifier running in another part of the basement.The home inspector raised a flag about water issues too. He noted that one of the basement walls was cold and damp, which he said was a sign of drainage problems. The inspector recommended adding a French drain system, which would take water away from the house, so they lowered their offer to factor in the cost. Before they could negotiate with the seller, another buyer came in with a better offer. The couple eventually bought another home in the same town.A few years later, Ms. Turner\u2019s husband, who runs a hearth-products store, was back in the home they nearly bought to give an estimate on converting a wood stove into a gas stove. The homeowner told him that they had spent about $40,000 on repairs, including installing a French drain. \u201cHe said something to the effect of \u2018Be glad you didn\u2019t buy it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Turner said.Other structural or underground items Mr. Lesh said to look out for in the inspection report: lead paint and asbestos. If the inspection does not include sending a camera down drainage and sewer lines, he recommended paying extra for it, especially if the home is older or near trees whose roots could be damaging pipes.Another potential issue: unremediated oil tanks, which Lesh said are a big issue on the East Coast, because so many homes there use oil for heat. Removing oil tanks and cleaning up a spill can be expensive and complicated if a state environmental agency gets involved.DOCUMENTSFor homes in areas that are near water or have flooded in the past, buyers will also need a certificate that states that the house is at the proper elevation. If you\u2019re shopping for a house in a beach town, it might also make sense to avoid the only house on the block that has not been elevated.For a home that has traded hands frequently in a short period of time, she suggested looking at how much it sold for each time. If each sale was at a significantly higher dollar figure, the turnover could be a sign that the property is in a hot neighborhood, not that something is wrong with it.For a house that has been flipped, Ms. Mendenhall advised buyers to demand proof that all contractors who have worked on the house have been paid. Otherwise, contractors could put a lien on the home \u2013 which would affect the new owner, not the flipper who stiffed them.But flips aren\u2019t always a red flag, Ms. Mendenhall noted: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. In many instances, somebody has taken the time and care and made an old home livable to a new family.\u201d The quality of construction, however, should be scrutinized.In 2012, Nikki Carpenter, 32, a research foundation grant manager, fell in love with a 100-year-old home in Scotch Plains, N.J., that had been abandoned for several years before being bought by an investor and renovated. Not only was it in a town that she and her husband, Joshua Pellittieri, loved, it was also big enough for their expanding family: She was seven months pregnant with their second child when they made the offer. And it looked beautiful.Their inspector, however, saw through that. The inspection report came back with a list of big problems, including standing water in the basement; a deck not built to code; a connector from the outside water main to the inside plumbing that had been installed backward; and hookups for a washer and dryer, but no drain for the washer or vent for the dryer. The inspector also found evidence of improperly removed asbestos.The sellers \u201cclaimed they had no idea there were so many things wrong with it,\u201d Ms. Carpenter said. She and her husband didn\u2019t try negotiating a lower price, or ask the sellers to make repairs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really trust them at that point, and didn\u2019t trust them to do anything further,\u201d she said. They stayed in their apartment, which they rented month to month, and eventually bought a different house in Scotch Plains.NEIGHBORSYou can\u2019t always pick your neighbors if they move in after you do, but you can get an idea of who is already there before you move in.\u201cAsk them how long ago major improvements were done, how it was paid for, and was it through special assessment or reserves,\u201d he said. If the association has been putting off maintenance or doing big-ticket repairs like a roof replacement or HVAC upgrade, buyers could be on the hook for a lot of additional costs very quickly.Also be wary of any board or association that has often been sued or that does a lot of suing, warned Ms. Giantomasi, the real estate lawyer. Lenders will often balk at financing such purchases \u2014 and maybe these are not the kind of people you want for neighbors, either.If the home is not in an association or co-op, look as closely as you can at neighboring properties and how well they are maintained. Hang out on the block at different times of day to get a feel for what it\u2019s like after school lets out, at night and during morning rush hour.If the inspection report reveals issues caused by a neighbor\u2019s property \u2014 like a crack in that shared driveway or water from the neighbor\u2019s land draining into the home that is for sale \u2014 buyers or their brokers should see how open the neighbors are to making the repair before the sale goes through.That could sink a deal for the seller. But it could also save the buyer a world of headaches if the property \u2013 and the problem \u2013 eventually becomes their own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Heart of Milwaukee, a Gleaming Tower Leads an Urban Renewal", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetMILWAUKEE \u2014 The skyline of this Great Lakes city is getting a makeover, led by a tower that unfurls like a magnificent curved glass sail on the Lake Michigan shoreline.Northwestern Mutual\u2019s striking $450 million, 32-story glass-and-steel office tower, which opened in August, is helping to reshape the city. It will be followed by the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 $524 million arena, financed with $250 million in taxpayer funds, which is set to open next year.The two buildings will serve as bookends for more than 100 big real estate projects just opened or under construction in Milwaukee\u2019s surging city center.An expanse of wide, windy, forlorn avenues not long ago, downtown Milwaukee has gained new life. The proprietors of restaurants and stores in the business district between the Milwaukee River and the lakefront say foot traffic is noticeably increasing.\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Sam Belton, the 64-year-old owner of City.Net Caf\u00e9, a coffee shop on Wisconsin Avenue, and a well-known Milwaukee jazz musician. \u201cWe\u2019ve needed a resurgence of activity in our city for a long time. We\u2019re finally starting to see it with all this construction.\u201dNew projects, the most since World War II, according to city leaders, are sprouting up everywhere in the city center. Milwaukee Downtown, a business development group, counts 34 significant commercial projects just completed or under construction and valued together at $1.4 billion. Construction of three hotels and renovation of a fourth are underway. New hotel construction is valued at $460 million, according to Milwaukee Downtown.Residential construction is experiencing a growth spurt, too. A total of $1.4 billion more will be spent on 63 residential projects that are completed or under construction. Seventeen more residential projects are proposed at a cost of $512.6 million. Since the start of 2017, the city counts 1,054 new residential apartments, and 1,436 more are under construction downtown. Next year, 1,700 more are expected to start construction.\u201cOur strategy is to rebuild from the center,\u201d said Tom Barrett, a fourth-term Democratic mayor. \u201cYou have to have a strong heart, and downtown is the heart of the city. Anybody who hasn\u2019t been here for a few years and comes back can see the change.\u201dThese days, a construction crane or concrete mixers are never far away. Northwestern Mutual is building a $100 million, 34-story residential tower with 10,000 square feet of retail space down the block from its new headquarters. BMO Harris Bank, a Midwestern banking company, is about to start construction on a $137 million, 25-story office building near City Hall. Marquette University and Aurora Health Care are building a $120 million athletic performance research center on the university campus. And a $50 million, 10-story, 220-room Westin Hotel opened this year.Other big cities of the Great Lakes are also experiencing waves of downtown construction. Detroit just opened the $862.9 million Little Caesars Arena, which will anchor a $2.1 billion, 650,000-square-foot sports and entertainment district. Cleveland last year completed the $50 million reconstruction of Public Square, which helped prompt more than $3.5 billion in investment in 29 projects that have been completed or are scheduled to open in the city center, according to the Downtown Cleveland Alliance, a civic economic development group.Fifty-four high-rise residential towers are under construction in Chicago, according to city figures. River Point, a 52-story, $500 million office tower on the Chicago River, opened this year. The building, with a reflective curved glass exterior, was designed by Pickard Chilton, an architectural firm in New Haven that also designed the Northwestern Mutual tower in Milwaukee.Milwaukee\u2019s downtown construction looks to be a pivotal point for a city that has struggled with a decline in industrial activity and a rise in income inequality for decades. The home of Harley-Davidson, Johnson Controls, Allen-Bradley and three national breweries, Milwaukee developed into a Great Lakes manufacturing powerhouse in the decades after World War II. According to census data, median incomes ranked among the nation\u2019s highest in 1960, when the population peaked at 741,000.A four-day riot in the summer of 1967 started a flight of white residents to the suburbs that grew steadily as globalization forced factories to close. By 1999, according to census figures, Milwaukee\u2019s population had declined to 572,000, 23 percent below the peak.Cities do not recover overnight. Residents and city officials credit former Mayor John Norquist, who served from 1988 to 2004, with innovative urban design projects \u2014 building a walkway along the Milwaukee River, redesigning several bridges and dismantling the Park East Freeway. These and other projects focused Milwaukee\u2019s development strategy on the river and lakefront, making the central city more inviting for housing developers and buyers.Mr. Barrett has focused his administration on closing the income gap by generating jobs for unemployed and underemployed residents, particularly from the city\u2019s large African-American population. The city requires developers that receive public financing to hire local companies for a quarter of their subcontractors; 40 percent of project work hours must come from unemployed or underemployed residents.\u201cWe\u2019re building a pipeline of men and women of color who represent the city,\u201d said Rocky Marcoux, commissioner of the Department of City Development. \u201cFor 30 years, minorities have basically been locked out of the trades. A lot of smaller companies, given the experience working with the big contractors, are now seeing work coming their way on noncity projects.\u201dNorthwestern Mutual\u2019s 1.1 million-square-foot shoreline tower, large enough for 2,400 employees, replaces a smaller 1970s-era office on the same site.Jon Pickard, the principal architect, pitched the tower on an angle to engage a ground-level public commons, fill the interior spaces with daylight and embrace a panorama of urban density and blue water.\u201cLike a graceful sloop, the billowing sail of the Northwestern Mutual tower reflects the lake, the city and the sky,\u201d he said.Eager to assist Northwestern, a 160-year-old financial services company that reported $28.16 billion in revenue last year, the city agreed to $54 million in public financing, or roughly half of the extra cost of constructing an urban office tower instead of a suburban campus.John E. Schlifske, Northwestern Mutual\u2019s chief executive and chairman, said the tower\u2019s scale and design had been motivated by two goals: keeping the company\u2019s headquarters and most of its employees in the city center and producing a high-performance structure impressive enough to attract talent and become a signature of Milwaukee\u2019s skyline.\u201cWe want to see Milwaukee thrive,\u201d Mr. Schlifske said. \u201cWe felt it was in Milwaukee\u2019s best interest and in ours.\u201dAdvertisement"}

More on that in a minute.Russia is Topic A in the Senate today, especially with lawyers for Facebook, Google and Twitter set to testify before the Judiciary Committee.

Populist conservatives are particularly hostile to big tech, given its size and pervasive influence, as well as its support for immigration rights and other causes that clash with their economic nationalism.Let\u2019s face it: Despite the impending tax plan rollout and the picking of a nominee for Federal Reserve chairman, Washington will still be largely talking about the criminal charges that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates face in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.Some of those conversations will concern Tom Barrack, one of President Trump\u2019s closest advisers, who has emerged as connected to the two men. Could that see him pushed out of the White House inner circle?Some White House advisers are unhappy with Thomas J. Barrack Jr., Trump\u2019s longtime friend and chair of his inauguration, whom they hold responsible for keeping Gates in the Trump orbit long after Manafort resigned as campaign chairman in August 2016, according to people familiar with the situation. Barrack has been Gates\u2019s patron of late, steering political work to him and, until Monday, employing him as director of the Washington office of his real estate investment company.\u201cIn the midst of such a major investigation, it\u2019s inappropriate for me to have any comment until the process has finished its course.\u201dThe latest question is whether the corporate tax rate should go down to 20 percent from 35 percent immediately or in stages.Other challenges \u2022 Remember that Republicans can\u2019t lose more than two senators to pass the tax legislation without Democratic votes.The point here is that the Trump administration is shifting away from the president\u2019s own words. They\u2019re not saying the rich shouldn\u2019t get any tax relief \u2014 they\u2019re saying the rich deserve to get one.Worth readingThe question is whether SoftBank really intends to walk away. We\u2019ve heard that the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s board is unhappy with the prospect of losing control in a merger: At a board meeting last Friday, several directors questioned whether it was wise to take only about 40 percent of the combined wireless business \u2014 a smaller amount than Deutsche Telekom \u2014 because T-Mobile is currently bigger than Sprint.We\u2019ve seen hardball negotiating tactics from SoftBank and Masayoshi Son before: The Japanese conglomerate expressed interest in buying the cable company Charter Communications earlier this year before resuming talks with T-Mobile.Critics\u2019 corner\u2022 Credit Suisse named Steven Geller as its head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, according to an internal memo.

But no matter their form, the salvos against the credibility of Jona S. Rechnitz, a donor to Mayor Bill de Blasio who says he bought access to the mayor and other city officials, have shared a single premise:\u201cMr. Rechnitz, you are a liar, correct?\u201dThat most recent iteration of the accusation came on Monday from Henry Mazurek, a defense lawyer in a federal corruption trial in which Mr. Rechnitz is a key government witness.Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s claims come at an inconvenient time for Mr. de Blasio, with the mayoral election on Nov. 7. But even if the allegations do not harm the mayor\u2019s re-election prospects \u2014 Mr. de Blasio holds a commanding lead in the polls \u2014 they have brought a political headache back to life, with the mayor\u2019s photo splashed across the city\u2019s tabloids all weekend.\u201cThe federal government looked at this in excruciating detail, but you somehow want to elevate a criminal to the front pages as having equal validity to federal prosecutors,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf you want to do that, feel free.\u201dIn court, defense lawyers were equally aggressive in their efforts to erode Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s credibility.When Mr. Mazurek asked Mr. Rechnitz about statements he had made to federal agents claiming not to remember whether he had sex with a prostitute aboard a private jet he chartered for several police officers, Mr. Rechnitz denied ever making those statements. In response, Mr. Mazurek read aloud the agents\u2019 report on the statements.\u201cI never said that,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said.Mr. Rechnitz made no effort to endear himself to jurors. He was alternately combative, flip and sullen. When asked to confirm answers he had given just days before, he often declined to give a straightforward answer.\u201cIf you say so,\u201d he said once, or, \u201cIt could be I said those words, sure.\u201d\u201cI had lied to investigators until I came forward and told them the truth,\u201d he said at another point.And there was this bit of verbal acrobatics:\u201cAre you able to tell the difference between the truth and a lie?\u201d Mr. Mazurek asked.\u201cI don\u2019t understand the question,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz replied.Several times, Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s responses elicited audible reactions from audience members, prompting a warning from Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.Most notably, Mr. Mazurek highlighted a conversation Mr. Rechnitz had with federal agents when he was being questioned about his involvement with city police officers, whom he has admitted showering with gifts in order to secure favors. Mr. Rechnitz had initially told investigators that he had sought relationships with officers because, as the grandson of Holocaust survivors, he was taught to befriend law enforcement officials to \u201chelp ensure the mistakes of the past were not repeated,\u201d Mr. Mazurek said.\u201cI was trying to wiggle my way out of the truth,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said.\u201cAnd you invoked the memory of the Holocaust to wiggle your way out of the truth?\u201d Mr. Mazurek said.\u201cIt sounds that way, yes,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz responded.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Booker Prize\u2019s Bad History", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe Man Booker Prize, one of the shiniest baubles and most generous purses in English letters, was awarded today to the American writer George Saunders for his novel \u201cLincoln in the Bardo.\u201d The occasion invites us to reflect on how the residue of slavery and white supremacy permeates our cultural life, and determines whose histories are celebrated and whose are erased.During my own research for a coming book about art and resistance in my parents\u2019 native Guyana, I came across a collection of documents held by Britain\u2019s National Archives that demonstrated the kind of casual racial opportunism that should also be associated with Booker. In 1815, soon after the British successfully elbowed away Dutch, French and Spanish rivals to claim the small patch of rain forest land at the northern edge of South America, 22-year-old Josias Booker left Britain to help manage a cotton plantation in what was then British Guiana.Soon, he invited his brothers, George, William and Richard, to join him in the hottest new start-up industry: sugar. In addition to growing cane harvested by enslaved African workers, the brothers established their own ship fleet and incorporated as Booker Brothers & Co. in 1834.The first threat to the family business came when British Parliament voted to abolish slavery in 1833. Lucky for the Booker brothers, key members of Britain\u2019s political, religious and banking institutions also had considerable slave holdings. Investors convinced debt-ridden Parliament to pay out 20 million pounds (about \u00a32 billion in today\u2019s currency, or about $2.6 billion) to compensate slave owners across the empire. it was the largest bailout in global history until the bank bailout of 2009.Parliament\u2019s bailout scheme richly benefited the Bookers. Slave owners negotiated immediate cash payments to compensate for the loss of their work force \u2014 according to calculations made by the historian Hilary McD. Beckles in his book \u201cBritain\u2019s Black Debt,\u201d politically powerful British Guiana owners got about of 50 pounds per slave, while older colonies such as Barbados and Jamaica fetched 20 pounds. Since the actual market value of this human chattel was set at 47 million pounds, Parliament decreed that my enslaved Guyanese ancestors had to work as unpaid \u201capprentices\u201d for a period of several years after the owners cashed out to pay off the rest of their own market value.The Booker brothers and their associates collectively submitted claims on 52 slaves, giving their fledgling business a cash injection of what amounts to 317,240 pounds (about $418,000) in today\u2019s currency, according to archives. Because many British Guiana planters used abolition of slavery as an opportunity to liquidate their human assets and get out of the sugar business, the Booker brothers were able to acquire them cheaply. Their enslaved work force grew to 315 people in the period immediately following emancipation. After squeezing the workers for four more years of unpaid labor, on Aug. 1, 1838, at the appointed time, the Booker brothers manumitted them. \u201cToday I had the privilege of mustering the slaves and giving them the good tidings that they were free, resulting in great rejoicing throughout the plantation,\u201d George Booker wrote in a letter to his brother Septimus.Rather than pay fair wages to free African workers, British planters such as the Bookers convinced the British government to help finance voyages to collect replacement sugar workers \u2014 indentured workers from India. British Guiana was first in line to receive these workers, and by the time the practice ended in 1917 amid gross human-rights abuses, the colony had received 240,000 Indian indentured workers. People of East Indian descent remain Guyana\u2019s largest ethnic group, and continue to be locked in an often bitter competition with the African workers whom colonial society sought to discard as surplus.The Booker family moved on and passed its holdings over to a partner, McConnell, in the 1880s, and the Booker McConnell brand continued to expand. The company went public on the London Stock Exchange in 1920. Booker McConnell used this fortune to establish a world empire of its own.It also aggressively expanded within British Guiana. After World War II, Booker owned 15 of the remaining 18 sugar estates. Just as it took over failed sugar plantations, the firm took over many other businesses in British Guiana: real estate, retail stores, transportation, pharmaceuticals, insurance, advertising, newspapers, radio stations. The company\u2019s domination of the economic and political life was so complete that the colony became acidly referred to as \u201cBooker\u2019s Guiana.\u201d At the time Mr. Berger gave his 1972 speech, Booker was still drawing 45 percent of its profits from British Guiana, according to company records.By calling attention to this exploitation in Guyana during his Booker Prize acceptance speech, the white British writer Mr. Berger echoed local leaders such as Dr. Cheddi B. Jagan. In fiery speeches and pamphlets, Mr. Jagan, an American-trained dentist whose Indo-Guyanese family had been employed by Booker for generations, exposed how \u201cBig Sugar,\u201d based in London, dodged taxes and refused to invest in local infrastructure. When Mr. Jagan was elected chief minister of British Guiana in 1953, the first election under universal suffrage, British authorities sent troops to remove him from power.Like more than half of the people born in Guyana, my parents left. They departed in 1970. The country of their birth has one of the world\u2019s highest emigration rates. Fifty years after independence, Guyana has virtually fallen off the global map. It is now the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, behind Haiti. Its currency trades at $200 to $1 U.S. Guyana has the world\u2019s second-highest suicide rate, nearly double the global average.Facing global erasure, amid economic, racial and political turmoil, Guyana\u2019s poets, painters and musicians are creating epic, bravura displays of resilience, vitality and cultural memory. If not for the accident of history, I imagine these artists would get the kind of resources, support and recognition that are rightfully lavished upon the nominees of the Man Booker Prize.So, by all means, let\u2019s celebrate the literary excellence achieved by George Saunders and all the nominees of this year\u2019s Man Booker Prize. As we do, let\u2019s recognize the people who have paid its price.Natalie Hopkinson is the author of the forthcoming \u201cA Mouth Is Always Muzzled: Six Dissidents, Five Continents and the Art of Resistance,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.Advertisement"}

He was returned to Parliament for a third term in the country\u2019s Sept. 23 elections.While New Zealand is a small country, it is a member of the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence sharing partnership along with the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia. And so vulnerabilities in New Zealand\u2019s government could have wider import.Mr. Yang admitted that in the 1980s and early \u201990s, before emigrating to Australia and then moving to New Zealand to teach at a university, he studied and taught at two Chinese educational institutions run by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, China\u2019s armed forces.He said he had not named the Chinese military institutions on his application for New Zealand citizenship, and had instead listed \u201cpartner institutions\u201d as his employers, because that was what the Chinese \u201csystem\u201d had told him to do.Mr. Yang conceded that he had taught English to spies, but said he had never been a spy himself, was no longer a member of the Communist Party, and had been contracted and paid only as a so-called civilian officer.Mr. Yang has not been officially investigated in New Zealand or charged with espionage.But Nicholas Eftimiades, a former officer with the Central Intelligence Agency with extensive experience on China matters, said the title of civilian officer was a fluid one in China.Mr. Eftimiades, now a lecturer at Penn State Harrisburg in Pennsylvania, said officers moved seamlessly between military and civilian assignments to include Chinese army units and work in the defense industry, think tanks and universities.\u201cWhether in uniform or not, these personnel are still actively engaged in espionage,\u201d said Mr. Eftimiades, who also worked with the Defense Intelligence Agency in the United States.Several China experts said in interviews that it was not possible for people to willingly \u201cleave\u201d China\u2019s Communist Party, as Mr. Yang said he did, unless they had been expelled from it. Mr. Yang has not denounced the party.Rodney Jones, a New Zealand economist who lives in Beijing and who has worked in Asia for 30 years, said that an \u201cunrepentant\u201d former member of the Communist Party should not be eligible to be a New Zealand lawmaker. He said that Mr. Yang should resign from Parliament.Mr. Jones said that New Zealand needed better representation of its Chinese population in Parliament, but that Mr. Yang\u2019s ascension showed that New Zealand had become a \u201ctributary state\u201d of China.The leadership of both major political parties in New Zealand said they were not concerned by the revelations. Bill English, the incumbent prime minister whose party Mr. Yang belongs to, said through a spokesman that he did not \u201csee any obvious signs of anything inappropriate\u201d and would not be interviewed on the matter.Mr. English said the National Party had been aware of Mr. Yang\u2019s background, and Mr. Yang had made no attempt to hide it.Mr. Jones criticized the prime minister\u2019s lack of alarm, saying the disclosure warranted an investigation.The revelation comes as both the National and Labour parties have come under scrutiny in a report on China\u2019s influence on the New Zealand government by Anne-Marie Brady, a political-science professor at New Zealand\u2019s University of Canterbury.Ms. Brady said that since the ascension of President Xi Jinping, China\u2019s government has mounted an aggressive campaign of using soft power to influence New Zealand\u2019s politics, economy and society, including through campaign donations.She said the Chinese-language media in New Zealand was subject to extreme censorship, and accused both Mr. Yang and Raymond Huo, an ethnic Chinese lawmaker from the center-left Labour Party, of being subject to influence by the Chinese Embassy and community organizations it used as front groups to push the country\u2019s agenda.Mr. Huo strongly denied any \u201cinsinuations against his character,\u201d saying his connections with Chinese groups and appearances at their events were just part of being an effective lawmaker.Mr. Yang would not comment on the report, other than to say in a statement that \u201callegations about my loyalty to New Zealand\u201d were \u201ca racially and politically timed smear.\u201d\u201cWhen he speaks, he speaks more as a Chinese government representative, instead of a New Zealand lawmaker,\u201d Mr. Chen said.New Zealand has become increasingly dependent on China as a market for farm products, especially dairy goods, and the two countries have been in talks to expand a free-trade agreement signed in 2008.Despite the criticism, Mr. Yang has continued to appear alongside Wang Lutong, China\u2019s ambassador to New Zealand, at public events, including for China\u2019s National Day celebrations this week, when he posed for photos with the ambassador and a Chinese military attach\u00e9.\u201cNew Zealand has become so fearful of the Chinese economic power we\u2019re prepared to throw our values and standards overboard,\u201d Mr. Jones said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for the fear, except for elites in New Zealand who may lose money personally.\u201dXiuzhong Xu contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}

These are people, whether ethically suspect or downright criminal, whose sense of decency has gone haywire. The word \u201cdisgraced\u201d has appeared so routinely before their names, you\u2019d think it was what their parents called them. Yet they keep demanding voter affection, having convinced themselves that the city and state cannot possibly get along without them. They\u2019re our zombie candidates.They\u2019re men like Eliot Spitzer, who forfeited the governorship in a prostitution scandal but somehow had to run for city comptroller in 2013. Or like former Representative Anthony Weiner (Need we really go into detail?), who ran for mayor, also in 2013. Or like Hiram Monserrate, the former City Council member and state senator, who tried last month to regain a Council seat despite his record of misusing public funds and slashing his girlfriend\u2019s face.In announcing his candidacy, Mr. Grimm apologized for past wrongdoing. He didn\u2019t sound thoroughly repentant, though, essentially calling himself the victim of a political witch hunt who had \u201cthe entire Obama Justice Department weaponized against me.\u201d Naturally, he invoked the Republican clich\u00e9 du jour, promising to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d despite having been in the muck himself.For now, the New York zombies have yet to win. But who knows what mood Staten Island voters will be in next year? If Mr. Grimm seeks a patron saint, he could try Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the roguish congressman from Harlem whose scandals led fellow House members to oust him in 1967. He bounced back to win re-election a year later. (Soon enough, Harlem voters, too, wearied of Powell. He lost to Charles Rangel in 1970.)But the reality is that, his vanity aside, there\u2019s no compelling reason for Mr. Grimm to run; it\u2019s not as if Staten Island lacks honorable representation. Pamela Chen, the federal judge in his criminal case, got it right when she said at his sentencing, \u201cYour moral compass, Mr. Grimm, needs some reorientation.\u201dWhat he really needs to do is learn to blush \u2014 then find something other than a taxpayer-financed position to fill his days.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Grew Steadily, Thanks to Loans and Homes", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China turned to a tried-and-true recipe to cook up another three months of respectable growth.Heavy lending by state-owned banks, brisk government spending and strong exports helped keep China\u2019s economy growing briskly and steadily. China\u2019s statistical agency said on Thursday that the economy had grown 6.8 percent in the July-to-September period, compared with the same quarter a year ago.President Xi Jinping had put heavy pressure on practically every government ministry to make sure that the economy put in a solid performance. The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s twice-a-decade congress began this week, and it\u2019s a time when the country\u2019s leaders want predictability and an image of strength.The figure announced on Thursday was similar to other results from recent quarters, a trend that makes many economists doubt the reliability of China\u2019s headline economic numbers. Still other figures \u2014 including retail spending, housing sales and trade figures \u2014 suggest an economy growing steadily under the guiding hand of the government.Chinese officials say they are working hard to control China\u2019s ballooning debt. The third quarter may not be a good example of that. Measures of credit and money supply grew faster than the economy itself in August and September, according to Chinese data.China\u2019s debt has soared over the past decade as banks and other lenders, working at the urging of Beijing, turned on money spigots to fuel growth. That has led to worries about the stability of the financial system powering the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Chinese debt accumulation had slowed in some recent quarters, suggesting that the country\u2019s leaders were getting a handle on the problem. But some Western experts are skeptical that China has really done much.\u201cWhile recent policies to contain financial risks have slowed the pace of debt accumulation, China has yet to achieve stabilizing debt ratios, and is farther still from outright deleveraging,\u201d Andrew Fennell, the director of sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings, wrote in an email.Addressing the Communist Party Congress on Wednesday, Mr. Xi told officials, \u201cReal estate is for living in, not for speculation.\u201dPlenty of people in China apparently feel otherwise. Surging prices in cities like Beijing and Shanghai have led some consumers to feel prosperous but have raised concerns about housing affordability and the potential for sudden drops. Chinese officials have worked in recent months to limit housing-related financing in the biggest cities, among other steps to stop the surge.It is not just housing. A strong increase in fixed-asset investment last month reaffirmed the central importance of construction that includes roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Considerable building has come from local governments, which contributed heavily to China\u2019s current hefty debt load.Zhou Xiaochuan, the long-serving governor of the central bank, warned in a speech in Washington on Sunday that a large chunk of the debt accumulated by Chinese state-owned enterprises might actually represent disguised borrowing by local governments.\u201cChinese local governments borrowed money from various financing platforms, which caused relatively too much debt,\u201d he said.China can thank the world for some of its third-quarter performance. Its exports grew at a healthy pace as a global economic recovery improved demand for Chinese-made goods.Of course, China\u2019s economic success is partly built on exports. Yet China can no longer compete on costs against cheaper countries as its workers demand more. China is trying to shift to manufacturing more valuable products, which would help it develop its economy and nurture a new generation of more sophisticated, technically adept workers.China also bought up more of the world\u2019s products during the quarter. Its imports grew faster than exports, thanks in part to China\u2019s stronger currency, which gives consumers more firepower when purchasing things from abroad. That also signals that many of China\u2019s consumers feel comfortable spending money.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Together with some of those co-workers, Mr. Kovalyov is developing a new Minsk start-up, AR Squad, which creates augmented reality content.One of the first masks the other company developed was one resembling Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Belarus\u2019s president, who has ruled for more than two decades. He is prone to publicity stunts like picking potatoes at his estate or taking his teenage son, Nikolai, commonly referred to as Kolya, to sit at international meetings in a military uniform.Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s mask featured his trademark comb-over hair and bushy mustache, but was not considered offensive. On the contrary, Mr. Lukashenko began to believe that the tech industry could become a magic wand to help him end the country\u2019s chronic dependency on Russia.\u201cCreation of an IT state is our ambitious but reachable goal,\u201d Mr. Lukashenko said at a gathering of lawmakers and bureaucrats this summer. \u201cThis will allow us to make Belarus even more modern and prosperous and will let Belarussians look into the future with confidence.\u201dMr. Lukashenko, who once called the internet \u201ca pile of garbage,\u201d began to utter improbable words for a former manager of a collective farm \u2014 about the need to develop artificial intelligence, driverless cars and blockchain technology, which allows multiple parties to keep shared digital records.His government has taken several steps to encourage the tech industry\u2019s development, like granting visa-free entry to citizens of 79 countries, including all Western states, when entering through the Minsk airport. Mr. Lukashenko also wants to lift restrictions on currency transfers to encourage venture financing for start-ups.Belarus produces top-level technical talent, an inheritance from its Soviet past, said Arkady M. Dobkin, who immigrated to the United States in the 1990s and established a software company there.EPAM\u2019s headquarters is in Newtown, Pa., but its main development hub is in Minsk, where more than 6,000 of its technology specialists work.\u201cI think it was the absence of oil that made Belarus do this,\u201d said Mr. Dobkin, 57. \u201cHere, universities produce more highly qualified specialists than the internal market needs.\u201dSergei Chaly, an outspoken economist and former government official, calls Belarus \u201ca dying country with bitcoins.\u201dYevgeny Lipkovich, a popular blogger who made a career out of ridiculing Belarusian bureaucrats, said the only reason the tech industry had found some success in Belarus is that the government \u201ccannot seize people\u2019s brains.\u201d He joked, \u201cIf they want to capture an IT company, what would they get, computers?\u201dPolitics doesn\u2019t seem a big concern for many in the tech crowd, even if young political activists use group chats on the call and messaging app Viber \u2014 an Israeli company whose development hub is in Minsk \u2014 to coordinate activities and plan rallies.Tanks have an important cultural meaning for Belarus and other former Soviet states, where almost every family has an ancestor who fought in one.\u201cHe plays tanks, but this is controlled,\u201d Mr. Lukashenko said of his son at a televised meeting with schoolteachers.\u201cOne hour for tanks, 1.5 hours for music,\u201d the president added, explaining how he controls his son\u2019s time spent on the game. \u201cTwo hours for tanks \u2014 four hours for music.\u201d\u201cFour hours is difficult,\u201d Mr. Lukashenko said, \u201cso he doesn\u2019t play for longer than one hour.\u201dThe Minsk Journal article on Friday about the sprouting technology industry in Belarus misstated the given name of a popular blogger who made a career out of ridiculing Belarusian bureaucrats.

{"Headline": "Is the Czech Republic Turning on the West?", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 As Communist Europe collapsed in the early 1990s, four countries on its western periphery \u2014 the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary \u2014 came together to form the Visegrad Group. The four were relatively modernized, and the goal of the new organization was to coordinate closer ties between them and the European Union, which they joined en masse in 2004.The Visegrad Group once stood as a beacon for post-Communist integration, but today it symbolizes the failure of the West to completely integrate Central and Eastern Europe. Across all four countries, leading politicians agitate against the European Union, portraying it as an imposing, undemocratic force, even as the second coming of the Soviet Union. Visegrad members consistently decline to follow the Western mainstream, refuse to take in Muslim refugees, and regard democratic checks and balances as annoying hindrances to real men doing real politics.This trend strengthened over the weekend, when an anti-establishment party, Ano, won 30 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic and a far-right party got just over 10 percent, both coming in far ahead of the center right and center left. Though Ano has committed to staying in the European Union, it also rails against overreach from Brussels and the flow of migrants across its borders.The shift in the Visegrad countries is nothing new; it has emerged over the past decade, while Europe was distracted by the debt crisis and focused on northern creditors and southern debtors. This was such an energy-sapping endeavor that Europe overlooked the other growing division: between Western believers in the European Union and Eastern nonbelievers. Meanwhile, a cult of outsiderism has taken hold in Central Europe.Both West and East share some of the blame for this development. The Westerners have assumed that the Easterners would be content with less \u2014 that they would be happy simply to be included in the European Union and could therefore be treated as second-class equals (for example, workers from the East face extensive discrimination in Western employment markets).At the same time, Visegrad leaders have made political hay out of such mistreatment, rather than working to correct for it. That\u2019s not to say that the Visegrad Group doesn\u2019t put forward constructive responses or that there isn\u2019t a way forward. But the rhetoric ensures that the group\u2019s proposals will be ignored or rejected out of hand in Brussels. As a result, governments from Warsaw to Budapest retreat into sulking mode.While Hungary, Slovakia and Poland have taken the authoritarian route, the Czech Republic, with its more secular, democratic grounding, long seemed like the best hope for a bridge between the two sides. But the victory by Ano and its billionaire leader, Andrej Babis, make that unlikely.People who know Mr. Babis\u2019s business style warn that he is a ruthless businessman, more interested in expanding his personal power than in furthering the common good. Apart from an empire in agricultural industry, he owns several newspapers and a radio station. After allegations of tax fraud, he was removed as minister of finance in May. There are also investigations into claims that Mr. Babis illegally received European Union subsidies for one of his hotels.Yet all of this does not seem to impair his popularity. On the contrary, in the eyes of many Czechs it makes Mr. Babis one of them, a guy who stands up against the bigotry and double standards of the establishment, or, as one slogan goes, against the Prague \u201ccoffeehouse thugs.\u201d Almost 30 years after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the heritage of freedom fighters like Vaclav Havel has been replaced by the chauvinism of the underdog.Of course, a certain disillusionment with the promises of the West is understandable. When today\u2019s Visegrad states joined the European Union 13 years ago, they expected stability. Instead they joined a club that soon slipped into permanent crisis mode, first over the future of the eurozone and then over the mass influx of migrants. Freedom, it turned out, did not mean security \u2014 just new insecurities. To many Central Europeans, it was shocking to learn that you could be part of the West and still fear being left behind.Along with that shock came a lack of cultural preparedness for the new competitiveness. Forty years of Communism left people with an immense distrust of one another and of the political class. The era of totalitarianism was never really processed. Even young Czechs, who did not experience Communist rule as adults (if at all), describe their society as being shot through with distrust, leaving them wary of their neighbors.Czech society places a premium on scapegoating and victimization, says Erik Tabery, the editor in chief of Respekt, a newsmagazine based in Prague. In his book \u201cThe Left Nation,\u201d Mr. Tabery argues that the Czech Republic needs a more proactive, cooperative foreign policy that will push the country farther into the West. But he admits that positions like this have left him and like-minded colleagues very lonely in Prague.It is true that Western Europe has cared too little for its new Eastern members since they joined the union, and it is understandable that many there feel treated like second-class Europeans. The West never took seriously the different experiences and legacies east of the Elbe River. American soldiers never set foot there after 1945, nor was there a 1968 generation to force a phase of messy, republican puberty.But the Central Europeans have done too little to make themselves fit for freedom and ready to be taken seriously by the West. While liberalizing their economies, they have forgotten to liberalize their minds. East and West need to engage in couples therapy soon. Otherwise, Brexit might eventually look like one of Europe\u2019s minor problems.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicare Official Recounts \u2018Hostile\u2019 Interactions With Menendez", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 A \u201cvisibly angry\u201d Senator Robert Menendez grew increasingly \u201chostile\u201d during a phone call with a top official from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2009, eventually hanging up on the official, according to testimony.And Mr. Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, maintained a similar angry disposition during a meeting in 2012 with Senator Harry Reid and Kathleen Sebelius, who at the time was the secretary of Health and Human Services, according to Jonathan Blum, who participated in the call and in the meeting, and who took the witness stand in a federal courtroom here on Monday.The description of the two interactions by Mr. Blum, a former principal deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, offered a window into direct action taken by Mr. Menendez on behalf of his friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy ophthalmologist, who was involved in a dispute over whether he had overbilled Medicare by roughly $8.9 million.In both instances, Mr. Blum said, Mr. Menendez never specifically mentioned the doctor by name but still railed against a billing practice that Mr. Blum said he knew affected only one person: Dr. Melgen.While Mr. Blum stated that interactions with members of Congress were common, he said his interactions with Mr. Menendez stuck out in his mind for two reasons.\u201cOne is the tone of the conversation was very aggressive, was very adversarial,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd two, that most of my interactions, just about every interaction I had with a member of Congress, was either about a national policy that affected a million stakeholders throughout the country or about a specific issue in that member\u2019s own state or district.\u201dDr. Melgen, he pointed out, is from Florida.\u201cI pressed several times to understand, from our staff, the connection between the senator and Dr. Melgen,\u201d Mr. Blum said.After about 15 minutes, Mr. Blum said, \u201cthe call was ended quite quickly.\u201dJames P. Cooney, a federal prosecutor, asked Mr. Blum to clarify what he meant by \u201cvery quickly.\u201d\u201cI believe that he hung up on me.\u201dA defense lawyer, during cross-examination, sought to make clear that the senator never mentioned the doctor.\u201cYou do not recall Senator Menendez ever raising Dr. Melgen?\u201d Kirk Ogrosky, a defense lawyer for Dr. Melgen, asked Mr. Blum.\u201cI don\u2019t believe he did, no,\u201d he answered.In his questioning, Mr. Ogrosky repeatedly discussed the intricacies of the billing practices at the center of Dr. Melgen\u2019s dispute: The doctor was dividing a single-dose vial into multiple doses and then charging Medicare based on the doses and not the vial, a complicated practice known as multidosing.And, Mr. Ogrosky said, the senator\u2019s tone with Mr. Blum was not one of hostility, but of frustration at confusing health policies.But his examination was routinely interrupted by objections from the prosecutors, prompting Judge William H. Walls to excuse the jury and reprimand Mr. Ogrosky, who defended his line of questioning.\u201cThey put this witness on the stand to say Menendez\u2019s tone was to strong-arm the government into doing something,\u201d Mr. Ogrosky told the judge. \u201cAnd I\u2019m showing that his frustration was born out of the substance of what this witness knows.\u201dMr. Blum also recalled a similarly contentious meeting three years later that he took part in along with Ms. Sebelius, Mr. Reid, Mr. Menendez and aides.\u201cI felt like I was being put on the defensive, and it was a very angry exchange,\u201d Mr. Blum said.At one point, he recalled, Mr. Menendez said that Mr. Blum was contradicting positions he had previously stated publicly.\u201cHe handed me a transcript about a deposition,\u201d Mr. Blum said. \u201cI pointed out very quickly that the person that was giving that deposition was not me.\u201dMr. Menendez handed the sheet back to an aide and continued questioning Mr. Blum. After about 30 minutes, the two men were visibly irritated, Mr. Blum testified, and Ms. Sebelius said she had to leave for another meeting.Mr. Menendez told both Mr. Blum and Ms. Sebelius that he \u201dwas not going to let the issue rest,\u201d Mr. Blum testified, and \u201cthat he was going to use the authority that he had being a member of the Senate Finance Committee to press the issue going forward.\u201dBut, Mr. Blum continued, Mr. Menendez never followed through and the issue never came up again.The trial recessed on Monday before Mr. Menendez\u2019s lawyers could cross-examine Mr. Blum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Superstar Economy, a Bull Market in Superstar Harassers", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the recent wave of reports of workplace sexual harassment, a recurring theme stands out: the willingness of companies\u2019 supposed overseers to ignore credible allegations in order to retain a perceived star.\u201cWhen the superstar misbehaves, employers may perceive themselves in a quandary,\u201d the report said. \u201cThey may be tempted to ignore the misconduct because, the thinking goes, losing the superstar would be too costly.\u201dSuperstar harassers account for a fraction of the harassment allegations in the workplace, according to Chai R. Feldblum, one of the commissioners who oversaw the report, but these individuals can have considerable impact. Superstars are able to evade the consequences of their actions for years, and they exert outsize influence over their organizations.And because the labor market has created more and more superstars in recent decades, as economists have repeatedly found, the number of harassers in that category is probably growing.\u201cThe superstar harassers do cast a long shadow,\u201d Ms. Feldblum said. \u201cIf it is well known in a workplace that someone at that level is getting away with bad behavior, that then sends a message down the ranks.\u201dPartly as a result, the costs of retaining a superstar harasser outweigh the benefits, even in narrow economic terms, according to research cited by the commission.\u201cThey don\u2019t see threats even if they\u2019re right in front of their face,\u201d Cameron Anderson, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an author of the second study, said in an interview. Alluding to superstar harassers, Professor Anderson added, \u201cThey\u2019re so focused on sexual gratification, they don\u2019t see the moral, ethical and legal problems.\u201dMany people in an organization, from the most junior scheduler to the chief executive, have some form of power. The distinctive feature of superstars is that they are more likely to use their power with impunity.Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University, said in an interview that although he had seen no reliable data on superstars and sexual harassment per se, evidence showed that organizations tended to tolerate a wide range of misbehavior from people they perceived as stars. \u201cThey seem to also get away with things,\u201d he said, \u201cin a way they would never be able to do if they were not viewed as superstars.\u201d(Fox News brought in a new head of human resources this year who was given responsibility for overhauling and expanding the department and who reports directly to the network\u2019s corporate parent.)The irony is that the calculation that persuades employers to ignore bad behavior by stars is frequently wrong, and not just because of the potential damage to an organization\u2019s image if the bad behavior comes to light.A crucial reason, the study concluded, was that toxic workers tended to drive out other employees, a phenomenon that appeared to have occurred in some recent high-profile cases. Ms. Fowler wrote that when she started working at Uber in November 2015, women made up more than one-quarter of her department. Within 13 months, according to her blog post, the share had fallen below 6 percent, with sexism being a major factor.(The study on the costs of retaining toxic employees relied on data encompassing thousands of customer-support and other front-line service workers, but the evidence suggested that a similar result would apply in many higher-stakes industries, one of the authors, Dylan Minor of Northwestern University, said in an interview.)The growth of a superstar economy is reflected in a greater concentration of money and power among those at the top. A generation or two ago, a top worker who was slightly better than his or her peers tended to receive a moderate premium in earnings. Today, with companies operating on a more sweeping scale, that premium is much higher. Top performers only slightly better than their peers tend to make vastly more money.\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off in the last two decades,\u201d Professor Katz of Harvard said. \u201cYou see it in broad measures of income, and even in the raw data \u2014 the hedge fund manager, finance people, C.E.O. data, top academics, top lawyers.\u201dIn effect, the rest of the economy is becoming more like Hollywood, where a small group of stars have long reaped a huge portion of the rewards. That means more bosses and boards may soon face decisions about whether to stand up to harassers or to overlook their behavior.\u201cTo the extent that technology gives you the power to serve a broader swath of the market, and you\u2019ve got more leverage as a result,\u201d said Robert H. Frank, a Cornell University economist who has written extensively about superstars, \u201cthat\u2019s not slowed down one iota.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Rechnitz in October 2013, it was apparent to Mr. Rechnitz that Mr. Seabrook, for two decades one of the city\u2019s most powerful labor leaders, was a confident, charismatic man accustomed to getting his way.But Mr. Seabrook could also, Mr. Rechnitz learned, be contained. Or, as Mr. Rechnitz wrote in an email to Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s private email address in May 2014: \u201cNorman under control.\u201dIn the second day of his testimony in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz, who is cooperating with the government after pleading guilty to a fraud conspiracy charge, continued to elucidate the control Mr. Seabrook exercised over the city\u2019s more than 10,000 correction officers and their millions of dollars in retirement funds. Mr. Seabrook is accused of steering some of those funds into a high-risk investment fund in return for promised kickbacks; Mr. Rechnitz said he helped negotiate the deal.He bought him crocodile dress shoes and took him on vacations to the Dominican Republic. He introduced him to Murray Huberfeld, a financier in whose hedge fund Mr. Seabrook would eventually invest $20 million of union money, and who is now Mr. Seabrook\u2019s co-defendant.\u201cI told Bill as a favor to him I would get Norman to meet with Bill and be nicer to Ponte,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said. \u201cI got back to him to let him know that Norman was under control.\u201dMr. Seabrook, Mr. Rechnitz said, had told him that he would be less outspoken in the media about his opposition to Mr. Ponte.Mr. Rechnitz said the mayor also called him in 2014 to request a $102,300 donation to help the Democrats retain control of the State Senate.Mr. de Blasio has denied any friendship with Mr. Rechnitz and said he never knew him personally.\u201cIf Jona Rechnitz says he bought the mayor, he is a liar,\u201d Eric Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement Friday. \u201cIf he says he had unfettered access, he is a liar. The only thing Jona Rechnitz can say honestly is that he is a failed fixer of grand delusion just trying to save his own skin.\u201dAlthough Mr. Rechnitz touted his ability to control Mr. Seabrook, he was still taken with the union leader\u2019s influence. He testified that in an effort to impress Mr. Seabrook, he told him lies: that he owned a yacht that he had in reality rented, or that he owned a building for which he was only the manager.He believed that Mr. Seabrook would connect him to Thomas DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller, even emailing Mr. Huberfeld to tell him that he had a meeting set up. (The meeting never took place, Mr. Rechnitz said.) And at dinner at a Manhattan restaurant, Mr. Rechnitz, Mr. Huberfeld and Mr. Seabrook discussed the possibility of Mr. Seabrook running for mayor.Mr. Huberfeld told Mr. Seabrook that he \u201cwould be a great mayor and that we would support him,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz recalled.In March 2014, Mr. Rechnitz paid for himself, his friend Jeremy Reichberg, Mr. Seabrook and Philip Banks III, then the top chief in the New York Police Department, to travel to Israel. Photos introduced by the government showed Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Banks praying together in a temple, or visiting Jerusalem\u2019s Western Wall. In one photo, Mr. Banks is shown giving New York Police Department shields with blessings written in Hebrew to local police officers.At the time, Mr. Rechnitz said, he was working to persuade Mr. Seabrook to invest more of the union\u2019s money into Mr. Huberfeld\u2019s hedge fund. Earlier that month, Mr. Seabrook had secured an initial $10 million investment.By then, Mr. Rechnitz said, not only had he had gathered that Mr. Seabrook had the power to control the union\u2019s funds; he had also realized that Mr. Seabrook was not much interested in the exact formula for calculating his promised kickbacks.\u201cHe didn\u2019t really have the patience\u201d for a detailed explanation of the math, Mr. Rechnitz recalled telling Mr. Huberfeld. \u201cHe just wanted to know: \u2018Bottom line, what do you think I\u2019m making?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Holder-Led Group Challenges Georgia Redistricting, Claiming Racial Bias", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Democratic group led by the former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. has accused the State of Georgia of flouting the Voting Rights Act, claiming that Georgia Republicans reshaped two state legislative districts to minimize the electoral influence of African-American voters.Mr. Holder\u2019s group, the National Redistricting Foundation, is expected to file suit in Federal District Court in Atlanta on Tuesday. The complaint charges that race was the \u201cpredominant factor\u201d in adjusting two districts \u2014 the 105th and 111th \u2014 in the Atlanta area where white lawmakers had faced spirited challenges from black Democrats.Both districts were drawn in 2015, through an unusually timed redistricting law that the lawsuit claims violated the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment.Mr. Holder said Georgia\u2019s district map was a \u201cparticularly egregious\u201d case of racial gerrymandering, aimed at restraining the political clout of Atlanta and its suburbs. With the redistricting measure, Mr. Holder said, Republicans had brought about the \u201csilencing of the state\u2019s approximately three million or so African-American residents.\u201dThe Atlanta area, Mr. Holder said, is \u201cbecoming a lot more competitive, and they, through this mid-cycle redistricting, made the determination that this was something that was threatening to them.\u201dThe lawsuit will also assert that Republicans improperly failed to draw a legislative district in the Atlanta area that would have been likely to elect a black candidate. It asks the court to invalidate the legislative districts and mandate the creation of \u201cat least one additional majority-minority district in the Atlanta metropolitan area.\u201dBoth the Georgia and Wisconsin suits are part of a broader strategy on the part of Democrats to challenge Republican control of the process by which districts are drawn for state and federal elections in many states. After their sweeping victories in the 2010 elections, Republicans redrew legislative maps around the country to shore up their power in Congress and state capitals.As a result, it is now exceedingly difficult for Democrats to bid for control of legislative bodies in a long list of states, including Georgia, even as the voting population in some areas has grown more diverse and potentially more open to Democratic appeals.The Georgia suit will be the first that Mr. Holder\u2019s group, an affiliate of that committee, will have filed on its own, though the group has joined litigation brought by allied organizations in other states.The Georgia map is also being challenged in a separate lawsuit backed by the state N.A.A.C.P.Mr. Holder said the accumulation of court rulings was encouraging to his cause, but he acknowledged that the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to void the Texas map before the 2018 elections was a setback.\u201cI\u2019m obviously disappointed by what the court did there,\u201d Mr. Holder said, noting that lower courts had found blatant racial gerrymandering in effect. \u201cThat system will stay in place, potentially through the next cycle, and I think that\u2019s problematic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Cuomo had then scolded fellow politicians for not acting on major women\u2019s issues like reproductive rights, discrimination, and \u201crespect for women.\u201dMr. Cuomo, who faces a re-election campaign for a third term next year, had said returning campaign donations was a symbolic gesture, but that the overall issue was \u201cbigger than Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\u201cI have three daughters,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure at the end of the day, this world is a safer, better world for my three daughters.\u201dAccording to the Republican National Committee, Mr. Cuomo had been the last Democrat of national stature \u2014 he is a purported contender for the party\u2019s 2020 nomination, an ambition he denies \u2014 to not return or donate all of the money handed out by Mr. Weinstein.And despite Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Smikle\u2019s protestations of a Republican plot, calls to return political contributions from Mr. Weinstein had become a nonpartisan movement: On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, said that \u201cno one in their right mind should be keeping contributions from Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\u201cMy message to everyone who has current accounts with money from Harvey Weinstein is, \u2018Give that money back,\u2019\u201d the mayor added. \u201cGive it to charity.

She added, \u201cWith this anti-Israel bias that\u2019s long documented on the part of Unesco, that needs to come to an end.\u201dWhile the United States withdrew from the group, the Trump administration said it wanted to continue providing American perspective and expertise to Unesco, but as a nonmember observer. The withdrawal goes into effect at the end of 2018, but that decision could be revisited, officials said.If Unesco returns \u201cto a place where they\u2019re truly promoting culture and education on all of that, perhaps we could take another look at this,\u201d Ms. Nauert said.Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization popularly known for its designation of World Heritage sites, is a global development agency with missions that include promoting sex education, literacy, clean water and equality for women.In a lengthy written statement, Irina Bokova, Unesco\u2019s director general, expressed regret at the decision and said that the American people shared the organization\u2019s goals.\u201cUniversality is critical to Unesco\u2019s mission to strengthen international peace and security in the face of hatred and violence, to defend human rights and dignity,\u201d she wrote.Cultural organizations in the United States criticized the decision, saying Unesco played a key role in preserving vital cultural heritage worldwide.\u201cAlthough Unesco may be an imperfect organization, it has been an important leader and steadfast partner in this crucial work,\u201d said Daniel H. Weiss, the president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Ms. Bokova said she had repeatedly told members of Congress that immediate payment of the arrears was not an issue, only American political re-engagement in the organization, which she said she believed served many American interests abroad.Ms. Bokova, in a telephone interview, said she \u201cthought the decision was coming but why now, I don\u2019t know, in the midst of elections\u201d for a new director to succeed her.France and Qatar were running neck-and-neck in the race to lead the cultural body after a third round of voting Wednesday whittled the field to five. Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari of Qatar and Audrey Azoulay of France \u2014 both former culture ministers \u2014 had 18 votes each.Behind them in the secret ballot was an Egyptian career diplomat, Moushira Khattab, with 13 votes, and Tang Qian of China with five, according to results posted on Unesco\u2019s website.Ms. Bokova argued that Unesco is \u201cso relevant to the political agenda of the American government it\u2019s incredible,\u201d citing its work on trying to prevent violent extremism through educational and cultural programs in the developing world. Unesco\u2019s largest literacy program is in Afghanistan, she said, and Unesco is also working in Libya and Iraq to train teachers and preserve cultural heritage in liberated areas. It has always worked against anti-Semitism and to preserve the memory of the Holocaust, Ms. Bokova said.Analysts said that withdrawing from the organization was a significant escalation by the United States in its criticism of United Nations bodies.\u201cThis is another example of the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s profound ambivalence and concern about the way the U.N. is structured and behaves,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator and adviser in Republican and Democratic administrations.In a statement released Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel praised the move by the United States and pledged to withdraw Israel from the organization as well.\u201cThis is a courageous and ethical decision because Unesco has become a theater of the absurd and instead of preserving history, distorts it,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.For President Trump and for Mr. Netanyahu, the recognition of World Heritage sites in the Palestinian territories, like Hebron and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and the 2015 resolution and another in 2016, showed an anti-Israel bias.The 2016 resolution condemned Israel\u2019s \u201cescalating aggressions\u201d regarding a holy site in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount. It was submitted by the Palestinians, was supported by 24 countries, with six opposing it and 26 abstaining.

{"Headline": "Republicans Passed a Budget Bill. What Does That Mean for Tax Overhaul?", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans cleared an early hurdle on Thursday in their attempt to pass a major tax overhaul, after the Senate approved a budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year.The vote sets the stage for what could be a wild ride of tax debate over the next few months, which Republican leaders hope will end with President Trump signing a bill into law by Christmas. The big question is whether their ambitions can survive a winding road of hearings and votes.It will be a difficult task, particularly in the Senate, where Republicans can afford to lose only two votes from their ranks to pass a bill along party lines.Here is a look at the path ahead.House and Senate Republicans have each approved budgets \u2014 but they differ in some big ways, most notably over how much a tax bill would be allowed to increase budget deficits over the next decade.Hashing out those differences could take weeks in a formal conference committee. Republicans want to move faster than that, so they\u2019re signaling that the House may simply take up and pass the Senate version as soon as next week.Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, seemed to suggest as much in a statement after the Senate vote on Thursday. \u201cIn the House, I look forward to swift passage,\u201d she said.Republicans have released a framework for their tax plans, which includes targets for reducing corporate and individual income tax rates, but it leaves major details unspecified. Once the budget is completed, party leaders will move quickly to fill in those blanks, by releasing draft legislation that many lobbyists expect could be as long as 1,000 pages.The House is expected to go first, releasing a bill as soon as the start of November. The Senate could follow soon after with a bill of its own; lobbyists and trade groups expect that bill will differ in some significant ways from the House bill, particularly in the details of international business taxation.Members of the House Ways and Means Committee are huddling next week to debate final, unresolved questions in their bill. Discussions continue among members of the Senate Finance Committee as well. In both cases, Republicans are almost exclusively negotiating with one another, not with Democrats.Once a bill drops, House Ways and Means members will meet for what is called a markup, where representatives offer amendments. Democrats plan to use that opportunity to try to bend the bill more toward cutting taxes for the middle class \u2014 by expanding the earned-income tax credit, for example. Republicans might use the process to try to protect specific constituencies, such as taxpayers in high-tax states who claim large deductions for state and local taxes. Each amendment must be voted on and garner a simple majority of votes to be included in the final bill.If the bill clears committee, the process will repeat on the House floor, and again in the Senate.The bill will be moved under a mechanism known as budget reconciliation, which is important because it allows Republicans to bypass a Democratic filibuster and pass the bill with 50 votes. However, it also forces Republicans to comply with a set of procedural rules that could shape the bill and complicate its passage.The bill will be analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, which will project its effect on federal revenues. To proceed under reconciliation, the bill must not increase deficits by more than the amount allowed in the budget resolution \u2014 $1.5 trillion over 10 years in the current Senate version \u2014 and it must not add to the budget deficit in the next decade.To comply with those rules, Republicans will most likely set some of the tax cuts in their bill to expire after a few years, and they could phase other cuts in over time. They could turn to more drastic measures if those do not prove sufficient, like choosing to rely on a more favorable analysis of their bill, from the White House or elsewhere.In that case, said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former aide to President Barack Obama, \u201cI think you\u2019re talking about taking steps that would be pretty unprecedented.\u201dIf both chambers manage to pass tax bills, they will almost certainly have large differences. Those will either need to be worked out in formal or informal negotiations between the chambers \u2014 unless the House proves willing to pass the Senate bill, unchanged.If and when they find agreements, Republicans would send a bill to President Trump\u2019s desk for his signature.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Some lay prostrate, guiding themselves over foam rollers, while others had their legs wrapped in compression bands or bulky massage boots. There were cryotherapy chambers and a Ping-Pong table. The Ed Sheeran song \u201cShape of You\u201d filled the room.The only indicator that this space was not a trendy boutique gym was the presence of two women sitting pensively in the reception area, as if they were waiting for appointments.Tax experts have their peak season in early April, and physical therapists have theirs, too. In October, distance runners flock to them, seeking last-minute fixes before the New York City Marathon. Some runners need minor adjustments, while others have bodies that are broken almost beyond repair \u2014 even if it takes a licensed professional to get them to face it.At this time of year, 11 Finish Line therapists, most of whom are also distance runners, share the work of seeing an estimate of 400 to 500 injured athletes who are still hoping to run the marathon.\u201cEven up to two days before the race, we have people calling and asking for help when they can\u2019t even run or even really walk a mile,\u201d said Cat Nadeau, a patient outreach coordinator at Finish Line. \u201cWe avoid telling people you can\u2019t do it at all \u2014 so we\u2019ll see them and do what we can to get them to the start line, and also, ideally, the finish line.\u201d\u201cWe try our hardest \u2013 and often it works out \u2013 but I think unfortunately there are some people who have unrealistic expectations about what we can do for them, especially when they\u2019re coming in at the tail end of a serious problem,\u201d said Mr. Ruggiero, who spoke of bodies going into \u201ccomplete shock\u201d from doing too much too soon. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a crystal ball, you can\u2019t promise that the fix is only going to take three sessions,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s six to eight before you can train again. And sometimes you need to defer.\u201dIn one of the treatment rooms at Finish Line, Caroline Varriale, a therapist there for more than four years, was massaging the hamstring of Ben Meaker while she chatted with him about his training.\u201cThis time of year, you\u2019re past the prevention phase in terms of injury, and people put off dealing with their problems; they\u2019re busy and hope it goes away,\u201d Ms. Varriale said. \u201cWhen they\u2019ve been running through pain for a while, it gets harder. Sometimes it\u2019s too late, for this race at least.\u201dMr. Meaker, 32, the owner of a creative agency in Chelsea and triathlete, concentrated as she guided him through a series of exercises that were meant to evoke what she called \u201cneuromuscular activation.\u201d She then dispensed tips on how to stabilize his core. For him, it was not too late.\u201cInjury-wise, I used to have everything in the book, but now I\u2019ve been seeing Caroline on and off for a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI come in as soon as I have any problem and we stop it. It\u2019s just always a balance between training and staying uninjured.\u201dMs. Varriale\u2019s colleague Steve Mitchell, who has coached marathon runners since 2007, explained the mentality of some New York City marathoners that keeps them going, even through excruciating pain, until they finally accept that they need help.\u201cNew Yorkers are inherently tough: If we want to go anywhere, we\u2019re out in the rain and the snow and the heat, and we\u2019re a fit group of people. So of course we love the marathon,\u201d he said. He called the marathon a great outlet for many stressed New Yorkers. \u201cBut you have to watch it,\u201d he warned. \u201cYou can\u2019t let the stress reliever, running, become a new source of stress by going too hard and getting injured. So physical therapy can help alleviate that. Because we all want to be able to do this for a long time.\u201dLuckily for the therapists, other injuries keep them busy when they\u2019re not dealing with marathon season.\u201cI get most of my clients, in finance and a lot of attorneys, because they have injuries from sitting too many hours at a desk every day,\u201d explained Mr. Ruggiero. \u201cI see them all year long.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m proud of the care and education I provide children. But I also want to keep learning and share my knowledge to support parents who are doing their best to raise their children while holding down jobs. While much attention is given to the high cost of child care, what is often forgotten is that early childhood educators find themselves earning poverty wages and are unable to support their own families, much less afford additional education and training that will enable us to better serve the children in our care.When I was a university graduate looking for entry level positions, a recruiter at a Japanese gaming firm recommended me to apply through the disabled section of their careers website. While the website mentioned accessibility benefits, there was only one employment type: Contractor.After a while, I was able to get an offer. However, the employment details were depressing: Salary was equivalent to high school graduates and 65% of peer new grad, on contract subject to annual renewal. Peer non-disabled new grads were accessible to full salary, benefits, and enjoy the status of permanent employment.In the wake of my mother\u2019s death, I have cobbled together several part-time jobs including adjuncting and paid work in public history, but with little security these jobs don\u2019t count for much when you approach a bank for a loan to start a small business, which I\u2019ve also recently done. Women who take time out to care for children face much the same. Not only is caring for the old and the young an unpaid and thankless job \u2014 it has punitive consequences. These jobs need to count \u2014 socially, culturally and economically \u2014 in the labor and financial sectors \u2014 as WORK, which is what they are. Vital and meaningful work, which produces the next generation of laborers and ensures that our sick, disabled and elderly are not thrown to the wolves. If we don\u2019t do it, who will? And yet under capitalism, which commodifies just about everything else, we are expected to do this for free, and then excluded from opportunity when we do.Recognition that things women generally advocate for are not for selfish reasons in the slightest. We want equal pay so we can support ourselves and our families in the same way our male counterparts do. We want decent healthcare so that when an emergency or illness hits us or our family, we can still focus on what needs to be done at work and at home to deal with it, and not wonder how we\u2019re going to pay for it. We want affordable, quality childcare because in order to be successful at work, we need to be able to leave the most important things in our world at a place each day where we know they are loved, and nurtured and educated, and not at a price that makes it senseless for us to work in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low Inflation Could Put Central Bankers\u2019 Superhero Status at Risk", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsSometime between fighting the global financial crisis and averting the breakup of the eurozone, central bankers began to be viewed as superheroes. They are in danger of becoming victims of their own success.Global rate-setters\u2019 omnipotent status has less to do with firefighting and more to do with conquering the soaring inflation of the 1970s and \u201980s. Granted, luck as well as skill had something to do with annual price increases falling toward the 2 percent that most of them target.Globalization and technological advances have been pushing down prices in the past three decades. But central banks received \u2014 and took \u2014 most of the credit for the achievement. In doing so, they also cemented their position as elite technocrats, protected from meddling politicians. But that status is increasingly in doubt. At a Bank of England conference to mark two decades of monetary policy independence last week, participants fretted over the risks posed by unrealistic expectations.First, rate-setters may have built up too much inflation-fighting credibility for their own good, as Christina Romer, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out. Workers will be less apt to push for higher pay if they are convinced any price spikes will prove temporary. That\u2019s a huge problem when inflation is too low, as is the case now in some countries. The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, or his Bank of Japan counterpart, Haruhiko Kuroda, would dearly love wage demands to start the sort of inflationary spiral that their predecessors once feared.Second, there is a risk that political and popular support for central bank independence will fade along with memories of the damage that high inflation inflicted in the past. The more that stable prices are taken for granted, the less that monetary policy makers can expect to be insulated from political attacks when they venture into politically sensitive debates.Take the backlash that Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, faced when he issued prereferendum warnings about the potentially damaging economic consequences of Britain leaving the European Union. Or the acerbic criticism that Gordon Brown, a former British prime minister and finance minister, directed at former United Kingdom central bank officials at last week\u2019s conference for their commenting on fiscal policy. The attack was all the more pointed for being delivered by the architect of the Bank of England\u2019s modern independence.Clashes between politicians and central bankers may become the norm, Charles Goodhart, a professor at the London School of Economics and a former rate setter, told the attendees. Politicians championed central bank independence and inflation targeting during decades when both inflation and government debt as a proportion of gross domestic product were falling. They could well become less supportive in a low-inflation, high-debt era. Though the risk of prices galloping higher appears remote, the impact of higher policy rates on governments\u2019 borrowing costs would be all too real.The breakdown in old economic relationships makes central banks even more vulnerable. Contrary to textbook economic theory, unemployment has been falling without inflation flaring up. Monetary policy makers and other economics experts are hard pressed to explain why. The longer the phenomenon persists, the more doubts will be cast on the necessity and wisdom of continuing to target inflation, either of 2 percent or at all.These questions are all the more likely to surface in an era when inflation is no longer viewed as the main threat to growth or equality. Rate-setters are the first to admit that monetary policy cannot tackle some of the causes of sluggish economic and wage growth, such as low productivity. Faced with restive voters, politicians will inevitably wonder whether fixing these issues wouldn\u2019t be easier if they took back control of policy rates, or gave central banks a different mandate altogether.Another big financial crisis would make demands for an overhaul even harder to resist. The last crisis that started a decade ago forced monetary policy makers to stop focusing too narrowly on just fighting inflation. Some, such as the Bank of England, were officially tasked with supervising banks. Others, including the United States Federal Reserve, expanded the scope of issues they weighed when setting policy, taking into account the potential for bubbles developing in financial markets and asset prices.But financial stability is, as Mr. Carney termed it last week, \u201can orphan child.\u201d There\u2019s little certainty about who is ultimately responsible for maintaining stability, and it\u2019s even harder to judge whether policy makers are doing enough to preserve it. Unlike inflation, there are no simple and permanent benchmarks against which progress toward financial stability can be measured. Its absence is more evident. When things inevitably go wrong, central bankers will take their share of the blame. That, too, could stoke demands for a broader review of central bankers\u2019 task \u2014 and their autonomy.The tenor of the Bank of England\u2019s conference showed policy makers are well aware of such dangers. What they might do to mitigate the risks is less clear. It would help if they could ferret out what is driving inflation and discover whether economies have undergone a structural change that warrants a new approach to policy. Conducting regular reviews of their mandates, say every decade or so, might also make a difference. When superheroes begin to lose their powers, it makes sense to ask for help.Advertisement"}

Gray, an investment manager and former Marine Corps officer, to trek 28 miles through the mountains. The truly motivated would lug 30-pound packs.\u201cWe are here to march for the fallen,\u201d Mr. Gray shouted, describing the next day\u2019s hike as a \u201chaze ex,\u201d Marine jargon for a hazing exercise. He distributed dogtags of troops who had died in battle, ordering that they be worn on the march.In the cult-like world of machine-driven, systematic investing, chasing the latest philosopher king up a mountain counts as just another day at the office.He has attracted an intense following among billionaire investors, pension funds and exchange-traded-fund junkies who reject the old Wall Street way of mutual and hedge fund managers charging steep fees for mediocre returns.That Mr. Gray, who is 37, was once an embedded adviser to the Iraqi Army, works out of a garage in suburban Philadelphia and uses the Marine Corps motto Semper Fi to sign off on emails has only added to his mystique.Since his days studying finance in college, Mr. Gray has been trying to devise computer models that can unearth stock market winners more efficiently than fund managers.The explosion in popularity of exchange traded funds, which track market indexes while trading like a stock on a public exchange, has allowed him to put his theory to the test.\u201cEverything we do is based on how we get rid of the human and how we program instead,\u201d Mr. Gray said.By design, Mr. Gray\u2019s funds are volatile. His algorithms target stocks that appear deeply undervalued or poised for explosive growth. Those are the same types of stocks that tend to be susceptible to violent price movements.The September trek was organized by the Pennsylvania National Guard to honor fallen troops. For the past two years, Mr. Gray has used the event as a venue for like-minded investors to gather in an unconventional setting.At 8 a.m. on the day of the hike, Mr. Gray was among a swarm of about 500 civilians and enlisted personnel pushing up the mountainside. His group included a few clients and a collection of investment advisers and E.T.F. specialists who, beyond their shared interest in high finance, wanted to see if they could keep up with Mr. Gray. There were also several job applicants whom he was judging for mental toughness.Mr. Gray was walking briskly, and he bore his 40-pound pack with ease.He is a compact, wiry man who wears his hair military-style short. He livens up long riffs on efficient markets theory with persistent profanity.In contrast to his interviewer, his conversation was not interrupted by heavy breathing.Growing up on a ranch in Colorado, Mr. Gray had a gift for numbers as well as a desire to serve his country.In 2011, he fielded a phone call from Edward J. Stern, the son of the billionaire investor Leonard Stern. The younger Mr. Stern was responsible for investing the family fortune, and he had grown frustrated with humans as investors, having seen firsthand the losses his fund managers had racked up during the financial crisis. He was taken with Mr. Gray\u2019s musings about building computer models that, in theory, would be cheaper and more efficient than paying high fees to a fallible hedge fund hotshot.\u201cHe opened my eyes to systematic, quant, get-the-human-element-out style of investing,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cIt made a lot of sense to me.\u201dAfter a few years of consulting with Mr. Stern, Mr. Gray persuaded him to seed a fund that would deploy these strategies with $20 million.Today, Mr. Gray\u2019s fund manages just over $700 million on behalf of pension funds and wealthy individuals and families.Mr. Gray still works out of his garage. There are now seven employees, four of whom have military backgrounds \u2014 including a Navy pilot, a combat engineer from the Army and one other Marine.Mr. Gray says that when he hires, the first thing he looks for are people skilled in explaining arcane financial topics to a broader audience, via white papers, podcasts and various forms of social media.So don\u2019t bother asking him how he markets his funds.While he has attracted sophisticated institutions and multimillionaires to invest in his main fund, it remains unclear how successful he will be at persuading smaller (and less knowledgeable) investors to purchase his E.T.F.s.\u201cThey are not for everyone,\u201d said Ben Johnson, an E.T.F. expert at Morningstar and a participant in the march. Indeed, Mr. Johnson said, referring to the volatility of Mr. Gray\u2019s funds, \u201cyou have to be willing to have your face ripped off from time to time.\u201dIn a way, it was that willingness that led 60 middle-aged finance professionals (and one senseless reporter) to march up and down mountains, with heavy packs, in 80-degree heat \u2014 on a Saturday, no less.The hardier among us finished the course in eight hours.That group did not include Mr. Gray. He brought up the rear, cajoling the last of his followers to stumble across the finish line nearly two hours later.A good money manager, after all, never leaves a client behind.A photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified the military branch in which Ryan Sorensen served.

{"Headline": "China Hastens the World Toward an Electric-Car Future", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 There is a powerful reason that automakers worldwide are speeding up their efforts to develop electric vehicles \u2014 and that reason is China.Propelled by vast amounts of government money and visions of dominating next-generation technologies, China has become the world\u2019s biggest supporter of electric cars. That is forcing automakers from Detroit to Yokohama and Seoul to Stuttgart to pick up the pace of transformation or risk being left behind in the world\u2019s largest car market.\u201cWe are seeing ourselves at a crossroads in the development of the automobile industry in this country, with a global scale in mind,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Stackmann, Volkswagen\u2019s top executive for VW brand sales and marketing, during a visit to Shanghai.This, however, would be on a different scale.Already, China is the world\u2019s largest maker and seller of electric cars. Chinese buyers are on track to snap up almost 300,000 of them this year, three times the number expected to be sold in the United States and more than the rest of the world combined.Electric cars are an increasingly common sight in cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. For some drivers here, electric cars are all they know.\u201cI don\u2019t plan to buy a gasoline car, since I heard they are going to be banned for sale,\u201d said Xiong Jianghuai, a lawyer based in Shanghai, who has bought two made by Chery, a Chinese automaker. He said he was delighted that the operating cost was less than one-fifth of the cost of buying gasoline, even if the initial purchase price was a little higher.\u201cI think the future lies in electric cars,\u201d Mr. Xiong said.Chinese auto executives say their country is pursuing common-sense policies to develop cutting-edge industries.Chinese officials have long called for electric cars to be practical, and not just luxuries.\u201cThe central government has made a lot of strategies for the development of new energy vehicles,\u201d said Song Qiuling, a deputy director at China\u2019s Finance Ministry. \u201cThat is why we have seen the progress and development of new energy vehicles.\u201dThe environmental benefits may be tough to realize any time soon. Nearly three-quarters of China\u2019s power comes from coal, which emits more climate-changing gases than oil. Even on electricity, China\u2019s cars are still burning dirty.China is also favoring battery electric technology that it can call its own. Foreign automakers already control much of the advanced technology behind fuel-sipping alternatives such as plug-in hybrids, like the Toyota Prius, which runs on both gasoline power and an electric battery.Still, electric cars make particular sense in China. China\u2019s dense and crowded cities often mean shorter driving distances, while its extensive high-speed rail system reduces the need for long-distance road trips.Han Tao discovered the limits of electric cars the hard way. A 35-year-old stock investor in Beijing, he said he ran out of charge in July while driving to Shenzhen, 1,300 miles away. His Chinese-made BYD E6 electric sedan needed a tow.Still, he said, he and his wife prefer the E6 over the gasoline-powered Chevrolet Cruze they bought four years earlier.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the oily smell and the noise from the engine,\u201d Mr. Han said. \u201cIt accelerates way faster than gasoline cars. It feels like you are on a high-speed train.\u201dWen Jiabao, China\u2019s second-most-powerful official as premier from 2002-12, was an avid supporter of electric cars who came from Tianjin, the center of China\u2019s battery industry. Mr. Wen\u2019s successor as premier, Li Keqiang, has also turned government backing for high-tech industries into his signature accomplishment, while President Xi Jinping has strongly endorsed the effort.\u201cThe development of new energy vehicles,\u201d said Xu Chaoqian, a top aide to Mr. Wan, \u201chas received a lot of support from President Xi, Premier Li and others.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang in Shanghai and Adam Wu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nordstrom Suspends Effort to Go Private Until After the Holidays", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe family behind the 116-year-old Nordstrom retail chain is shelving its efforts to go private until after the holiday season, the company said Monday.The high-end Seattle-based brand, which has 360 stores across North America, is facing the same economic pressures and competition from e-commerce as other brick-and-mortar retailers. Although family members have been tight-lipped about their reasons for wanting to take the company private, such a move would allow Nordstrom more freedom to experiment with solutions while avoiding the scrutiny of public ownership and the pressure of quarterly earnings reports.Nordstrom\u2019s stock sank 5.3 percent Monday to $40.40, down $2.25 a share. The share price is down 22.2 percent from a year ago.The winter shopping season is always volatile \u2014 sales during the quarter can make or break a retailer \u2014 but this year\u2019s performance figures could be especially difficult to forecast given the effect of recent hurricanes, unseasonably warm weather and fast-paced online growth.And potential buyers are more skeptical given that mall-based retailers are in \u201ca space that right now is very broadly out of favor,\u201d said Dylan Carden, an analyst at William Blair.\u201cBanging up against the holiday period, lender appetite starts to wane and we\u2019re starting to see some pretty significant interest rates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get over the goal line.\u201dThe company\u2019s board formed a special committee of directors to review potential proposals from the family group, which includes Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom and Erik B. Nordstrom, who are co-presidents of the company. Other members are James F. Nordstrom, who is the company\u2019s president of stores; Bruce A. Nordstrom, chairman emeritus; and Anne E. Gittinger, a granddaughter of the company\u2019s co-founder.And several major mall-based brands including Gymboree, Rue 21 and Payless ShoeSource declared bankruptcy this year, while Wet Seal was sold. Lenders are skittish as a result.\u201cThe financing market has been difficult given recent bankruptcies,\u201d analysts for KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Nordstrom is relatively strong compared with many of its retail rivals, with a reputation for consistent customer service and steady online sales growth.The company has been experimenting with new store formats, such as the Nordstrom Local concept it opened in Southern California in early October. The 3,000-square-foot store is much smaller than the average 140,000-square-foot Nordstrom unit and operates as more of a showroom than a sales floor.The company has spent a substantial amount on store improvements, expansion and technology upgrades, but the investments have been \u201cwise,\u201d according to Bridget Weishaar, an analyst with Morningstar.In a note to clients on Monday, Ms. Weishaar reiterated an earlier prediction that Nordstrom would add more stores and increase its revenue. The chain, she wrote, is \u201cone of the best operators in the department-store space,\u201d citing its product offering, store count and store locations that \u201cmatch its niche consumer base.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Vows No Poverty in China by 2020. That Could Be Hard.", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHASHAN, China \u2014 From his home in the mountains of northeast China, Li Zhi has watched from a distance as prosperity has transformed China into a land of high-speed trains, billionaires and skyscrapers.But the economic boom that made China rich never came to Chashan, a desolate village of 40 people about a six-hour drive from Beijing. Mr. Li, 72, spends his days limping along dusty roads to collect trash in exchange for tips. Stiff and gaunt, he subsists on a diet of rice, steamed bread and hard liquor.\u201cThe country doesn\u2019t care for me,\u201d Mr. Li said as he rolled a cigarette in his home. \u201cNobody cares for me.\u201dNearly seven decades after the Chinese Communist Party rose to power on a promise of prosperity for all, President Xi Jinping has vowed to fulfill the Communists\u2019 original intent, staking his legacy on an ambitious plan to complete the eradication of rural poverty by 2020.The plan targets the more than 43 million people who still live on the equivalent of less than 95 cents a day, the poverty line set by the Chinese government. Five years ago, about 100 million people lived below that line, according to official statistics.Even as Chinese cities have turned into playgrounds for the nouveau riche and the swelling ranks of the middle class, nearly 500 million people, or about 40 percent of China\u2019s population, live on less than $5.50 per day, according to the World Bank.\u201cThe whole idea of socialism was that all Chinese would have a reasonable living standard,\u201d said Kerry Brown, a China scholar at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe nagging concern is that the Communist Party has created billionaires and a strong middle class, and yet there are still a lot of poor people. That seems to be a massive contradiction.\u201dUnder Mr. Xi, who has played up an image as an Everyman, the fight against poverty has become a national mantra. The state-run news media routinely shows Mr. Xi visiting poor villages, sampling the food and water and checking on the health of residents. The evening news is filled with tales of rejuvenated communities, and villagers-turned-entrepreneurs heaping praise on Mr. Xi and the government for providing loans and new apartments.Now Mr. Xi faces pressure to deliver.\u201cXi Jinping is a prisoner of expectations,\u201d Professor Brown said. \u201cHis problem is not the fears of Chinese people but the hopes of Chinese people.\u201dWhile international organizations like the United Nations and the World Bank have praised the government\u2019s work in helping hundreds of millions of Chinese rise out of poverty in recent decades, some experts worry that Mr. Xi\u2019s plan is more about making headlines than bringing lasting change to poor communities.Some say the government\u2019s focus on 43 million people is too narrow, noting that millions more live just above the official poverty line in conditions that are not much better. Others say that by concentrating on rural areas, Mr. Xi is neglecting the plight of the urban poor, many of whom are rural migrants.\u201cThe government\u2019s initiatives sound good,\u201d said Qin Gao, a professor at Columbia University who studies Chinese social policy. \u201cBut the question is how to sustain poverty reduction. Some people may be looking to quick fixes rather than really addressing poverty.\u201dMr. Xi has instructed officials to focus on alleviating poverty in rural places like Chashan, where farming conditions are poor, access to basic social services is limited and residents struggle with heart disease and other ailments without a clinic nearby.For centuries, Chashan, nestled in the mountains about 6,400 feet above sea level, has been home to farmers who plant wheat and yams and raise pigs and sheep on dry terrain.The government is trying to turn the village into a tourist destination, but so far only a trickle of visitors have come. The town is hard to reach and lacks modern facilities.Many residents said they had virtually no income and that subsidies from the government were inadequate.\u201cThere\u2019s no way out,\u201d said Li Chao, 70, a farmer who has struggled with blood clots in his legs. \u201cI can\u2019t earn any money.\u201dLi Zhi, the trash collector, relies on donations from the few tourists for food and clothing. A calligraphy banner reading \u201cWealth will come\u201d hangs in his home. He said he remains dubious that he will ever be able to buy his own clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to eliminate poverty,\u201d he said.But the hardest work remains ahead. As many as half of the 43 million people who are officially classified as in poverty could be disabled, according to the government. The campaign must also move into areas that have been chronically poor for generations, including many that are home to ethnic minorities.Officials in these areas are resettling villagers near cities in government-provided apartments, sometimes against their will. They are handing out cash subsidies to disabled residents. And they are following Mr. Xi\u2019s call for a \u201ctargeted\u201d approach, tracking the progress of individual residents on giant bulletin boards in town centers.Then there is the fact that Mr. Xi\u2019s campaign is not focused on urban areas. There are more than 200 million rural migrants in China\u2019s cities, where many struggle to receive education, heath care and other benefits because the local government does not consider them residents. Some fall into unemployment or bad health and live in squalid conditions.On a street corner in downtown Beijing, Gu Xin, 63, sat on a flattened cardboard box begging for money. Mr. Gu moved to the city from central China six months ago, only to find himself unable to get steady work after his back was injured in a construction accident.As he bowed to passers-by, a propaganda sign flashed in the background: \u201cWithout the Communist Party, there is no new China.\u201d Mr. Gu said he had no choice but to ask strangers for money so that he could pay medical bills and support his family.\u201cI can\u2019t live here,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to go.\u201dIris Zhao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Protect U.S. Solar Manufacturing, Trade Body Recommends Limits on Imports", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrade officials recommended on Tuesday that the United States impose restrictions on solar power equipment purchased from abroad, including tariffs of up to 35 percent, setting the stage for one of President Trump\u2019s first major trade decisions.The trade case was championed by American solar producers but fought by big buyers of solar panels, like utility companies and home installers, that could be jolted by higher prices if tariffs are imposed.Four officials from the United States International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency that governs trade, announced a range of recommendations Tuesday aimed at protecting domestic makers of solar equipment from unfairly priced imports, especially from China. Those included limiting the imports of certain solar components and imposing tariffs of 10 percent to 35 percent on certain products.Those recommendations will be sent to the president by Nov. 13; he will have 60 days to accept or reject these ideas as he determines the ultimate course of action.The decision comes as Mr. Trump is preparing to travel to China next week to meet with Chinese officials on a range of security and trade issues. Solar may be just one of many industries under discussion, including oil and gas, automobiles and finance.Suniva called the International Trade Commission\u2019s recommendations \u201cdisappointing\u201d in a statement, saying they were not strict enough. It called on Mr. Trump to implement more stringent restrictions \u201cnecessary to save American manufacturing.\u201dThe Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group that has fought any tariffs or barriers to imports, said in a statement Tuesday that the commissioners had taken a thoughtful approach and did not recommend \u201canything close to what the petitioners asked for.\u201d But it emphasized that proposed tariffs would be intensely harmful to the industry.The case is unique because it relies on a rarely used section of federal trade law, known as Section 201 or a \u201cglobal safeguard investigation,\u201d which gives the president broad authority to impose tariffs or other restrictions to help protect a domestic industry.The prospect of such restrictions has set off a fierce backlash from industries and users of solar power, who argue that such measures would raise prices throughout the supply chain and ultimately cost more American jobs than they would save. They argue that cheaper solar products from China have actually been a boon to their businesses and accelerated the adoption of solar energy in the United States, where it now powers millions of American homes and businesses.Workers who install solar power projects, utilities who purchase the power and major commercial users of solar power, like retailers, could all be damaged by such restrictions, said Frank Maisano, a spokesman for the Energy Trade Action Coalition, which represents those groups.\u201cYou can play with the numbers and tweak things, but the bottom line is it\u2019s going to put those groups at risk,\u201d Mr. Maisano said.The case will also be a test of the president\u2019s willingness to impose the kind of powerful trade barriers that he has frequently threatened. Mr. Trump repeatedly talked on the campaign trail about imposing sweeping tariffs on products from China, Mexico and elsewhere, a tough stance that spurred political support among Americans frustrated with the economy.The recommendations announced by the four members of the International Trade Commission ranged significantly in the impact they would have on the industry.The most moderate proposal, made by commissioner Meredith M. Broadbent, would restrict imports of cells, modules and other photovoltaic products to 8.9 gigawatts in the first year \u2014 a level she said was consistent with the level of imports in 2016. That level would increase by 1.4 gigawatts each subsequent year, effectively preventing a surge in imports, but not significantly altering the current market.Ms. Broadbent also recommended auctioning licenses to import these products, and reinvesting the resulting funds in the domestic solar industry.The other three commissioners made far more stringent recommendations. David S. Johanson, vice chairman of the International Trade Commission, and Irving A. Williamson, a commissioner, jointly recommended a 30 percent tariff on imports of solar cells in excess of 1 gigawatt, as well as a 30 percent tariff on modules. Each penalty would be gradually lowered in the next few years.Rhonda K. Schmidtlein, the commission\u2019s chair, recommended a tariff of 10 percent on the first 0.5 gigawatts of cells imported, and a 30 percent tariff on cells exceeding that volume. She also recommended a 35 percent tariff on modules. The barriers would be gradually reduced over the next four years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Is Humming. Bankers Are Cheering. What Could Go Wrong?", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the global economy has been defined by dissonance.There has been the Japanese recession. The financial crises in the United States and Europe. And drama in emerging markets throughout.But as central bankers, finance ministers and money managers descend on Washington this week for the fall meetings of the International Monetary Fund, they will confront an unusual reality: global markets and economies rising in unison.Never mind political turmoil, populist uprisings and threats of nuclear war. From Wall Street to Washington, economists have been upgrading their forecasts for the global economy this year, with the consensus now pointing to an expansion of more than 3 percent \u2014 up noticeably from 2.6 percent in 2016.Economists from the I.M.F. are likely to follow suit when the fund releases its biannual report on the global economy on Tuesday.The rosy numbers are noteworthy. But what\u2019s more startling is that virtually every major developed and emerging economy is growing simultaneously, the first time this has happened in 10 years.\u201cIn terms of positive cycles, it is difficult to find very many precedents here,\u201d said Brian Coulton, the chief economist at Fitch, the debt ratings agency. \u201cIt is the strongest growth we have seen since 2010.\u201dIn Japan, a reform-minded government and aggressive action by the central bank have pushed growth to 1.5 percent \u2014 up from 0.3 percent three years ago.In Europe, strong domestic demand in Germany and robust recoveries in countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy are expected to spur 2.2 percent growth in the eurozone. That would be more than double its average annual growth in the previous five years.Aggressive infrastructure spending by China; bold economic reforms by countries including Brazil, Indonesia and India; and rising commodities prices (helping countries such as Russia) have spurred growth in emerging markets.And in the United States, despite doubts about President Trump\u2019s ability to pass a major tax bill, the economy and financial markets chug along.In fact, one of the few large economies not following an upward path is Britain, whose pending exit from the European Union is taking a toll. Having grown at an average annual pace of just over 2 percent from 2012 to 2016, the British economy is expanding just 1.5 percent this year.Still, the good news may result in some backslapping this week for policy makers and regulators more accustomed in recent years to putting out financial fires than basking in improved economic well-being.\u201cThe meetings will celebrate this period of synchronized economic growth and calm financial markets,\u201d said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser to the fund giant Allianz.Mr. El-Erian, for example, said he was nervous about several possibilities: that global growth could taper off; that prices of stocks, bonds and other financial assets are unsustainably high; and, most important, that markets might not be prepared when central banks reverse their efforts to stimulate economies by keeping interest rates low and buying huge sums of assets.But for the time being, investors, economists and policy officials point to a growing quantity of data that highlight the power of this recent burst of economic growth.A big driver for growth in emerging markets, said Mr. Coulton, the economist at Fitch, has been Chinese imports, which are up more than 10 percent this year. China is the world\u2019s largest consumer of raw materials such as oil, steel and copper, and it is increasingly buying them from emerging economies.Global portfolio managers like Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners, who oversees $9 billion, have been quick to capitalize, snapping up shares of Russian banks and French construction companies.\u201cThe global economy looks pretty darn good,\u201d Mr. Jain said.But with interest rates still historically low, investors have been pushing into even riskier assets, including the bonds of emerging-market economies, to eke out returns.Some countries are taking advantage of the frenzy by issuing more debt. Argentina recently sold so-called century bonds, which don\u2019t come due for 100 years. Jordan and Ukraine issued government bonds that mature in 30 years and 15 years, respectively.Susan Lund, an expert on global financial trends at the McKinsey Global Institute, said these types of investments from global asset managers tended to be longer term \u2014 and thus less destabilizing \u2014 than the so-called hot money from commercial banks that contributed to recent debt crises in the United States and Europe.Are things getting too hot?\u201cWe are in a boom today, but we should not forget that the financial system is still relatively unstable,\u201d said Jim Reid, a credit strategist at Deutsche Bank.Pick your poison: an abrupt slowdown in China, the rise of populism, debt problems in Japan or an ugly outcome to Britain\u2019s move to leave the European Union.His overriding worry, though, is that investors and policy makers aren\u2019t prepared for what will happen when global central banks put a halt to their easy-money policies.Since the 2008 crisis, Mr. Reid noted, central banks have accumulated more than $14 trillion in assets \u2014 an amount that exceeds the annual output of China by $3 trillion.What happens when the central banks all start to sell?\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cAnd no one knows what the outcome will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lost Children of Tuam", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "TUAM, IrelandBehold a child.A slight girl all of 6, she leaves the modest family farm, where the father minds the livestock and the mother keeps a painful secret, and walks out to the main road. Off she goes to primary school, off to the Sisters of Mercy.IRELANDTuamDublinGALWAYHer auburn hair in ringlets, this child named Catherine is bound for Tuam, the ancient County Galway town whose name derives from a Latin term for \u201cburial mound.\u201d It is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese, a proud distinction announced by the skyscraping cathedral that for generations has loomed over factory and field.Two miles into this long-ago Irish morning, the young girl passes through a gantlet of gray formed by high walls along the Dublin Road that seem to thwart sunshine. To her right runs the Parkmore racecourse, where hard-earned shillings are won or lost by a nose. And to her left, the mother and baby home, with glass shards embedded atop its stony enclosure.Behind this forbidding divide, nuns keep watch over unmarried mothers and their children. Sinners and their illegitimate spawn, it is said. The fallen.But young Catherine knows only that the children who live within seem to be a different species altogether: sallow, sickly \u2014 segregated. \u201cHome babies,\u201d they\u2019re called.The girl\u2019s long walk ends at the Mercy school, where tardiness might earn you a smarting whack on the hand. The children from the home are always late to school \u2014 by design, it seems, to keep them from mingling with \u201clegitimate\u201d students. Their oversize hobnail boots beat a frantic rhythm as they hustle to their likely slap at the schoolhouse door.A sensitive child, familiar with the sting of playground taunts, Catherine nevertheless decides to repeat a prank she saw a classmate pull on one of these children. She balls up an empty candy wrapper and presents it to a home baby as if it still contains a sweet, then watches as the little girl\u2019s anticipation melts to sad confusion.Everyone laughs, nearly. This moment will stay with Catherine forever.After classes end, the home babies hurry back down the Dublin Road in two straight lines, boots tap-tap-tapping, and disappear behind those Gothic walls. Sometimes the dark wooden front door is ajar, and on her way home Catherine thrills at the chance of a stolen peek.Beyond those glass-fanged walls lay seven acres of Irish suffering. Buried here somewhere are famine victims who succumbed to starvation and fever a century earlier, when the home was a loathed workhouse for the homeless poor.But they are not alone.Deep in the distant future, Catherine will expose this property\u2019s appalling truths. She will prompt a national reckoning that will leave the people of Ireland asking themselves: Who were we? Who are we?At the moment, though, she is only a child. She is walking home to a father tending to the cattle and a mother guarding a secret, away from the Irish town whose very name conjures the buried dead.In Ireland, the departed stay present.You might still come across old-timers who recall how families in rural stretches would clean the house and set out a drink on the first night of November \u2014 the eve of All Souls\u2019 Day \u2014 in the belief that the dead will return. How it was best to stay in the center of the road when walking at night, so as not to disturb the spirits resting along the wayside.Even today, the Irish say they do death well. Local radio newscasts routinely end with a recitation of death notices. In a country where the culture of Catholicism, if not its practice, still holds sway, this alerts the community to a familiar ritual: the wake at the home, the funeral Mass, the long gathering at the pub, the memorial Mass a month later, and the anniversary Mass every year thereafter.Wry acceptance of mortality lives in the country\u2019s songs, literature, and wit. A standard joke is the Irish marriage proposal: \u201cWould you like to be buried with my people?\u201d A standard song describes a thrown bottle splattering whiskey \u2013 from the Irish for \u201cwater of life\u201d \u2014 over a corpse. Thus the late Tim Finnegan is revived at his wake; see how he rises.Respect for burial grounds runs deep, with crowds gathering in their local cemetery once a year to pray as a priest blesses the dead within. This reverence for the grave may derive from centuries of land dispossession, or passed-on memories of famine corpses in the fields and byways, or simply be linked to a basic desire expressed by the planting of a headstone:To be remembered.Some 60 years have passed since Catherine\u2019s primary school days. It is a gloomy June afternoon, and she is walking the grounds once hidden behind those shard-studded walls. As rain falls from the crow-flecked sky, she drapes her black jacket over her head, almost like a shawl.Her name now is Catherine Corless, n\u00e9e Farrell. At 63, she is a grandmother with a smile not easily given, and any fealty to Catholicism long since lost.True, she occasionally volunteers to paint the weathered statues outside the local country churches: the blue of the Blessed Virgin\u2019s eyes, the bronze in St. Patrick\u2019s beard. But this is for the community, not the church. She finds deeper meaning in her garden, in the birds at the feeder outside her kitchen window, in the earth here at her feet.Few photographs exist of the grim building that once loomed over this corner of Tuam (pronounced Chewm), perhaps because few desired the memory. In its place stand drab rows of subsidized housing and a modest playground. A silvery swing set, a yellow slide, a jungle gym.One day, a few years back, Catherine began to inquire about the old home that had stoked her schoolgirl imagination. She set out on an amateur\u2019s historical quest, but whenever she focused on the children who lived there, so many questions arose about the children who died there \u2014 the ones who never made it to the classroom, or even past infancy.What, then, of Patrick Derrane, who died at five months in 1925, and Mary Carty, at five months in 1960, and all those in between, children said to have been \u201cborn on the other side of the blanket\u201d? The Bridgets and Noras and Michaels and Johns, and so many Marys, so many Patricks, their surnames the common language of Ireland.Would people pause at their graves? Would they be remembered?In asking around, what Catherine heard was:Ah, them poor children. Them poor children.The more she dug, the more a distant time and place was revealed. Now, standing on the sodden grass, she can nearly see and hear all that was. The polished halls and bustling dormitories, the babies\u2019 nappies and nuns\u2019 habits, the shouts, the whimpers, the murmur of prayer.The women and their newborns often arrived after the inquisitive streetlamps of Tuam had dimmed. They came from towns and crossroads with names like snatches of song. Portumna and Peterswell, Claremorris and Lettermore, Moylough and Loughrea.And now they were here at the St. Mary\u2019s Mother and Baby Home, a massive building the color of storm clouds, a way station for 50 single mothers and 125 children born out of wedlock.The government repurposed the building to be among the institutions intended as ports of salvation where disgraced women might be redeemed. These state-financed homes were invariably managed by a Catholic order, in keeping with the hand-in-glove relationship between the dominant church and the fledgling state.Given the misogyny, morality, and economics that informed the public debate of the time \u2014 when a pregnancy out of wedlock could threaten a family\u2019s plans for land inheritance, and even confer dishonor upon a local pastor \u2014 imagine that na\u00efve young woman from the country: impregnated by a man, sometimes a relative, who would assume little of the shame and none of the responsibility. She might flee to England, or pretend that the newborn was a married sister\u2019s \u2014 or be shipped to the dreaded Tuam home, run by a religious order with French roots called the Congregation of Sisters of Bon Secours.Their motto: \u201cGood Help to Those in Need.\u201dYou rose early and went down to the nursery with your infant. Mass at 8, then porridge and tea for breakfast. Breast feeding next, after which you rinsed your child\u2019s diapers before moving on to your daily drudgery. You might polish the dormitory floors with beeswax or clean bedsheets stained with urine.\u201cAn awful lonely ould hole,\u201d recalled Julia Carter Devaney.Born in a workhouse and left in the care of the Bon Secours, Julia became an employee who lived in the home for almost 40 years. Although she died in 1985, her rare insight into this insulated world \u2014 one she described as \u201cunnatural\u201d \u2014 lives on in taped interviews.The gates remained unlocked to accommodate deliveries, but so powerful was the sense of cultural imprisonment that you dared not leave. Save for the chance gift of a cake from the bread man, you starved for love or consolation over the loss of your innocent courting days.\u201cMany a girl shed tears,\u201d Julia said.The Bon Secours sisters who watched your every move were doing the bidding of Irish society. They, too, existed in a repressive patriarchy with few options for women. They might have experienced a spiritual calling as a young girl, or simply desired not to be a farmer\u2019s wife, having seen overworked mothers forever pregnant, forever fretting. A vocation offered education, safety and status, all reflected in clean, freshly pressed habits.And Julia remembered them all.Mother Hortense had a big heart, yet was quick to punish; Mother Martha was more enlightened, but a thump from her could \u201cput you into the middle of next week.\u201d This one hated the mere sight of children, while that one used kindness the way others used the rod. So it went.You preferred instead to suffer at the mother and baby home, bracing for that day when, after a year or so of penitent confinement, you were forced to leave \u2014 almost always without your child. Waiting for that moment of separation, Julia recalled, was \u201clike Our Lady waiting for the Crucifixion.\u201dTypical is the story of one unmarried woman who had been sent to the home from a remote Galway farm. Determined to remain close to her child, she took a job as a cleaner at a nearby hospital and, for several years, she appeared at the home\u2019s door on her day off every week to say the same thing:That\u2019s my son you have in there. I want my son. I want to rear him.No, would come the answer. And the door would close.For the children left behind, there were swings and seesaws and donated Christmas gifts from town, but no grandparents and cousins coming around to coo. They lived amid the absence of affection and the ever-present threat of infectious disease.\u201cLike chickens in a coop,\u201d Julia said.Many survivors have only the sketchiest memories of those days, a haze of bed-wetting and rocking oneself to sleep. One man, now in his 70s, remembers being taken for a walk with other home babies, and the excitement of seeing themselves in the side-view mirrors of parked cars.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even know it was a reflection of ourselves in the mirror,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd we were laughing at ourselves. Laughing.\u201dUntil they were adopted, sent to a training school or boarded out to a family, the older children walked to one of the two primary schools along the Dublin Road, some of them calling out \u201cdaddy\u201d and \u201cmammy\u201d to strangers in the street. Shabby and betraying signs of neglect, they sat at the back of the classroom, apart.\u201cI never remember them really being taught,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cThey were just there.\u201dTeachers threatened to place rowdy students beside the home babies. Parents warned children that if they were bad they\u2019d go right to \u201cthe home.\u201d And even though the babies were baptized as a matter of routine, there remained the hint of sulfur about them.\u201cThey were the children of the Devil,\u201d recalled Kevin O\u2019Dwyer, 67, a retired principal who grew up just yards from the home. \u201cWe learned this in school.\u201dThe man has never forgotten his protector\u2019s name: Mary Curran.One September day in 1961, a rare and ferocious hurricane howled across Ireland, downing power lines, destroying barley fields, battering cottages. As gales flicked away slates from the roof above, Julia helped lock the doors of the mother and baby home for good. Its conditions were poor, some of its staff untrained, and County Galway officials decided not to proceed with a planned renovation.Abandoned, the massive H-block building devolved into an echoing, eerie playscape, where games of hide-and-seek unfolded in dull halls once polished with beeswax. Even the old chapel became a place where children became the priests and confessors. \u201cBless me, Father, for I have sinned. I shot Brother Whatever,\u201d Kevin recalled. \u201cThat kind of thing.\u201dThe years passed. Galway County moved forward with plans to demolish the home and build subsidized housing. And the memories of hobnailed pitter-patter faded, replaced by the faint sounds of children outracing the home baby ghosts that inhabited the property at night.Catherine still wonders what led her to the story of the mother and baby home. Chance, perhaps, or distant memories of the little girl she once teased. Despite her bone-deep modesty, there are even times when she feels chosen.\u201cA troubled soul,\u201d her daughter said.Catherine graduated from secondary school, left a Galway art college for fear of lacking the necessary talent, and found satisfaction as a receptionist. In 1978, she married Aidan Corless, a man as gregarious as she was shy, a fine singer, nimble on the accordion, comfortable on the community theater stage.Four children quickly followed. Before long, Catherine was minding the children of neighbors as well, immersing herself in the homework, play and exuberance of the young.Her mother, Kathleen, died at 80 in 1992, leaving behind so much unsaid. Catherine eventually headed up to Armagh to examine public records that might explain why her mother had been so withholding, so unsettled.As if part of some cosmic riddle, the answer was provided in the absence of one. On her mother\u2019s birth certificate, in the space reserved for the name of the father: nothing.Her mother had been conceived out of wedlock.Other telltale strands to the woman\u2019s early years came to be known: Fostered out, moving from family to family before finding work as a domestic. Then harboring until death a secret she found shameful enough to keep from her husband.\u201cThat she went through her life, that she didn\u2019t like telling us,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cThat she was ashamed to tell us\u2026\u201dIn this patch of pain and regret, a seed was planted.The revelations about her mother fueled in Catherine an interest in understanding the forces that shape who we are and how we behave. While attending a rigorous night course in local history, she learned an invaluable lesson:\u201cIf you don\u2019t find something, you don\u2019t leave it. You ask why it\u2019s not there. You use \u2018why\u2019 a lot.\u201dBurrowing deep into the past, though, provided welcome distraction, and at some point she chose to delve into the subject of the old mother and baby home: its beginnings as a workhouse, its place in Tuam history, the usual. Nothing deep.But there were almost no extant photographs of the home, and most of the locals were reluctant to talk. Every question Catherine raised led to another, the fullness of truth never quite within reach. Why, for example, did one corner of the property feature a well-manicured grotto centered around a statue of the Blessed Virgin?Oh that, a few neighbors said. A while back an older couple created the peaceful space to mark where two local lads once found some bones in a concrete pit. Famine victims, maybe.The story made no sense to Catherine. The famine dead weren\u2019t buried that way.Who were these boys? What did they see?Frannie Hopkins was about 9, Barry Sweeney, about 7. The two were at the fledgling stage of boyhood mischief as they monkeyed around some crab apple trees, all within view of the deserted home that figured in their fertile imagination.Some evenings, Frannie\u2019s father would delay his pint at the Thatch Bar, at the top of the town, until he had watched his son race down the Athenry Road, dodging ghosts from the old home to his left and the cemetery to his right, all the way to the family\u2019s door. But on this autumn day in the early 1970s, the boys were daring in the daylight.Jumping into some overgrowth at the property\u2019s southwest corner, they landed on a concrete slab that echoed in answer. Curious, they pushed aside the lid to reveal a shallow, tank-like space containing a gruesome jumble of skulls and bones.Frannie nudge-bumped Barry, and the younger lad fell in. He started to cry, as any boy would, so Frannie pulled him out and then the two boys were running away, laughing in fun or out of fright. They told everyone they met, prompting Frannie\u2019s father to say he\u2019d get a right kick in the arse if he went back to that spot.County workers soon arrived to level that corner of the property. The police said they were only famine bones. A priest said a prayer. And that was that.In adulthood, Barry Sweeney would go to England to find work, and Frannie Hopkins would travel the world as an Irish soldier. Both would return to Tuam, where their shared story would come up now and then in the pub or on the street.People would tell them they were either mistaken or lying. Barry would become upset that anyone would doubt a story that had so affected him, but Frannie would take pains to reassure him.Now, 40 years later, here was Catherine Corless, amateur historian, trying to unearth that truth, applying what she had learned in her community center research class: Use \u201cwhy\u201d a lot.When her headaches and panic attacks eased, she pored over old newspapers in a blur of microfilm. She spent hours studying historic maps in the special collections department of the library at the national university in Galway City. One day she copied a modern map of Tuam on tracing paper and placed it over a town map from 1890.And there it was, in the cartographic details from another time: A tank for the home\u2019s old septic system sat precisely where the two boys had made their ghastly discovery. It was part of the Victorian-era system\u2019s warren of tunnels and chambers, all of which had been disconnected in the late 1930s.Did this mean, then, that the two lads had stumbled upon the bones of home babies? Buried in an old sewage area?\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand it,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cThe horror of the idea.\u201dActing on instinct, she purchased a random sample from the government of 200 death certificates for children who had died at the home. Then, sitting at the Tuam cemetery\u2019s edge in the van of its caretaker, she checked those death certificates against all the burials recorded by hand in two oversize books.Only two children from the home had been buried in the town graveyard. Both were orphans, both \u201clegitimate.\u201dNeither the Bon Secours order nor the county council could explain the absence of burial records for home babies, although it was suggested that relatives had probably claimed the bodies to bury in their own family plots. Given the ostracizing stigma attached at the time to illegitimacy, Catherine found this absurd.\u201cIs it possible that a large number of those little children were buried in that little plot at the rear of the former Home?\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd if so, why is it not acknowledged as a proper cemetery?\u201dShe also shared her own memories, including that joke she and a classmate had played on two home babies long ago. \u201cI thought it funny at the time how those little girls hungrily grabbed the empty sweet papers, but the memory of it now haunts me,\u201d she wrote.Her daring essay implicitly raised a provocative question: Had Catholic nuns, working in service of the state, buried the bodies of hundreds of children in the septic system?Catherine braced for condemnation from government and clergy \u2014 but none came. It was as if she had written nothing at all.There was a time when Catherine wanted only to have a plaque erected in memory of these forgotten children. But now she felt that she owed them much more. \u201cNo one cared,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my driving force all the time: No one cared.\u201dShe kept digging, eventually paying for another spreadsheet that listed the names, ages, and death dates of all the \u201cillegitimate\u201d children who had died in the home during its 36-year existence.The sobering final tally: 796.Five-month-old Patrick Derrane was the first to die, from gastroenteritis. Weeks later, Mary Blake, less than 4 months old and anemic since birth. A month after that, 3-month-old Matthew Griffin, of meningitis. Then James Murray, fine one moment, dead the next. He was 4 weeks old.In all, seven children died at the mother and baby home in 1925, the year it opened. The holidays were especially tough, with 11-month-old Peter Lally dying of intestinal tuberculosis on Christmas Day, and 1-year-old Julia Hynes dying the next day, St. Stephen\u2019s Day, after a three-month bout of bronchitis.Measles. Influenza. Gastroenteritis. Meningitis. Whooping cough. Tuberculosis. Severe undernourishment, also known as marasmus.Nine home babies died in 1930. Eleven in 1931. Twenty-four in 1932. Thirty-two in 1933.The Tuam home was not alone. Children born out of wedlock during this period were nearly four times more likely to die than \u201clegitimate\u201d children, with those in institutions at particular risk. The reasons may be many \u2014 poor prenatal care, insufficient government funding, little or no training of staff \u2013 but this is certain: It was no secret.Thirty died in the Tuam home that year.In 1938, it was 26. In 1940, 34. In 1944, 40.In 1947, a government health inspector filed a report describing the conditions of infants in the nursery: \u201ca miserable emaciated child\u2026delicate\u2026occasional fits\u2026emaciated and delicate\u2026fragile abscess on hip\u2026not thriving wizened limbs emaciated\u2026pot-bellied emaciated\u2026a very poor baby\u2026\u201dThat year, 52 died.Catherine felt obligated to these children. Continuing to plumb the depths of the past, she eventually cross-checked her spreadsheet of 796 deceased home babies with the burial records of cemeteries throughout counties Galway and Mayo. Not one match.\u201cThey\u2019re not in the main Tuam graveyard where they should have been put initially,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cThey\u2019re not in their mothers\u2019 hometown graveyards. Where are they?\u201dCatherine, of course, already knew.Catherine lives simply, almost monastically. She favors practical clothing, usually black, and has never been one for a night at the pub. She doesn\u2019t drink alcohol or eat meat. Give her a bowl of muesli at the kitchen table and she\u2019ll be grand.Those headaches and anxiety attacks, though, remain a part of her withdrawn life. Aidan, her husband, has become accustomed to attending wakes and weddings by himself. A few years ago, he booked a Mediterranean cruise for two; he traveled alone.\u201cA very quiet, introverted person, wrapped up in her own thoughts,\u201d Aidan said of his wife. \u201cSuffering, if you like.\u201dBut thoughts of the dead children of Tuam pushed Catherine beyond her fears. Believing that the body of even one \u201clegitimate\u201d baby found in a septic tank would have prompted an outcry, she suspected that the silence met by her essay spoke to a reluctance to revisit the painful past \u2014 a past that had consumed her own mother.Now she was angry.Adding to her fury was the knowledge that when a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours closed in 2002, the religious order disinterred the bodies of a dozen nuns and reinterred them in consecrated ground outside the nearby pilgrimage town of Knock.\u201cI feel it at times: that those poor little souls were crying out for recognition, a recognition they never got in their little, short lives,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cIt was a wrong that just had to be righted some way.\u201dSeeing no other option, she contacted a reporter for The Irish Mail on Sunday, a national newspaper. Not long after, in the spring of 2014, a front-page story appeared about a certain seven acres in Tuam.It became the talk of Ireland.All who had been quiet before \u2014 the clerics, politicians and government officials \u2014 now conveyed shock and sadness, while the besieged Bon Secours sisters hired a public relations consultant whose email to a documentarian did little for the religious order\u2019s reputation:\u201cIf you come here, you\u2019ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying \u2018Yeah, a few bones were found \u2014 but this was an area where Famine victims were buried. So?\u2019\u201dThe news from Tuam had shocked many in the country, but the dismissive email reflected the lurking doubts about Catherine\u2019s work. She was, after all, only a housewife.Mary Moriarty was getting her light-blond hair done at a salon in Tuam one day when the beauty-parlor chatter turned to this troublemaker Catherine Corless.Mary, a grandmother well known in town for her advocacy work, would have none of it.She left the salon, introduced herself by telephone to Catherine, and recounted a story that she rarely shared.In 1975, Mary was a young married mother living in one of the new subsidized houses built on the old mother and baby home property. One morning, close to Halloween, a neighbor told her that a boy was running about with a skull on a stick.The boy, Martin, said he had found his prize in the overgrown muck, and there were loads more.What the boy mistook for a plastic toy was actually the skull of a child, with a nearly complete set of teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s not plastic, Martin,\u201d Mary recalled saying. \u201cYou have to put it back where you found it.\u201dMary and a couple of neighbors followed the boy through the weeds and rubble, across the soft wet ground. Suddenly, the earth beneath her feet began to give, and down she fell into some cave or tunnel, with just enough light to illuminate the subterranean scene.As far as she could see were little bundles stacked one on top of another, like packets in a grocery, each about the size of a large soda bottle and wrapped tight in graying cloth.When her friends pulled her up, Mary\u2019s legs were scratched and her mind was on fire. What had she seen? That very morning, she reached out to a person in town who might know. Soon a stout older woman arrived on a bicycle, her faithful dogs trotting by her side.Julia Carter Devaney, who used to work at the home.\u201cAh, yeah, that\u2019s where the little babies is,\u201d Mary recalled her saying as she came to a stop.Julia bent down at the hole and peered in. Mary never forgot what the older woman said next: \u201cMany a little one I carried out in the nighttime.\u201dMary did not know what to make of this. Perhaps these were the bodies of stillborns \u2013 and therefore unbaptized. Stillborns. Yes, that\u2019s what they must be.Eighteen months after falling into the hole, Mary gave birth to her son Kevin at a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours sisters. After breakfast, a nun presented her with her newborn, who was swathed like a little mummy. The young mother\u2019s mind instantly recalled those stacks of graying bundles, and straightaway she unwrapped her precious child.Now, after listening to the woman\u2019s tale, Catherine asked whether Mary would be willing to tell her story on national radio.Of course.The veteran geophysicist guided her mower-like contraption over the thick grass, back and forth across a carefully measured grid. Equipped with ground-penetrating radar, the machine sent radio waves through the topsoil and down into the dark earth.The curious machine was hunting for secrets concealed in the ground of the old mother and baby home, all beneath the gaze of a statue of the Blessed Virgin.The commission\u2019s investigation into the homes \u2014 a network that by the late 1970s was falling into disuse \u2014 is focused on 18 institutions scattered across Ireland: in the capital city of Dublin, and in Counties Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Meath, Tipperary and Westmeath. The high infant mortality rate in some of these facilities was startling. In the Bessborough home in Cork, 478 children died from 1934 to 1953 \u2014 or about one death every two weeks.The investigation\u2019s broad mandate also includes scrutiny of the network\u2019s links to the notorious Magdalen Laundries. The apparent coercion of unmarried mothers to surrender their children for adoption, often to Catholic Americans. The vaccine trials carried out on mother-and-baby-home children for pharmaceutical companies. The use of home-baby remains for anatomical study at medical colleges.It was all part of a church-state arrangement that, decades earlier, a longtime government health inspector named Alice Litster had repeatedly denounced, mostly to silence. This system marginalized defenseless Irish women, she asserted, and turned their unfortunate offspring into \u201cinfant martyrs of convenience, respectability, and fear.\u201dBut laying the blame entirely on the church or the state seemed too simple \u2014 perhaps even too convenient. After all, many of these abandoned children had fathers and grandparents and aunts and uncles.The bitter truth was that the mother and baby homes mirrored the Mother Ireland of the time.While she waited for the commission to complete its work, the woman responsible for this national self-examination, Catherine Corless, returned in a way to those days when her children and the children of neighbors packed the house. Only now the ones gathering about her were in their 60s and 70s, with hair of silver.Home babies.Often lost in the uproar over the many children who died at the Tuam home were the stories of those who had survived. And once Catherine\u2019s research became international news, they began calling and emailing her, seeing in this introverted woman their only hope of trying to find out who their mothers were, who their siblings were \u2014 who they were.Catherine assumed the role of pro bono private detective, following paper trails that often led to some cemetery in England, where many unmarried mothers had gone to start anew. The children they were separated from, she said, needed to hear that their mother had \u201cfared all right.\u201dBefore long, some of these survivors were gathering at the Corless house for a cup of tea and a chat. In their habits and manners of speech, they reminded Catherine of someone close to her who also had been born out of wedlock.\u201cThey all have a kind of low self-esteem,\u201d she said. \u201cThey feel inadequate. They feel a bit inferior to other people. It mirrored, really, the way my mother was.\u201dDuring her research, Catherine had built a detailed, wood-and-clay model of the home, large enough to cover a dining-room table. It had helped her to visualize.Now she and Aidan would occasionally remove the model from a high shelf in the barn out back so that survivors could do the same. They would touch the gray walls and peer into the small windows, as if to imagine themselves in the arms of their mothers.P. J. Haverty, a retired mechanic, sat at the Corless kitchen table one day, sipping tea and eating a ham-and-butter sandwich. He was born in 1951, the son of a 27-year-old woman who had been left at the home by her father when she was eight months pregnant. Eileen was her name, and she seemed to vanish a year after giving birth.The white-haired man remembers only a few snapshot moments of the home. Wetting the bed mattresses that would then be propped against the window to dry. Seeing himself for the first time in a car\u2019s side-view mirror. Walking out the door with his new foster parents, the father choosing him because he looked sturdy for farm work, the mother because he had smiled at her.P. J. was happy enough until his teens, when he was called a \u201cbastard,\u201d and people avoided the pew he sat in, and girls at a dance tittered at the sight of him. \u201cIf the parents found out,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019d tell them to keep away from that lad, you don\u2019t know where he came from.\u201dHe considered drowning himself in the fast-moving river that coursed through his foster father\u2019s field. \u201cThe things that I was called,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought everyone was against me.\u201dThanks to a hint dropped here, a secret whispered there, P. J. managed in adulthood to locate his birth mother in South London. Plump and with graying hair, she reassured him that she hadn\u2019t abandoned him. After leaving the Tuam home, she had taken a cleaning job at a nearby hospital and, for more than five years, returned every week to demand that she be given back her child \u2014 only to be turned away at the door.P. J.\u2019s voice caught as he recalled what his mother, now dead, had said she told the nuns to no avail.\u201cThat\u2019s my son you have in there. I want to rear him. I want to look after him.\u201dIt was true.The ground-penetrating radar and delicate excavation had revealed what appeared to be a decommissioned septic tank. And in 17 of that septic system\u2019s 20 chambers, investigators found many human bones. A small sampling revealed that they were of children, ranging in age from 35 fetal weeks to three years, and all dating from the home\u2019s 36 years of operation.Expressing shock, the commission vowed to continue its investigation into \u201cwho was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.\u201dOnce again, Ireland\u2019s past had returned to haunt.\u201cWe dug deep and we dug deeper still,\u201d he said. \u201cTo bury our compassion, to bury our mercy, to bury our humanity itself.\u201dThough the prime minister said that \u201cno nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children,\u201d others directed their wrath at the Catholic Church and, of course, the Bon Secours order, whose only response so far has been to express its \u201ccontinued cooperation and support\u201d for the commission\u2019s work.The Corless household, meanwhile, became an international newsroom, with family members fielding the constant telephone calls and accommodating the television crews forever at the door. Catherine answered every question out of duty, not vanity. But when Ireland\u2019s most popular television program, \u201cThe Late Late Show,\u201d invited her to appear as a guest, she balked.There was her ever-present anxiety, which now limited her driving to little more than weekly five-mile runs to the SuperValu grocery in Tuam. More than that, she feared being accused of self-aggrandizement at the expense of dead children.Aidan drove her into Galway City to buy an outfit: black pants and a black top, of course, brightened slightly with a silver trim. Then up to Dublin.\u201cI was a mess,\u201d Catherine recalled. \u201cBut I said: \u2018This is it. I have to do it.\u2019\u201d\u201cI\u2019m married to her for 40 years,\u201d he said later, still astonished. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know her at all.\u201dPhotographs of grandchildren adorn the tan walls. A silver kettle rests on the stove. A laptop computer sits open on the counter, beside a window that looks out on a garden, a bird feeder and, beyond, an undulating field of grass.The future of the Tuam grounds that her questioning disturbed has yet to be revealed. The government is grappling with many complexities, including the sad fact that the remains of infants and children, the Marys and Patricks, the Bridgets and Johns, are commingled.One option is to leave everything as is. Another is to disinter the remains for possible identification and proper burial \u2014 although it is unclear whether DNA evidence can be recovered from those who died so young, and so long ago.Other issues also need resolution. Potential compensation for home baby survivors; litigation against the Bon Secours sisters, who run a vast health-care network; the propriety of children playing above the bones of other children.And there remains the maddening mystery of why a Catholic order of nuns would bury these children in such a manner. Was it to save a few pounds for the cost of each burial? Was it meant as a kind of catacombs, in echo of the order\u2019s French roots?The baptism of these children entitled them under canon law to a funeral Mass and burial in consecrated ground. But perhaps the baptismal cleansing of their \u201coriginal sin\u201d was not enough to also wipe away the shameful nature of their conception. Perhaps, having been born out of wedlock in an Ireland of another time, they simply did not matter.Her auburn hair cut short, Catherine stands now at her computer, gazing through the window at the garden that blesses her with a sense of oneness with it all.

{"Headline": "A Madoff Gets a Makeover, by Giving Them", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan, several boutiques \u2014 the kind frequented by women of not just means, but considerable means \u2014 have a stack of thick gold-bordered cards next to the register.They\u2019re as large as cocktail napkins, but they\u2019re business cards: too big to be slipped into a wallet, though perfectly sized to be slipped into a calfskin shoulder bag that costs over $1,000.Ms. Mack recently started a styling business, with a list of clients who are often going through their own dramas. She has a good eye for fashion.She also has something perhaps more valuable: intimate knowledge of loss, grief and starting over, and a determination to be something other than just a footnote in the Madoff saga.She\u2019s not in the market mainly for ball gowns, either. For $200 an hour, with a three-hour minimum, Ms. Mack helps clients choose simple pieces like the best jeans (her own, on this day, were by Mother, worn with a white Hanes T-shirt and black Converse sneakers) and the kicky accessories to go with them. She loves a good beanie. She sits in closets, making notes on Post-its, listening and nodding. Sometimes clients will talk about their recent breakup, or divorce.\u201cThat\u2019s when I\u2019m like, \u2018Listen. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re staring at some girl who has it all because let me tell you what happened to me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mack said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that position, of something bad that\u2019s happened to you, you feel very alone. I felt very alone in my crisis. In my family disaster. You feel like you\u2019re the only person it\u2019s happening to.\u201dWhere Bernard Madoff focused his career on obscuring as much as possible, Ms. Mack\u2019s approach is the opposite.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to hide,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nothing to hide.\u201dUntil December 2008, Ms. Mack\u2019s story read like a spec script for \u201cSex and the City.\u201dThe oldest of two children, she was raised on the Upper East Side, mostly by her mother, a special-education tutor, and her stepfather, a litigator (both now retired). Her father, a management consultant, died when she was 18. Ms. Mack attended the private school Nightingale-Bamford.A blind date with an older, divorced man named Mark Madoff led to a second date, then a third. In 2004, in a Narciso dress of her own, she married him on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. They lived in an apartment in SoHo, a house in Greenwich, Conn., and in another on Nantucket. They added one child to Mark\u2019s two from his previous marriage, and Stephanie was pregnant with another.\u201cWe had a really, really nice life,\u201d Ms. Mack said. \u201cWe had means to have beautiful homes, and do what we want when we wanted.\u201dIn December 2008, the fairy tale took a dark and lurching twist when Bernie Madoff confessed to his sons, Mark and Andrew, that he had spent the better part of his career in finance carrying out a massive Ponzi scheme. His sons, who had worked for their father\u2019s firm for their entire careers, turned him in to authorities, who soon arrested Mr. Madoff.The fraud devastated families, hedge funds and nonprofits from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Europe and beyond.Ms. Mack\u2019s mother and stepfather had investments with Mr. Madoff, as did many of her and Mark\u2019s close friends.Overnight, Ms. Mack had entered a circus of lawyers, F.B.I. agents, paparazzi and tabloid headlines.After considering changing her last name to Morgan she decided on Mack, after ACK, the airport code for Nantucket. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to hear it anymore,\u201d she said, adding that Mark planned to change his name once his lawyers gave the O.K.Her stepfather rushed to the couple\u2019s SoHo apartment, where he found Mark\u2019s body.Ms. Mack said the months after were a blur of heartbreak, anger, financial uncertainty and shame. \u201cI am somebody who cannot stand waiters singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 to me in a restaurant. Can you imagine your life being plastered everywhere?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, your husband taking his own life two years later is shameful. It\u2019s just shameful.\u201dMark\u2019s suicide, many surmised, was an indication of his guilt.She finished a graduate school program at Bank Street College of Education, hoping to work with pediatric patients and their families in hospitals, but found it too much to manage with her two young children.\u201cThat word is a very difficult word to say. To be a widow? You just think of that old lady,\u201d Ms. Mack said. \u201cIt just sounds old and depressing and sad to me. Look, I\u2019m not old-old. I\u2019m not 25, but I\u2019m not old. And I\u2019m not depressing.\u201dShe got the idea to become a stylist over dinner with a friend, after starting to date again, tentatively, in 2012 and realizing that a good outfit was a kind of protection. \u201cSomebody gets set up on a date with me, they can find out everything about me,\u201d Ms. Mack said. \u201cLiterally everything. To become less nervous, I needed to feel like I looked good.\u201dShe contacted several high-end matchmakers and soon found herself working with people who were also seeking romantic relationships in less than ideal circumstances.\u201cI learned very quickly that everyone has a story, and a bad story,\u201d Ms. Mack said. \u201cThe only difference between me and whomever is that mine was public. It\u2019s loss. It\u2019s the same emotion.\u201dHer client base soon expanded beyond the dating world. A cookbook author who needed help putting together an ensemble for a book party. A woman on a very tight budget celebrating her appearance in an Oscar-nominated documentary.Tara Roscioli, a nutritionist, author and entrepreneur, made an appointment to meet Ms. Mack not long ago at Otte, a store on North Moore Street in TriBeCa. The two women arrived early and went through the racks together before heading toward the rear of the store.\u201cI knew she was a single mom. And I knew that she was an author. I didn\u2019t know anything else,\u201d Ms. Roscioli said. \u201cShe\u2019s very real and down-to-earth, and her style and clothes are the same way. She\u2019s a working mom. She gives off a very \u2018real woman\u2019 vibe that resonated with me.\u201dWhen Ms. Roscioli emerged from the fitting room in a long black dress (Ulla Johnson, $750), Ms. Mack suggested adding a leather jacket (Iro, $1,200).\u201cDo you feel comfortable in it? Does it feel special enough? Do you feel amazing?,\u201d she asked, making notes. \u201cThe biggest mistake is putting on something you don\u2019t feel comfortable in.\u201dThe expedition ended with no sale but a hug and promise of another meeting.Veronica Miele Beard, a designer and the co-founder of the fashion line Veronica Beard, has known Ms. Mack since they attended Franklin & Marshall.\u201cShoppers now want an emotional attachment to clothing,\u201d Ms. Beard said. \u201cThey want to feel an emotional reason for buying a piece. Stephanie brings that out. She cares about how clothing makes her clients feel.\u201dWhat about how Ms. Mack feels?The surviving unincarcerated members of the Madoff family spent years split into factions, often not speaking with one another. But that has changed, Ms. Mack said, adding that she is now in regular contact with Ruth and that relations have improved with Mark\u2019s ex-wife. (Both women confirmed this.)\u201cShe is so much fun to be around, and I wish the public could see that side of her,\u201d Ms. Mack said of Ruth. \u201cI\u2019ve urged her to have a comeback. Everyone loves a comeback.\u201dAs for Bernie?\u201cHe\u2019s dead to me.\u201dBy 2016, the apartment in SoHo was sold, as was the house on Nantucket and the house in Greenwich. After Mark\u2019s suicide, Ms. Mack had moved from SoHo to TriBeCa, but she could no longer afford it, she said, and so she crossed the bridge into Brooklyn.Yet, she knows what the public likely still thinks about her \u2014 that, as a Madoff, she was \u201cdripping in diamonds.\u201d That she still is.\u201cThat was never me,\u201d Ms. Mack said. \u201cEven when I was a wealthy Madoff. I didn\u2019t marry Mark Madoff, get a credit card and drop $30,000 in any store I wanted.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t just frivolously go out and spend just tons and tons of money,\u201d she said.Marybeth Gibson, a friend and real-estate agent on Nantucket, said in a phone interview: \u201cStephanie would rather stay home and cook a roast chicken than she would get all dressed up and go out.\u201dMs. Mack wonders, sometimes, what Mark must have been thinking when he made the decision to commit suicide, to abandon her. She thinks Mark didn\u2019t see a life where he wouldn\u2019t be swarmed by photographers. He simply couldn\u2019t imagine a bright future. He thought he \u201cwas toast.\u201dInitially, Ms. Mack changed her last name out of the same fear \u2014 that the Madoff name might forever brand her a pariah. She now knows what she is convinced Mark could not bring himself to see, that infamy can be as fleeting as fame.The scandal that once rocked New York has moved off the front pages of the tabloids. The paparazzi have moved on, circling the apartment buildings of other people. And Ms. Mack has resumed using her married name in her personal life and on her FreshDirect boxes.As her clients try on jeans and dresses and beanies, and they share the trauma of their own loss, Ms. Mack tries to convince them of the same thing she wanted Mark to believe: It won\u2019t always be quite this hard, this raw.\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s not going to get better by Friday. It\u2019s not going to get better in two weeks. It\u2019s going to take time. It\u2019s going to take a lot of time,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m actual living proof.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have what I used to have, but I have more than a lot of the rest of the planet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Expands Affordable Housing, but Results Aren\u2019t Always Visible", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe building is a small part of what Mayor Bill de Blasio has called the most ambitious affordable housing plan in the city\u2019s history. Its eight apartments are counted toward Mr. de Blasio\u2019s goal of preserving or creating 200,000 units of housing in which rents are regulated by 2024.For much of his first term in office, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has made affordable housing a centerpiece of his agenda \u2014 highlighting it in his State of the City addresses and calling it the No. 1 issue on the minds of New Yorkers. In July, he heralded a numeric accomplishment: 77,651 units financed so far.Not everyone is impressed by the numbers. Angry dissent over his rezoning plans has met Mr. de Blasio at recent town halls. And black and Latino religious congregations have a permit for a 5,000-person protest at the gates of City Hall next week to pressure the mayor to build more housing for the poorest New Yorkers.Indeed, the effect of the mayor\u2019s plan on the city\u2019s real estate market has thus far been subtle. The vast majority of these affordable units are existing apartments, not new construction \u2014 a strategy born of design and necessity.Gone are the vast swaths of publicly owned land and blighted or abandoned private apartments that the city took over in the 1970s and \u201980s, and that served as the fuel for Mayor Edward I. Koch\u2019s effort to create more than 150,000 units of affordable housing.The mayor, like his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, is also trying to harness the energy of the private market to compel developers and landlords to keep apartment rents below the market rate for the long term.For the past three years, the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development said, it has used some combination of city money, public incentives and private loans to spur deals with private developers and nonprofits to rehabilitate buildings, build new ones and subsidize apartment rents. In each case, the city imposes a regulatory agreement, and it says it controls who lives in the apartments, based on income in most cases.The bulk of the mayor\u2019s plan is focused on what housing experts call preservation, a designation that could mean, as in the case of at least 7,500 units so far, something as simple as a new financing agreement to keep apartment rent below market levels.Yet City Hall officials could not say how much they were increasing the stock of such rent-regulated and income-tested units because, a mayoral spokeswoman said, they do not track the number of preservation units that they are bringing under city regulation for the first time.\u201cWhen all these advocates run around and say, \u2018Why isn\u2019t the City of New York building housing?\u2019 It doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s no such thing,\u201d said Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and development. \u201cIt\u2019s all about, to what extent can you use the resources of the private sector, and the resources the public sector has, to put together the best deals you can possibly do.\u201dOverall, rents in the city appear to be flattening amid a broad boom in market-rate apartment construction, housing experts observed. But prices are still escalating in some neighborhoods.Those in fast-gentrifying neighborhoods still fear displacement, and many remain skeptical of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plans, opposing individual developments and pushing local officials to beat back rezoning proposals.Only two of the 15 large-scale neighborhood rezonings pledged by the de Blasio administration have been completed amid such resistance. The second rezoning, in Far Rockaway, was approved by the City Council last month. (The rezoning of East Midtown, approved in August, was aimed at spurring commercial real estate development.)Indeed, development backed by the de Blasio administration has been an issue in some elections this year, including a Council race in Central Brooklyn. In that district, opposition has stalled a plan to encourage the creation of a recreation space and affordable housing by allowing condominium development on city-owned land at the Bedford Union Armory.Some nonprofit housing developers and advocates for low-income residents have charged that the administration is improperly focused on meeting numerical goals rather than on creating more apartments for the poorest New Yorkers.\u201cIf under Bloomberg they had offered what they\u2019re offering now, people would have been happy,\u201d said Benjamin Dulchin, the executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a nonprofit. \u201cBut by this point, people are fed up and want real answers. That\u2019s the dilemma they\u2019re in.\u201dThe mayor responded, earlier this year, by adding $1.9 billion in city money to increase the number of units in the plan for households earning less than $40,000. Some in the city\u2019s poorest areas want him to go further.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to push the envelope,\u201d said the Rev. David K. Brawley, who represents an East New York congregation, the St. Paul Community Baptist Church, and has complained about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s affordable housing plan. He is helping to lead the protest next week.Mr. de Blasio has put the total capital cost of the housing plan at $41 billion, almost twice as much as was spent on affordable housing during the Bloomberg administration. That includes public and private funding, with the city\u2019s portion amounting to about a quarter of the total. So far, the de Blasio administration has spent more than $2.2 billion in city money on the housing plan out of about $18.5 billion in total financing.For those who work in the field of affordable housing, the de Blasio approach has been a reasonable one, given the limitations of the times.\u201cFor this city to survive, there is an absolute need for as much affordable housing as can be created,\u201d said Marc Jahr, a top housing development official under Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cWhat makes New York City unique is the immense commitment of city capital to its effort. There is no comparable commitment anywhere in the nation than what this administration or the prior administration have undertaken.\u201dBut projects are scattered and can be found in unexpected places, often hidden in plain sight.Even some of the New Yorkers who had recently moved into these newly constructed apartments were unaware that their homes were part of a scattered but growing archipelago of new buildings supported by city money.\u201cI love this apartment, I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d said Melody Richey, 38, whose first-floor apartment in a rapidly gentrifying section of East Williamsburg gleamed with the crisp edges of new construction. She had no idea the unit \u2014 which she received through a placement by a nonprofit \u2014 had anything to do with Mr. de Blasio or the city. She beamed as she showed off the new appliances, the two bedrooms and a wide bathroom door that could accommodate her wheelchair. Her old apartment, in Flatbush, had an elevator that often broke down.She and her husband, Reginald Spies, said their modest three-bedroom home on Madison Street did not feel affordable to them. The rent had increased steadily \u2014 \u201cevery year, it goes up,\u201d he said \u2014 and at $1,271 was about three times what they said they had once paid in co-op maintenance years before.The building is among those that the city has targeted for preservation, buildings that had been part of a decades-old program intended to create tenant-run cooperatives, like the one Ms. Roberts\u2019s apartment was part of. The cooperative arrangements often ended because the owners fell far behind on their city water and tax payments, leading the city to foreclose and transfer ownership to a third party. In practice, that meant a private or nonprofit developer. There are currently several dozen such cooperatives facing foreclosure by the city, with some tenant-owners actively fighting to keep ownership.The housing plan is more readily apparent under the rumbling No. 3 subway line in East New York, outside of the rezoned area, and in parts of the South Bronx. \u201cHousing New York\u201d banners adorn active construction sites. Residents in new buildings praise their surroundings, which, in bigger buildings, include common spaces for daytime classes with children as well as playgrounds and plate-glass storefronts.Yet not everyone is convinced of the plan\u2019s efficacy.\u201cAt the end of de Blasio\u2019s second term, we\u2019ll ask two questions: Will he have built the 80 percent of the 200,000 units?\u201d said Mr. Dulchin, the housing advocate. \u201cBut the other question is, Will the city be more affordable? And a lot of communities are not convinced of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Vance Jr. as he glided unopposed to a third term as Manhattan\u2019s district attorney. It has been anything but.His decisions not to prosecute Harvey Weinstein and two of Donald Trump\u2019s children, Ivanka and Donald Jr. \u2014 all of whom were represented by lawyers who had contributed to Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign \u2014 have backfired, throwing his office into an unflattering light and forcing Mr. Vance to begin damage control.He has been hit with a torrent of condemnations: The local chapter of the National Organization for Women staged a protest outside his office on Friday, carrying signs saying \u201cWomen Don\u2019t Trust Vance.\u201d Celebrities and commentators have let loose on cable news, Twitter and newspaper opinion pages. And now an underfunded write-in candidate, Peter Gleason, has jumped into the race, offering voters a semblance of a choice.Mr. Vance said \u201cpublic trust in prosecutors requires a leap of faith\u201d that district attorneys make decisions on the merits, without favoring the rich or powerful. Yet, by law, he said, prosecutors often cannot explain their decisions, leading to conjecture that campaign contributions might have tainted them.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked an independent group to help us radically reduce the appearance of influence of money in our work,\u201d he wrote. He added: \u201cI am prepared to dramatically restrict who can donate money to our campaign \u2014 including lawyers \u2014 and the amounts that our contributors are able to give.\u201dMr. Vance has raised roughly $6.1 million for three campaigns, starting in 2009, and some of his most generous donors have been criminal lawyers and law firms who have also represented clients against his office. Such donations are legal under state law, and most of the state\u2019s 62 district attorneys accept them.In New York City, politicians who raise money through the city\u2019s campaign finance system can accept only $400 from individuals with business before the city, and $4,950 from others. But those rules do not apply to the city\u2019s prosecutors, who are county officials. They must comply with much higher limits for state office holders. In Manhattan, that limit is close to $50,000 for the general election.Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign, said a committee of lawyers currently vets donations to make sure they do not come from defendants in criminal matters. Then a senior member of Mr. Vance\u2019s staff conducts a second review for other possible conflicts of interest, including spotting lawyers with pending cases. Since 2009, Mr. Vance has returned 31 contributions for about $134,000, but his campaign has not provided a breakdown.Mr. Vance has said there was not enough evidence in those cases to prove that a crime had been committed. \u201cThere has never been a campaign contribution of any size that has any impact on my decision making on a case,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSome folks, I understand, find that hard to believe.\u201dSeveral defense lawyers said privately they gave to Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign not to influence a specific case, but because it might help them gain access to Mr. Vance or his senior assistants.\u201cThe reason why you donate and show up to their fund-raisers is so you can hopefully be at least recognized and get a meeting if necessary,\u201d said one defense lawyer, requesting anonymity because he still has pending cases in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s standard New York politics.\u201dShane Goldmacher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Eduardo A\u00f1o, said Mr. Ahmad was among 13 militants who died in gun battles that raged late Wednesday and into Thursday morning. Six soldiers were wounded in the fighting, General A\u00f1o said. A mother and her teenage daughter who had been taken hostage were rescued, he said.\u201cOne of the rescued hostages revealed that Mahmud was dead and was buried last night,\u201d the general said.Officials were not immediately available to reconcile the different accounts.In public remarks on Thursday, Mr. Duterte portrayed the Islamic State as an existential threat, and defended his decision in May to declare martial law on Mindanao, the southern island that includes Marawi.He said the police and the military had warned about \u201cretaliation\u201d from the Islamic State in the face of their defeat in Marawi.He said of Mr. Ahmad, \u201cHe was taken this afternoon and that completes the story.\u201dAccording to analysts, Mr. Ahmad had acted as a link to the ISIS central command in Syria, helping funnel money and foreign fighters to local militants trying to seize territory in the Philippines.After their deaths, Mr. Ahmad assumed leadership of about 30 militants still fighting government forces in Marawi.Mr. Ahmad trained at camps run by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in the 1990s while studying at Islamabad Islamic University in Pakistan. He was a former lecturer of Islamic studies at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, one of the country\u2019s top schools.According to Philippine military intelligence, Mr. Ahmad also facilitated the travel of at least four Malaysians to join the Islamic State in the Middle East, including in Syria. He arrived on Mindanao, in the Philippines\u2019 restive south, in 2014, where he sought out Mr. Hapilon and helped plan the Marawi siege and organize local terrorist cells.A video released by the military showed him in a meeting with Mr. Hapilon and Mr. Maute as they meticulously planned the siege, which began on May 23. Mr. Ahmad reportedly funneled 30 million Philippine pesos, or about $580,000, to militants for the attack, according to intelligence officials.Rommel Banlaoi, a terrorism expert who leads the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, said the funds went to help Mr. Hapilon\u2019s group stockpile firearms, weapons and other logistical items for the siege.\u201cMahmud, also called Abu Hanadzalah, was being sought by the Malaysian authorities for ties to global terrorists,\u201d Mr. Banlaoi said. \u201cHe has been identified as a militant recruiter for the I.S.,\u201d he added, using the initials of the Islamic State.He said that among the people Mr. Ahmad had helped to go to the Middle East was Ahmad Tarmimi Maliki, who drove a car packed with bombs into an Iraqi police headquarters, killing 25 people in 2014.While Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Hapilon may have died, there are other militant leaders waiting to emerge, Mr. Banlaoi said.\u201cI.S. may have lost a very valuable conduit in Mindanao with the reported death of Mahmud,\u201d he said. \u201cHis death can severely affect financing terrorism in the region. However, threats of attacks from other terror groups remain imminent. It\u2019s not yet over.\u201dMore than 200,000 residents are crammed into refugee camps, waiting for the military to declare an official end to the operation.The battle in Marawi has been financially draining and has tested the abilities of one of the region\u2019s most poorly equipped armies. After Mr. Hapilon\u2019s death, Mr. Duterte flew there and declared the area \u201cliberated from terrorist influence.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A de facto class system has emerged, saddling a group of have-nots with higher electricity bills that help subsidize the installation of solar panels and wind turbines elsewhere.Germany has spent an estimated 189 billion euros, or about $222 billion, since 2000 on renewable energy subsidies. But emissions have been stuck at roughly 2009 levels, and rose last year, as coal-fired plants fill a void left by Germany\u2019s decision to abandon nuclear power.

It wants a cut of 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels, by 2020, and of 95 percent by 2050.The clean energy movement has deep roots in Germany.Alternative sources of electric power are flourishing in the Allg\u00e4u, a region of rolling pastures, pine forests and domed churches that is home to Ms. Zinnecker\u2019s family-owned farm.In Wildpoldsried, a village of 2,600 a short drive from the farm, around \u20ac40 million has been invested over the years \u2014 much of it by residents \u2014 into an array of renewable power sources and improvements in energy efficiency. The brightly painted, wood-trimmed houses are heated cheaply by generators fueled by methane gas from cow manure, and wind turbines nearly 500 feet tall provide electricity from the hillsides.G\u00fcnter M\u00f6gele, Wildpoldsried\u2019s deputy mayor and energy coordinator, said that the village\u2019s decision in the late 1990s to focus on renewable energy had paid off.Overall, the village generates about seven times as much energy as it consumes, and the surplus is sold to the grid. The income from solar panels on public buildings is fed back into the public purse. It is often doled out to subsidize residents\u2019 shifts to green power, and to reduce fees for the local music club and sports facility.But renewable energy subsidies are financed through electric bills, meaning that Energiewende is a big part of the reason prices for consumers have doubled since 2000.These big increases \u201care absolutely not O.K.,\u201d said Thomas Engelke, team leader for construction and energy at the Federation of German Consumer Organizations, an umbrella organization of consumer groups.The higher prices have had political consequences.The far-right party Alternative for Germany, which won enough support in the recent elections to enter Parliament, has called for an \u201cimmediate exit\u201d from Energiewende. The party, known by its German initials AfD, sees the program as a \u201cburden\u201d on German households, and many supporters have come into its fold in part because of the program\u2019s mounting costs.Julian Hermneuw\u00f6hner is one such voter. Mr. Hermneuw\u00f6hner, a 27-year-old computer science student, said his family paid an additional \u20ac800 a year because of Energiewende.As a clean energy pioneer, Germany has not always seen the results it desired from its heavy spending.For instance, the country has focused on cleaning up electric power generation, with some success. About one-third of German electricity now comes from renewable sources, a fivefold increase since 2000. In the United States, that figure was about 15 percent last year. Britain generates about a quarter of its power from renewables, and France about 19 percent.Advocates of Energiewende charge that Germany is in danger of falling behind rivals like China and the United States in the potentially vast, and fast-growing, business of developing and exporting clean-energy technologies. And without new direction, they say, the country will most likely fail to meet its carbon emissions targets.How the government comes to terms with these problems will be crucial for the sector and for consumers.Germany has already moved to bring subsidies under control. In particular, it has driven down costs by introducing an auction system for new renewables projects \u2014 though it is still on the hook for subsidy payments for the 20-year life of existing projects.A bigger issue may be that Germany has already taken some of the easier steps in its energy transition by making industry more energy efficient and building up renewables.Further progress will require taking on tougher targets. That would mean challenging the politically powerful auto and coal industries, including unions and companies, that have opposed plant shutdowns.\u201cSome of the low-hanging fruit might be gone now,\u201d said Tim Boersma, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cIt is becoming clear how challenging making this overall transition is.\u201dA picture caption on Saturday with an article about challenges facing Germany\u2019s clean energy industry misspelled the surname of a farmer in Betzigau, Germany, who, with his wife, has installed solar panels on his property.

{"Headline": "Should Women Make Their Own Pop Music Canon?", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "The Culture IssueI listened to only female singers all summer. Here\u2019s what I learned.Supported byWe take female musicians just seriously enough not to notice that we don\u2019t actually take them seriously enough. They matter in the present. But posterity is another matter. Posterity is keeping them down in the basement in case Tom Petty comes over.It might also seem counterproductively separatist. Wouldn\u2019t a gendered list like this, in 2017, only reghettoize music that women make? Wouldn\u2019t it argue for its albums as a protected class, not as legitimate works deserving equal standing? Wouldn\u2019t it reinforce the notion that music by women is a genre when, really, it\u2019s a food group?This isn\u2019t just a Rolling Stone problem. Since 1971, The Village Voice\u2019s annual Pazz & Jop music poll has gathered the lists of the country\u2019s music writers and ranked their entries. Most years there have been few women in the Top 40 Pazz & Jop albums. Other rankings, in other publications from Spin and Pitchfork to New Music Express, tell a similar story. So does the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, whose 824 inductees include just 65 women. About 75 percent of the almost 300 Grammy nominees for album of the year have been for albums by men.Christgau didn\u2019t review \u201cA Few Small Repairs,\u201d but here he is on Colvin\u2019s \u201cFat City,\u201d from 1992: \u201cThis ambitious sophomore wins the prize \u2014 the female postfolkie you\u2019re too bored to hate. The digitalized Suzanne Vega is wisely popwise and the bionic Joan Baez positively swangin\u2019 by comparison. Matching strong, undistinguished voice to literate, undistinguished verse, Colvin is like a young Joni Mitchell without swoops or self-invention.\u201dAnd this is from the start of the review by the novelist and critic Stacey D\u2019Erasmo in Rolling Stone: \u201cEver since Joni Mitchell spread her free-verse wings, many a female singer-songwriter has tried to master the introspective idiom only to sink into the swamp of banality or shoot off into some chilly, abstract emotional ozone. But Shawn Colvin stays aloft above her own inner geography by combining a gift for describing fragile, passionate and anxious states of mind with a dense, low, percussive sound that is both rhythmic and muscular.\u201dI won\u2019t say that D\u2019Erasmo\u2019s being a woman attuned her to qualities in Colvin\u2019s music that Christgau, being a man, couldn\u2019t pick up. (I hear everything she did.) But she expresses an understanding of the perilousness of operating within Joni Mitchell\u2019s shadow and an appreciation for Colvin\u2019s elegant evasion of that peril.Even if a separate, distaff canon is built, the atmosphere against which it\u2019s being constructed is, gradually, becoming more integrated. The women behind \u201cTurning the Tables\u201d have been publicly keeping track of albums they omitted, with input from women outside NPR \u2014 open source canonizing. More women and people of color are currently writing about music alongside white men. More diverse music writers might lead to more diverse lists that feature highly ranked work made toward the end of the last century and at the dawn of this one.In the meantime, the culture is shifting. Last month, Jann Wenner put Rolling Stone up for sale. And the album as an artistic product doesn\u2019t have the same commercial currency that it once did. Instagram posts and the like are greatness by alternative measures. This is an era in which fan bases actually might matter as much as a ranking on a list. The canon will evolve. In the meantime, you establish a mechanism by which you can canonize yourself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charges Against Paul Manafort Resonate in Ukraine", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe indictment, unsealed in Washington, on Monday accused Mr. Manafort of laundering $18 million and his associate, Rick W. Gates, an additional $3 million, taking advantage of a tangled skein of offshore companies and American real estate and home improvement deals.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges.Ukrainian prosecutors and courts have not pursued charges against Mr. Manafort. Unless they do that, Mr. Yurchyshyn said, it will not be possible for Ukraine\u2019s government to claim assets in the United States possibly related to money laundered from Ukraine.Money laundering charges require that the financial transactions be designed to conceal that funds came from an unlawful activity, like drug trafficking or official corruption in the country of origin. But no such charges have been filed in Ukraine.Instead, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III accused Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates of disguising the origins of the money to conceal that they had violated another United States law, one requiring Americans to register while lobbying for a foreign government.The federal indictment did not allege that Mr. Manafort had violated Ukrainian law.\u201cWow! That is great,\u201d Andrii Kruglashov, a political consultant who had worked with candidates opposed to Mr. Yanukovych, said of the indictment.\u201cI\u2019m happy that he has been caught, and I\u2019m happy the profile of this case is so high,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, director of the Anticorruption Action Center, a nongovernmental group in Kiev that has investigated offshore companies linked to Mr. Manafort.According to State Department cables written at the American Embassy in Kiev and later released by WikiLeaks, the Party of Regions, with Mr. Manafort\u2019s help, had been \u201cworking to change its image from that of a haven for mobsters into that of a legitimate political party,\u201d the American ambassador at the time, John E. Herbst, wrote. Mr. Yanukovych was elected president in 2010, but driven from office amid widespread protests early in 2014.Handwritten payment records discovered after that revolution suggest that Mr. Manafort was compensated, at least in part, from a party slush fund of off-the-books political contributions, pointing to one possible origin of the money described in the federal indictment.The record book became known as the Black Ledger, and the Ukrainian authorities say all payments described in the book were illegal, but not all have been verified. Two groups of Ukrainian prosecutors have examined the ledger but neither has opened a criminal case in Ukraine against Mr. Manafort, saying there is no proof he actually received the money.Mr. Manafort last visited Ukraine in October or November 2015, his former office manager in Kiev, Konstantin Kilimnik, said in an interview earlier this year. On that trip, he was trying to collect debts from Ukrainian clients, Mr. Kilimnik said.The $18 million Mr. Manafort is accused of laundering comes in sharp contrast to the post-Soviet economic woes afflicting Ukraine, where the average monthly salary is $224, at the current exchange rate.Even if Ukraine cannot recover the money, the indictment sends a message to those still benefiting from corruption in Ukraine, Oksana I. Syroyid, the deputy speaker of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is such a vivid case,\u201d she said. \u201cThe money that they gained through corruption can never be safe in any country.\u201dMr. Yurchyshyn of Transparency International said the American indictment could spur prosecutors in Ukraine to unravel the origin of Mr. Manafort\u2019s money. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope this case will shine light on this side, too,\u201d he said.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Bedlam Out Here in Arizona\u2019 After Jeff Flake Departs Senate Race", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEstablishment Democrats have high hopes for Representative Kyrsten Sinema, a centrist who recently dined in the Blue Room of the White House with President Trump, teaches a bipartisan spin class in the House gym and has broken ranks with her own party on key votes. She was one of only seven House Democrats, for example, who voted to create a select committee to investigate the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.But those impulses toward bipartisanship have soured Arizona progressives against the candidacy of a woman who rose to prominence on a biography that included time as a homeless child and an identity that includes being the first open bisexual in Congress.\u201cThere are issues, murmurs within grass-roots groups and the progressive community, the environmental community and others, including immigration advocates,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona and a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who is withholding his endorsement of her.\u201cIt definitely opens up the Senate for potentially a full spectrum of conservatives to win \u2014 or potentially lose the seat entirely,\u201d said Representative Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican. \u201cThe possibilities are almost endless.\u201dMike Noble, a Republican pollster, called it \u201cbedlam out here in Arizona.\u201d\u201cEveryone\u2019s phones are blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is essentially a free-for-all.\u201dFor Democrats to narrow the Republican hold on the Senate, they will have to take aim at two Republican seats, Mr. Flake\u2019s and Senator Dean Heller\u2019s in Nevada. No other Republican up for re-election next year comes from a generally competitive state.Next year could be different. The challenge for Republican Party officials will be to find a candidate who is aligned closely enough with Mr. Trump to appeal to his populist wing of the party \u2014 and to beat Ms. Ward in a primary dominated by the hard right \u2014 but not so closely that he or she would lose to Ms. Sinema.The party needs \u201can acceptable \u2018not Kelli\u2019 choice who can surf the policy divides that are besieging our party right now,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist in Arizona. He and other strategists say they have been inundated with text messages and phone calls since Mr. Flake\u2019s surprise decision to leave the race.But Steven Law, the chief executive of the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee aligned with Mr. McConnell, vowed that Mr. Bannon and his allies would be the losers.\u201cSenator Flake\u2019s decision to exit the race gives everyone a chance \u2014 the White House and Republicans in Arizona \u2014 to work together to find a strong candidate who can hold this seat,\u201d Mr. Law said in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be Kelli Ward.\u201dArizona House Republicans met privately in Washington on Thursday morning to discuss who might challenge Ms. Ward. At least one potential candidate, Representative David Schweikert, told reporters last week that he lacked \u201cthe burning passion\u201d to run. No consensus was reached on an alternative.Speculation has centered on State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, an early and enthusiastic Trump backer who was the chief operating officer of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign, and Representative Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel and the first American woman to fly in combat.But it is unclear whether Mr. DeWit is interested. And with Mr. McCain battling brain cancer, party operatives say Ms. McSally, who has long expressed a desire to serve in the Senate, may be betting that his seat will open up and that she could ascend to the Senate through appointment by the governor.Ms. McSally has also drawn opposition from a coalition of conservative advocacy groups, led by the Club for Growth. On Friday, the Club for Growth released a letter urging Matt Salmon, a former representative from Arizona, to jump into the race, calling Mr. Salmon \u201ca proven, principled conservative.\u201d Mr. Salmon, who is now the chief lobbyist for Arizona State University, is considering it, a person close to him said.Whoever wins the Republican primary will almost certainly face Ms. Sinema, who is pitching herself to voters as a consensus builder with a compelling life story: She was homeless as a child, and her family lived for a time in an abandoned gas station.In a brief interview while taking a break from fund-raising phone calls, the congresswoman described herself as \u201creally committed to finding a bipartisan solution\u201d to the nation\u2019s problems and said she subscribed to both liberal and conservative values \u2014 a philosophy she said had roots in her childhood.\u201cWe got help from both family and my parents\u2019 church, but we also got help from the government,\u201d she said. Ms. Sinema added that she believed in \u201cthe conservative concept of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and working really hard every day,\u201d and in the liberal notion that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to help people in need.\u201dMs. Sinema, 41, is also the first openly bisexual member of the House and has the strong backing of gay rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, the powerful Washington advocacy organization, which has vowed to make \u201csignificant investments\u201d in Arizona races this year.But some of her positions have rankled party progressives. Besides her Benghazi vote, she voted against Representative Nancy Pelosi of California for Democratic leader.There is \u201cstill a lot of resentment\u201d toward Ms. Sinema over her Benghazi vote, said Representative Grijalva, who added that he would withhold his endorsement until he learned more about how she would vote on issues including tax cuts, immigration and the environment.\u201cGiven how Kyrsten Sinema defines herself in the next few months, she could solidify her position with a real chance to win,\u201d Mr. Grijalva said.Advertisement"}

So why was the overall percentage of books that were written by nonwhite women and released by the major romance publishing imprints, like Avon Romance, at HarperCollins, and Berkley, at Penguin Random House, so low?With its fainting-couch d\u00e9cor, the Ripped Bodice is an informal meeting place for romance readers, writers and publishers who linger at the store as they peruse titles, work on manuscripts and discuss industry trends.Leah and Bea, 25 and 27, decided to compile some data.Eleven of the publishers agreed to provide their lists. For those who didn\u2019t, Bea and Leah set out to create the list of books published and to identify each author\u2019s race.To account for instances in which biographical information on authors was scant or whether they missed titles on publishers\u2019 lists, the sisters appended the study with a 2 percent margin of error.Beverly Jenkins, a prolific author of historical and contemporary romantic suspense, is not surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s indicative of every major industry, regardless of whether it\u2019s publishing, academics, finance or government,\u201d said Ms. Jenkins, who is black, in an interview earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of how America treats people of color.\u201dWhen she was getting her start as an author in the 1980s, Ms. Jenkins said, publishers told her that they did not see a market for historical fiction about or for black people. \u201cThat was proved wrong because I have 37 books in print,\u201d Ms. Jenkins said. Her subjects have included Harriet Tubman\u2019s spy ring.Her latest book, \u201cChasing Down a Dream,\u201d is the eighth book in her women\u2019s fiction series, \u201cBlessings,\u201d about a wealthy woman who saves from financial ruin a town in Kansas founded by freed slaves.Ms. Jenkins\u2019s novels are published by Avon Romance and William Morrow, both of which are imprints of HarperCollins. According to the Ripped Bodice survey, 2.8 percent of the books published in 2016 by Avon Romance were by nonwhite authors. (Avon declined to comment for this article.)It\u2019s tough for any new author to get a first book published, but some people say the bar is even higher for writers who aren\u2019t white.When Sonali Dev, a popular Indian-American romance and women\u2019s fiction author, was shopping her first book to publishers, \u201cThe Bollywood Bride,\u201d \u201cbig-name editors looked me straight in the eye, as if was perfectly normal, and said, \u2018Well, is it possible to change one of the protagonists to white?\u2019\u201d she said.At a book-industry seminar she attended, Ms. Dev says she asked a well-known agent who was sitting on a panel to address the difficulty that nonwhite authors face in trying to sell books that focus on people of different backgrounds.\u201cHe said to me, \u2018You write a \u2018Kite Runner\u2019 and no one can stop you,\u201d referring to the 2003 international best-selling book written by Khaled Hosseini, an Afghan-American first-time author.Ms. Dev replied, \u201cSo every time you get a white story, do you think it has to be \u2018Gone With the Wind\u2019?\u201dShe remains exasperated by the exchange. \u201cHow many authors have their first book as their best book?

{"Headline": "Australia Debates: Does a Warming Planet Really Need More Coal?", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byABBOT POINT, Australia \u2014 In a desolate corner of northeastern Australia, about 100 miles from the nearest town, a grassy stretch of prime grazing land sits above a vein of coal so rich and deep that it could be mined for decades.The Australian government is considering a proposal to build one of the world\u2019s largest coal mines in this remote locale, known as the Galilee Basin, where acacia and eucalyptus trees grow wild between scattered creeks.An Indian conglomerate, the Adani Group, has asked for a taxpayer-financed loan of as much as $800 million to make the enormous project viable, promising to create thousands of jobs in return.Adani has proposed building six open-cut pits and five underground complexes capable of producing as much as 66 million tons of coal a year. New infrastructure to support the mine \u2014 a rail line to the coast and an expanded port \u2014 would also make it economically feasible to extract coal from at least eight additional sites in the Galilee Basin.That could more than double coal output in Australia, which already produces more coal than any other nation except China, the United States and India. About 88 percent of the 487 million tons of coal mined annually in Australia is exported.For many environmentalists, what happens in this mining case is a test of the world\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change. Its failure would register as an unmistakable sign of an international shift away from the fossil fuels behind climate change. But if Australia agrees to subsidize the mine \u2014 even though several commercial banks have shunned it \u2014 the project would demonstrate the lasting allure and influence of the coal industry.\u201cHow it can be constructed \u2014 at a time when the whole world is committed to move away from fossil fuels \u2014 is madness that most people just can\u2019t understand,\u201d said Geoffrey Cousins, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation.The project, known as the Carmichael mine, has provoked strong resistance in part because of its proximity to the Great Barrier Reef, a natural wonder that is already dying because of overheated seawater blamed on climate change. Adani plans to deliver most of the coal to India on shipping routes that critics say would further damage the ecosystem of the world\u2019s greatest system of reefs.A group of Indigenous Australians is also challenging Adani\u2019s claim to the land.But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull supports the project, and it just needs financing to proceed. A government agency established to support private-sector infrastructure investment is reviewing Adani\u2019s loan request, and the company has said it is also lining up money overseas.\u201cThis is a tipping point,\u201d said Maree Dibella, a coordinator of the North Queensland Conservation Council, referring to the mine\u2019s role in the global campaign against coal.Around the Galilee Basin, where a population of less than 20,000 is scattered across an area the size of Britain, opinion is divided.Bruce Currie, a cattle farmer who lives near the site and has traveled to India to investigate Adani\u2019s record, said he is worried the mine will drain too much groundwater, calling it \u201cyet another burden our small business has to bear.\u201dSeveral hours drive north in Collinsville, one of the area\u2019s oldest mining communities, Roderick Macdonald, 57, a retired miner, said Adani had come to the town promising to build mining camps and employ local people.But others in the region are more hopeful. Mining accounts for as much as 7 percent of the Australian economy, and the northeastern state of Queensland, where the Galilee Basin lies, has suffered a downturn in recent years because of slowing demand for natural resources, especially from China.\u201cI need jobs for Queenslanders,\u201d said the state\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of the Adani proposal.Towns along the coast have been vying for potential contracts with the mine for maintenance work, construction and other services. \u201cPeople are really rooting for this because of the economy,\u201d said Stephen Smyth, a local union leader, who started working in underground mines at 17.The Carmichael mine, he added, is \u201coffering that thing of hope, hope for a better life, secure employment and better wages so people can live a reasonable life.\u201dAdani has said the project will create as many as 10,000 jobs in the region. But a consultant hired by Adani said the employment claim was overstated in court testimony given in a case where a conservation group was looking to block the mine. Critics have also noted that other mines in Australia may need to scale back production if Carmichael opens, meaning job losses elsewhere.A host of Australian celebrities \u2014 including the rock band Midnight Oil \u2014 and international groups have urged Mr. Turnbull to kill the project, arguing that such a large mine would violate Australia\u2019s commitment in the Paris climate accord to work to prevent temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.Australia has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, but the coal it sells to India and other countries would not be counted in its total.That has raised questions about the economics of the Carmichael mine. Australia\u2019s four largest banks have publicly ruled out financing it, and analysts have argued that the mine would face stiff competition from local sources of coal in India and elsewhere.Critics worry Adani could default on the government\u2019s loan or flood the market, lowering prices worldwide and allowing coal to make a comeback as an energy source.The Adani Group\u2019s business record has also drawn scrutiny. The conglomerate, whose interests span natural resources, logistics, energy and agriculture, has faced allegations in India of environmental degradation, money laundering and bribery, but it has denied any illegal activity.Adani leased about 460 square miles of land in the Galilee Basin nearly a decade ago. It can take two to three days to get to the site from the coast, with the last leg of the trip on unpaved roads. Surveying, soil testing and design work has begun, including on an airstrip, mining camp, access roads and the rail link, said Ron Watson, a spokesman for Adani Australia.Coal from the mine would be transported by rail about 240 miles through grazing land to Abbot Point, the nation\u2019s most northern deep water coal port, which is already used to ship coal to China, Japan and South Korea. Adani has signed a 99-year lease of the port and plans an expansion that would allow it to double the amount of coal going through.From the air, the piles of coal and equipment at Abbot Point are a striking contrast with the turquoise waters of the Coral Sea. The closest coral of the Great Barrier Reef is just 12 miles away.A 30-minute drive southeast from Abbot Point is the seaside town of Bowen, where parts of the Nicole Kidman epic \u201cAustralia\u201d was filmed a decade ago during better times. Now, the streets are dotted with \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs beyond the main drag.\u201cWe had miners living in the high parts of town,\u201d or the most expensive neighborhoods, said Mike Brunker, who represents Bowen in the Whitsunday regional council and is a supporter of the mine for the jobs it is projected to bring. \u201cThat was the boom time. They had to leave, they had to go to other mines, or they\u2019ve just gone broke.\u201dFurther up the coast is Townsville, home to Adani\u2019s headquarters in Australia, where protesters sometimes congregate and residents exemplify the conflicts felt by many in the region.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for us,\u201d one man snapped at an environmental activist conducting a survey recently.Not too long after, another resident told the activist, \u201cI oppose the mine even though I applied for a job.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of tons of coal mined annually in Australia. It is 487 million tons, not 487.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brutal Killing of Journalist Exposes \u2018Something Darker\u2019 in Malta", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVALLETTA, Malta \u2014 The blast from the bomb planted in the rented Peugeot of Malta\u2019s best-known investigative journalist was so powerful it took police investigators four days to collect body parts and wreckage scattered across sun-baked fields next to the road.Tracking down potential suspects with deep grudges against the victim, Daphne Caruana Galizia, however, will take far longer.\u201cIt is a very long list,\u201d Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, one of the journalist\u2019s many targets, said in an interview. \u201cShe was a very harsh critic of mine.\u201dThe list of people whom Ms. Caruana Galizia offended and infuriated as a prolific journalist in this tiny Mediterranean island nation includes many members of Mr. Muscat\u2019s ruling Labour Party as well as the leader of the center-right opposition. Also on the list: the president of Azerbaijan and his family, executives of a Chinese electrical equipment manufacturer, foreign drug barons, an Iranian-born banker and people active in offshore tax havens like Panama and the British Virgin Islands.All of them were the targets at one time or another of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s relentless probing of the underbelly of the European Union\u2019s smallest country, a nation that boasts Europe\u2019s fastest growing economy but has been hit by six car bombings in the past two years, all of them unsolved.How a country that has in many ways been so successful could be the scene of such a macabre and brutal murder on a picturesque road only a half-hour\u2019s drive from the capital, Valletta, has left many asking what went wrong.In the absence of hard evidence, Maltese are grasping at wild coincidences and conspiracy theories.Mr. Dalli was another regular target of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s writing \u2014 \u201cEverything she wrote about me was a lie,\u201d he said \u2014 and yet another well-connected insider who, despite detailed allegations of corruption, has never been prosecuted in Malta.Mr. Dalli, who in December filed a harassment complaint with the police against Ms. Caruana Galizia, said he \u201cwas very angry\u201d when he heard she had been killed. \u201cIt basically removed my chances of exculpating myself from everything she said about me,\u201d he said.Justin Borg-Barthet, a Maltese legal expert who lectures at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, said the legal system, built up during British colonial rule, has been so steadily eroded by political meddling and constant reshuffling of the police leadership that virtually nobody expects justice to be done in the case of the murdered journalist.\u201cTrust does not function as a reliable constitutional principle when people are untrustworthy,\u201d he said.The bombing stunned Malta, where known criminals sometimes attack one another but where the streets are safe and violence against public figures is extremely rare. It also sent tremors through the European Union, which took in Malta as a member in 2004 and, at a time of deep disillusionment with the \u201cEuropean project\u201d in Britain and elsewhere, has often pointed to Malta\u2019s economic success as an example of how Europe can work.\u201cSuch incidents bring to mind Putin\u2019s Russia, not the European Union,\u201d Sven Giegold, a prominent German member of the European Parliament, said of the killing. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, speaking to fellow European leaders at a summit meeting in Brussels on Thursday, expressed dismay and outrage at the killing.Before Monday\u2019s car bomb, Malta seemed to be enjoying a run of remarkable good luck, often thanks to the misfortune of other countries in the region. A banking crisis in Cyprus in 2013 helped lift Malta\u2019s own financial services industry as the island positioned itself as an alternative haven. (Pilatus Bank, set up in Malta in 2014 by an enigmatic Iranian, who is now a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, to serve wealthy private clients, was a frequent target of Ms. Caruana Galizia.)Malta also benefited from the turmoil unleashed in North Africa after the Arab Spring democracy movement, which prompted many European tourists to choose Maltese beaches over those in Tunisia, its old rival for tourist dollars. Nearly two million tourists visited Malta last year, a country with a population of about 430,000, compared with 1.1 million before the Arab Spring.Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union last year also helped advance Malta\u2019s efforts to promote itself as a safe, low-tax, English-speaking jurisdiction firmly inside the bloc. It has, for example, become Europe\u2019s main hub for online gambling.It has attracted yet more money by selling passports to wealthy foreigners ready to put up more than $1.5 million to buy citizenship. Authorities have refused to name the buyers or disclose their nationalities, but they reported last year that nearly 700 passports had been sold.Ms. Caruana Galizia frequently attacked the passport program as a license for corruption and an open invitation to wealthy and often shady foreigners to make Malta their home, or at least their hideaway.Malta, a British colony until 1964, became such an attractive destination for foreign money that a regional finance minister in Germany recently described it as the \u201cPanama of Europe,\u201d after German tax authorities were leaked the names of 70,000 foreign companies and individuals with holdings there.Since 2013, Malta has surpassed Cyprus as a banking center, relative to the size of its economy, with assets worth more than 500 percent of the island\u2019s gross domestic product, compared with 420 percent in Cyprus, the European Central Bank says.Christian Peregin, the founder of an online news site, Lovin Malta, and an admirer of the dead journalist, said the killing had exposed a reality that Ms. Caruana Galizia had spent decades trying to uncover, a mission that won her a long list of enemies and scores of libel suits.This split has in turn helped shape and harden a deep and often passionate political divide between the Labour Party, which Ms. Caruana Galizia loathed, and the Nationalist Party. She used to support the Nationalists until a new leader, Adrian Delia, took over. She described Mr. Delia as being in cahoots with criminals because of his previous work as a lawyer on behalf of Maltese clients, who she said ran a prostitution racket in London\u2019s Soho district.Mr. Delia was so angered by Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s articles, which included details of a secret offshore bank account he controlled, that he filed four complaints against her for defamation.He dropped the cases after the killing and is now trying to position himself as her defender, demanding that the prime minister, Mr. Muscat, resign and take \u201cpolitical responsibility\u201d for the car bomb.Malta, he said in an interview, is such a small, insular place that whenever villages hold celebrations \u201cthey have two separate feasts or two bands at the same feast,\u201d because half of the village is feuding with the other half for political or other reasons.\u201cWe have to fight not only corruption but our culture of hatred,\u201d he said.Ms. Caruana Galizia, whose family spoke English at home rather than Maltese, played into and helped fan this culture, sneering at rule-bending compatriots as \u201cSicilians\u201d and drawing the hostility of those who viewed her as the haughty representative of an Anglicized elite.Saviour Balzan, a veteran editor and longtime adversary, called her a \u201cspiteful snob\u201d who reveled in ridiculing people she viewed as inferior, particularly those who supported the Labour Party.She stirred such strong feelings that her killing prompted cheers in some quarters. Ramon Mifsud, a police officer whom she had portrayed in her blog as a drunken habitu\u00e9 of bars and lap dancing clubs, celebrated her killing with a post on his Facebook page: \u201cEveryone gets what they deserve, cow dung.\u201d Suspended from the police force, he quickly deleted the message.\u201cShe was certainly the best investigative journalist Malta has ever seen. However, she was at times also a tabloid trash writer, and did not always follow normal journalistic standards,\u201d Ken Mifsud Bonnici, a Maltese legal adviser to the European Commission in Brussels, said, speaking in a personal capacity. Nevertheless, he added: \u201cPeople do not get killed for publishing lies.\u201dThe Maltese news media reported that the bomb that killed Ms. Caruana Galizia was made from Semtex, the plastic explosive that brought down a Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Malta\u2019s previous car bombings involved more easily obtained explosives and targeted known criminals or their associates.The police commissioner, Lawrence Cutajar, the fifth person to hold Malta\u2019s top law enforcement job in just four years, declined at a news conference on Thursday to comment on the kind of explosive used. He was so evasive in his responses to questions that local journalists left the event convinced that the case, like previous car bombings, would never be solved \u2014 despite the presence of investigators from the F.B.I. and the Dutch police.With trust in the police so low, representatives of the island\u2019s main news outlets filed a petition with a court in Valletta demanding that any information found by investigators on Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s phone and computer relating to her sources be kept secret to protect their security.\u201cWhen a leading journalist \u2014 an institution \u2014 is killed and you don\u2019t have any faith in the justice system, everyone becomes a suspect,\u201d Mr. Peregin said. \u201cWe are all scared because we have no idea who killed her.\u201cIt could be anyone she has written about over the last 30 years, or it could be a message to the Maltese press or the government: Watch out for your neck and accept our demands or we will do worse.\u201dMr. Balzan, the managing editor of Malta Today, said that while he was a critic of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s work, he was appalled and frightened by her murder. \u201cWhat happened has taken us back to the Stone Age,\u201d he said. \u201cWho would want to work in journalism after this? Why should I go to work when people are asking: Who will be next?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slavery Thrived on Compromise, John Kelly", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News last night, the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said \u201cthe lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War,\u201d a statement that would shock, among others, the founding fathers. After spirited debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, they included Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph 3 in our Constitution, which said each slave, for legislative representation and taxation purposes, counted as three-fifths of a person. That provision is known as the Three-Fifths Compromise, a term that clearly states that Northerners and Southerners were, in fact, quite able to reach weird compromises on slavery.The Civil War ended slavery, but the legacy of all the prewar compromising on black people\u2019s rights sparked new fights: the fleeting freedoms of Reconstruction; the punishing hand of Jim Crow; the limited triumphs of the civil rights movement; the quiet indignities of practices like racially restrictive covenants, which allowed homeowners to place terminology in property deeds to restrict ownership by race; and redlining, which reduced the value of homes in black neighborhoods compared with their white counterparts.But back to the Civil War. What if slavery itself was always an untenable compromise? What if, in a country that claimed to stand for freedom and justice for all, the idea that people should be kept in chains and forcibly separated from their families and bought and sold and killed was never going to be an idea that sat right with enormous sectors of the population?It\u2019s unnatural to ask us to compromise on whether certain types of people are equal to others, and to expect those deemed unequal not to cry out for justice while being punished, tortured and killed. It\u2019s unnatural to treat people unequally. It requires the construction and maintenance of an economically inefficient system intended to oppress certain types of people. And in this country, it requires us to throw out all the honorable principles this country was founded on. Someone should tell John Kelly that our history is based on too much compromise concerning slavery and black lives, not too little.Advertisement"}

Had no idea he was capable of these horrible actionsFormer President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, also released a statement about Mr. Weinstein, saying that \u201cany man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status.\u201d The Obamas\u2019 older daughter, Malia, was an intern at the Weinstein Company this year.Mr. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was then in charge of Disney\u2019s movie divisions, bought Miramax in 1993 for $80 million. At the time, Miramax was becoming a superpower in the art film business by turning offbeat, inexpensive movies into mainstream hits. It was in 1992, for instance, that Miramax released the micro-budgeted thriller \u201cThe Crying Game,\u201d which collected $62 million at the box office, or $110 million in today\u2019s dollars.In response to the allegations, Mr. Weinstein has acknowledged that his behavior \u201ccaused a lot of pain.\u201d But a spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, also said he \u201cunequivocally denied\u201d any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Disney\u2019s purchase of Miramax included provisions that shielded Miramax from corporate interference.

{"Headline": "The Messy Family Battle for Starrett City", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe buyers of the massive complex, with its 5,581 apartments, schools, shopping center, power plant and even its own ZIP code, pledged to maintain its affordable rents, a key in getting the government approvals the sale will require. They agreed to pay $905 million to its shareholders, who include President Trump.But in recent weeks, a dissident group has emerged to block the sale, putting the Brooklyn development at the center of a bruising grudge match, and leaving its 15,000 residents uncertain about the future of their home, a working-class oasis of 46 towers spread across 145 well-manicured acres on Jamaica Bay.It is a tale worthy of a soap opera, with the widow of the irascible real estate tycoon who built the project locked in a bitter fight with her four estranged stepchildren over the sale.On one side is Carol G. Deane, managing partner of Starrett City Associates and the widow of Disque D. Deane, who put together the partnership that financed the complex and has owned it for more than four decades.Opposing her is a group composed of one of Mr. Deane\u2019s embattled former partners and four of Mr. Deane\u2019s adult children \u2014 Marjorie, Walter, Kathryn and Disque Jr. \u2014 who collectively own only 4.4 percent of the Starrett City partnership. They are backed by a rival real estate partnership \u2014 LIHC Investment Group and Belveron Partners \u2014 that wants to grab the complex for itself, and is willing to pay a slightly higher price.Ms. Deane, Mr. Deane\u2019s third wife, noted in an affidavit that this was not the first time she has tangled with Mr. Deane\u2019s children.Mr. Deane was a shrewd investor who had been a partner at the Lazard Freres investment bank before forming a real estate company. In the early 1970s, he put together the partnership that created Starrett City, an investment that Mr. Trump once described as \u201cprobably the greatest tax shelter ever.\u201dEven in a business known for its hard-nosed tactics, Mr. Deane stood out. He kept a stuffed timber wolf in his office as \u201ca reminder that you should always keep your organization lean and hungry,\u201d and he could be an emotionally remote father, who, according to the author Vicky Ward in her book \u201cThe Liar\u2019s Ball,\u201d \u201csporadically beat\u201d his children with his belt.Mr. Deane died at 89 in 2010, leaving his estate to Carol and their two children. Marjorie and Walter Deane, whose mother, Marjorie Schlesinger, had been Mr. Deane\u2019s second wife until, after more than 30 years of marriage, he divorced her to marry Carol, contested the will. They argued that their father had always vowed to treat all of his children equally, but that after their father\u2019s health declined, Carol asserted control over his finances and cut them off.To make matters even more emotionally fraught, Carol had been a friend and college classmate of Mr. Deane\u2019s daughter Marjorie, who felt betrayed by their affair.Mr. Deane did, however, establish sizable trusts for each of his children, which contained shares in Starrett City.In the current battle, the dissidents contend that Ms. Deane is enriching herself while failing to maximize profits for the shareholders. They say she signed a deal with a single bidder \u2014 the Brooksville Company and Rockpoint Group \u2014 for less than what the Starrett complex, whose name was officially changed several years ago to Spring Creek Towers, is worth, rather than conducting a proper auction.They also make claims of \u201csecret\u201d payments to Ms. Deane and conflicts of interest.LIHC and Belveron, who jointly accumulated a 12 percent stake in Starrett City in recent years, offered $930 million for Starrett City, after Brooksville and Rockpoint had already signed a purchase agreement for the property.They will have a showdown on Wednesday at a hearing in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.\u201cIt\u2019s beyond reason for a sale of this magnitude to forgo some sort of competitive bidding process,\u201d said Kelly Magee, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs. Ms. Magee argued that without an appraisal, it is impossible to know the true market value of the property. \u201cWe believe this kind of closed-door dealing is to the detriment of the many partners who have been part of Starrett City for generations.\u201dMs. Deane and Starrett City Associates have vehemently denied the accusations in court papers and at a recent hearing. They said that nearly three-quarters of the limited partners have already approved the sale to the Brooksville partnership\u201cWe believe the purchasers have provided a fair price and have demonstrated a firm commitment to maintaining long-term affordability and quality of life for our 15,000 residents,\u201d said Bob Liff, a spokesman for Starrett City Associates. \u201cWe will vigorously oppose the lawsuit brought by Belveron to block the sale and attempt to seize control of Starrett City.\u201dIn June, Ms. Deane notified the limited partners that she was exploring a possible sale because of the complex\u2019s need for major capital repairs, a maturing mortgage and for tax reasons. She hired Douglas Harmon of Cushman & Wakefield to market the property.The partnership subsequently remortgaged the property, enabling the partners to reap about $200 million.This time around, Mr. Harmon recommended that the owners skip an auction and instead target prospective buyers who had both the wherewithal to buy the complex and a likelihood of obtaining governmental approval. Ms. Deane was also intent on getting a deal that would preserve Starrett City as an affordable home for low- and moderate-income families.She also wanted to avoid the noisy media coverage that would accompany the sale of a property in which Mr. Trump is a limited partner, fearing it would could scare off prospective buyers. Mr. Trump inherited his 4 percent stake in the development.Mr. Harmon, the broker, met with a limited group of possible buyers.Belveron had also expressed interest in the property, but Ms. Deane said she was wary, knowing that Belveron\u2019s \u201cplaybook was to file lawsuits in an effort to wrest control of large properties from management,\u201d according to her affidavit.Ms. Deane, in her affidavit, said she found Brooksville and Rockpoint\u2019s offer \u201cvery attractive.\u201d As the managing partner, she then sought approval in September from the 76 limited partners in Starrett City, who would share in the residual proceeds.Ms. Deane notified them that the managing partner was entitled to 20 percent of the residual proceeds, or at least $80 million under the current deal.The dissidents have described this as a \u201csecret\u201d provision, but it was an amendment approved by the limited partners in 2003.Immediately after the deal was announced, Belveron offered to buy the property for $25 million more than Brooksville and Rockpoint offered. It also says it wants to preserve Starrett City as affordable housing, though LIHC has clashed with tenants at some Manhattan developments.Rebuffed, Belveron and their allies went to court to stop the sale, claiming that Ms. Deane had ignored a \u201csuperior offer\u201d in breach of her fiduciary duty, after conducting a sale \u201cin a hasty and opaque manner that is rived with conflicts of interest.\u201dThe dissidents\u2019 law firm commissioned their own appraisal earlier this month that pegged the value of the property at almost $1.2 billion, although the assessment was conducted without an \u201cinterior inspection of any of the buildings.\u201dThe pending sale has sent a current of anxiety through Starrett City, where residents worry about the possible effect on the quality of life and long-term affordability of the complex. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, and other elected officials have assured tenants that their concerns will be addressed.Mr. Jeffries said that Brooksville had done a good job so far in communicating with residents. But, he said, any argument that a buyer had not paid enough money would raise suspicions about gentrification and luxury development at some time in the future.\u201cThat\u2019s obviously of great concern,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the Starrett City housing complex. It is 145 acres, not 142.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Prophet of Germany\u2019s New Right", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "FeatureFrom a tiny village in the country\u2019s rural east, a leading nationalist intellectual builds a vision for the future of his movement across Europe.Supported byIt was in April that I first made the journey to Kubitschek\u2019s stronghold. Schnellroda is in a rural part of what was once East Germany, and getting there involved taking a train though a murky river valley past villages dotted with medieval castles, Gothic churches and drab apartment complexes built during the Communist era. As the train chugged farther into the valley, the towns looked increasingly forlorn.Kubitschek was hosting an event called Caf\u00e9 Schnellroda, an open house for people interested in learning about his ideas and publications. I walked through an open door and up a set of wood-plank steps into a timber-beamed loft. A few dozen guests sat at tables, sipping coffee and eating homemade cake. The attendees looked mostly bookish; a few of the younger ones wore the beards and browline glasses favored by the transnational intelligentsia. Kubitschek was immediately recognizable, a towering black-clad figure with a well-trimmed goatee and the upright posture of a military officer. (He once served in an Army reconnaissance unit.) Greeting me with a formal handshake and nod, he invited me to join him at a table in the corner, where he poured himself a small glass of beer and began to describe for me the philosophical underpinnings of his ideology.The human being, he told me as he took a restrained sip, is a \u201cvery difficult type.\u201d It is not in our nature to adhere to some strict political ideology like communism or Nazism, he said; rather, human beings ought to be raised according to their inclinations. \u201cThere\u2019s something the human being can achieve, something he can be. It\u2019s in this direction that he ought to be raised. And we ought never to pull him away from that.\u201d Is this a dark knight or a Montessori schoolteacher, I asked myself, but Kubitschek had already moved on to the topic of Germanness. \u201cThe idea that there is such a thing as a pure German is wholly absurd,\u201d he said \u2014 populations migrate and absorb other influences. Naturally, he said, an immigrant could also become a German, just as long as that person \u201cis willing to give everything for this country and is ready to identify with it.\u201dI asked Kubitschek to define \u201cGermanness\u201d for me. He seemed eager to discuss the subject. Few other people, he said, are so thoroughly preoccupied with the question of who they are: Germany is both Catholic and Lutheran, he said, both Prussian and Bavarian; Germany is the sensitive, cultured nation that produced poets like Goethe and Schiller and the historically militaristic one that produced the Waffen-SS. \u201cGermanness is a fissure,\u201d he said. \u201cGermanness is a question without an answer.\u201dAs Kubitschek nursed his beer at the table, however, he was sounding pretty measured. Before I got around to asking him about his connection to Alternative for Germany, a young girl in a white dress, the daughter of a visitor, approached our table. She had been outside playing with some of Kubitschek\u2019s younger children (he has seven). \u201cMr. Kubitschek!\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the rabbits got out and is running around the garden.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d replied Kubitschek with feigned, playful drama. \u201cThen catch it and put it back in the cage!\u201d\u201cO.K.!\u201d the girl said, hurrying back out.A few minutes later, a young woman quietly informed Kubitschek of another problem. A newborn baby goat was \u201cvery agitated.\u201d Kubitschek, who decries modern man\u2019s disconnectedness from the sources of his food, promptly excused himself and rushed out, returning a few minutes later to explain that his newborn goats sometimes have trouble digesting their mother\u2019s milk. He rubbed the distressed newborn\u2019s belly, he said, and it passed a stool. All was well at the manor again.Kubitschek\u2019s views are reaching a growing audience. Despite the unique cultural taboos arising from the historical memory of Nazism, Germany has joined a long list of European countries \u2014 Austria, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia among them \u2014 where far-right, sometimes explicitly racist political parties command significant minorities in national elections. This ethno-nationalist renaissance presents an odd paradox. European nationalists who at one time might have gone to war with one another now promote a kind of New Right rainbow coalition, in which sovereign states steadfastly maintain their ethnic and cultural identities in service of some larger \u201cWestern\u201d ideal. This \u201cethno-pluralism,\u201d as New Right activists call it, is not based on Western liberal notions of equality or the primacy of individual rights but in opposition to other cultures, usually nonwhite, that they say are threatening to overtake Europe and, indeed, the entire Western world by means of immigration. The threat to the West is also often cast in vague cultural terms as a kind of internal decay. When President Trump visited Poland, he argued in a speech that the United States and Europe were engaged in a common cultural battle. \u201cThe fundamental question of our time,\u201d he said, \u201cis whether the West has the will to survive.\u201dThe German New Right portrays itself as the contemporary reincarnation of the Conservative Revolution. Kubitschek regularly echoed Spengler in our conversations and on more than one occasion told me that Germany was a \u201ctired\u201d nation in its twilight years. The New Right\u2019s efforts to reclaim this dated political and intellectual movement serve a purpose. Despite their unmistakable ideological overlap with the National Socialists, many Conservative Revolutionaries were ambivalent toward them and rejected Hitler as a proletarian brute. That apparent distance provides New Right thinkers not just with a nationalist, antiparliamentary tradition rooted in German history but also with a useful argument: National Socialism is a deviation from their chosen ideology, not its inevitable conclusion.After World War II, Armin Mohler, a Swiss-born writer who had tried unsuccessfully to join the Waffen-SS, took on the project of disentangling the Conservative Revolutionary ideology from Nazism. Mohler, a self-described fascist who had an early and profound influence on Kubitschek, sought to create a more palatable tradition for the postwar era, and he is considered the father of the German New Right. Until recently, though, New Right thinking mostly remained on the fringes of German society, lacking grass-roots expression or a viable manifestation in party politics. But the German political climate changed in 2015, when Angela Merkel allowed nearly a million refugees and migrants to enter the country over the Bavarian border. While many Germans celebrated their arrival, others were angered, feeling that their worries about \u201cIslamization,\u201d criminality and the erosion of German identity were being ignored by the political establishment. For New Right activists, that anger is good. It is the ineradicable opposition that will bring about the political transformation they seek.But the German New Right has other influences as well. Nils Wegner, a young writer who translates English-language books into German for Kubitschek\u2019s publishing house, follows the American alt-right scene with great interest \u2014 listening, for example, to podcasts by Richard Spencer, the white-supremacist leader who once declared before a crowd of acolytes: \u201cHail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\u201d Wegner told me that the American idea of a \u201cracially defined ethno-state\u201d would \u201ccome across as pretty weird over here,\u201d because Europeans are not comfortable putting identity matters in racial terms. I asked him if this discomfort was substantive or merely semantic, and his answer was surprisingly forthright. \u201cI would say that the main difference is the semantic difference,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the modus operandi is not really the same.\u201d Unlike alt-right activists in the United States, he went on to explain, activists on the European New Right tend to avoid appearing alongside \u201corthodox\u201d right groups \u2014 neo-Nazis \u2014 because \u201cthe look\u201d would impede their effort to appear as a \u201cnew kind of postmodern\u201d patriotic movement.Wegner said another difference was a matter of intensity. The Americans, he said, see their country as collapsing, and therefore they advocate revolutionary action \u2014 the creation of a white ethno-state in the Pacific Northwest, for example. European New Right activists don\u2019t see their circumstances as that dire, he continued. They would be content with a \u201croll back\u201d on immigration.\u201cIt\u2019s not yet a revolutionary situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old structures are to be kept intact.\u201dHe now speaks of the former West Germany in derisive terms. He sees \u201cWessis\u201d \u2014 the people who live there \u2014 as having been indoctrinated into a form of hyper-moralistic mass thinking. Its cities, he believes, are \u201clost\u201d to immigrants. His wife, Ellen Kositza, who writes polemics against what she calls \u201chyper-feminism,\u201d also hails from the West \u2014 from a working-class city near Frankfurt that, she said, has become almost completely \u201cforeignized.\u201d The former East Germany, where they\u2019ve made their new home, has experienced comparatively less immigration; it\u2019s the place where, as Kubitschek put it, \u201cGermany is still Germany.\u201dKubitschek told me his political awakening came in high school, when a group of classmates put together a presentation about the Nazi period in their state. Kubitschek loathed the presentation, he said, because it unjustly placed guilt for the Nazi crimes on his grandparents\u2019 entire generation. Kubitschek, who was an editor at the school newspaper, wrote an article criticizing the presentation, and it set off a community debate. The younger teachers, products of 1960s counterculture, took the side of the students who put on the presentation. The older teachers, including the rector, who helped operate an antiaircraft gun in the war, sided with him. One sympathetic teacher suggested that Kubitschek read the work of the historian Ernst Nolte, known for a controversial essay he wrote around that time titled \u201cThe Past That Won\u2019t Go Away.\u201d Nolte portrayed Nazism as a reaction to the \u201cexistential threat\u201d posed by Bolshevism and suggested Bolshevik \u201cclass murder\u201d was comparable to the Holocaust, calling it the \u201clogical and factual predecessor to the Nazi \u2018racial murder.\u2019\u2009\u201d Nolte\u2019s revisionism sparked a divisive debate in Germany known as the \u201chistorians\u2019 dispute,\u201d and though Nolte was denounced as a Hitler apologist, several conservative German historians and journalists supported him. For Kubitschek, Nolte\u2019s work has been a lifelong influence.After high school, Kubitschek joined the German Army, becoming part of a special reconnaissance unit, and later joined the reserves. His company was \u201cvery right,\u201d he said. It drew from an \u201cunbroken historical tradition\u201d that reached back at least as far as the Brandenburgers, a Nazi covert-intelligence unit, and symbols like the \u201cswastika and so on\u201d hung on the company walls. Several of the men I met in Kubitschek\u2019s circle also served in the military; in postwar pacifist Germany, one of them told me, it is attractive to a lot of rightists who saw German demilitarization as an emasculating development. In 2001, Kubitschek himself was discharged from the reserves for \u201cright-wing-extremist endeavors,\u201d but the decision was later revoked after supporters petitioned the Army.The resolution, which set into motion Lucke\u2019s downfall as party leader, read like something Kubitschek could have written. In fact, Kubitschek told me, he drafted it in his library in Schnellroda. What Lucke had failed to grasp, Kubitschek said, was the degree to which Alternative for Germany represented an emotional \u201coutbreak\u201d that went way beyond the economist Lucke\u2019s \u201ctechnocratic dissatisfaction\u201d with the euro.I asked him then what was left for him to do. Despair?I was half joking, but he nodded in all seriousness.\u201cYou\u2019re desperate?\u201d I asked.\u201cYes,\u201d he said.What, I asked, does political victory look like for a movement of despair?The best that could be done, he said, was \u201cto prevent the worst.\u201dThe rally took place in a central square near an unostentatious memorial marking the spot where thousands of corpses were burned after the 1945 Allied bombing that destroyed the city. Before the event began, I found a group of demonstrators \u2014 mostly men and women of retirement age \u2014 huddled around an accordion player. They were singing folk songs like \u201cHoly Fatherland,\u201d a tune once favored by the Hitler Youth. \u201cIn dangerous times, your sons cluster around you. Surrounded by danger, Fatherland, we all stand hand in hand.\u201d One silver-haired man who placed a bellowing emphasis on the word \u201cFatherland\u201d every time it came up handed me a lyric sheet so I could follow along. I asked him what kind of songs they were.\u201cForbidden songs!\u201d he said, almost hollering.\u201cReally?\u201d I asked.\u201cAlmost,\u201d he said more gently. \u201cPeople don\u2019t listen to German folk songs.\u201d Raising his voice again, he added, \u201cNationalism is out!\u201dIn that moment, I was reminded that before the fall of the Iron Curtain, while West Germans were still struggling to comprehend and expose Nazi crimes, East Germans were taught a different version of World War II history, one that depicted them as heroes in the global fight against fascism. Some scholars suggest that the East German deflection of blame reverberates today in the form of a greater willingness to accept far-right nationalism. It\u2019s perhaps no coincidence, then, that Pegida demonstrations are more prominent in the former East Germany, and that Alternative for Germany won 22 percent of the Eastern vote in the recent election.After enough demonstrators gathered, they went on a short march around the town hall, with its soaring clock tower, and back to the square. Anti-fascist counterdemonstrators, most of them young, many of them university students, held a banner that said \u201cMake Borders History\u201d and yelled, \u201cNazis out!\u201d Pegida demonstrators, many of them old enough to be the counterdemonstrators\u2019 grandparents, retorted: \u201cYou\u2019re the Nazis!\u201dSoon after the Pegida demonstrators returned to the square, Kubitschek hopped onto a makeshift stage and clutched a microphone. The center of his speech was an extended metaphor featuring a cat and its avian prey, a dove that can\u2019t get away because it has a broken wing.\u201cNow, it is dragged down the stairs,\u201d he said, staring into the crowd. \u201cIt does not flutter anymore. It does not defend itself. Its head bangs against every step, and there\u2019s a long way to go until we reach the cellar.\u201d\u201cActually, we are way too big for this cat that is dragging us behind it,\u201d Kubitschek continued, \u201cand yet for some reason, we do not get on our feet. But we must get back on our feet ... and climb up again step by step.\u201dThe crowd cheered and chanted: \u201cResistance! Resistance!\u201dThe source of the contempt, according to Kubitschek, was Germany\u2019s \u201cmemory politics,\u201d the effort by Germans to confront their Nazi past, which involves tempering any nationalist urges. New Right thinkers see that restraint not as a virtue but as a symptom of a deeply ingrained self-hate \u2014 a hatred that must be overcome for Germany to be great again.In January, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, the AfD leader, voiced a similar lament in a speech at a beer hall in Dresden, and much more caustically. Germans are \u201cthe only people in the world who have planted a monument of disgrace in the heart of their capital,\u201d he said, referring to the Holocaust memorial near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. German history was being made \u201crotten and ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cannot and must not go on like this! There is no moral duty to dissolution!\u201d The speech provoked a national uproar, and even some politicians within AfD criticized it.Kubitschek saw it as a tactical error. H\u00f6cke\u2019s comments, he said, were \u201ccorrect in substance but wrong in tone.\u201dKubitschek has had greater success advancing the \u201cself-dissolution\u201d theme in the meta-political realm. Recently, he published a book called \u201cFinis Germania,\u201d written by Rolf Peter Sieferle, an environmental historian. Sieferle warned that shame over Nazi crimes is driving a neurotic German belief that the \u201cEarth will be cleansed from the shameful mark of the eternal Nazis only when the Germans have completely disappeared.\u201dIn June, \u201cFinis Germania\u201d was selected for a prominent book-of-the-month list, an entry into the mainstream of public opinion that itself stoked another major controversy. How could such a book, deemed anti-Semitic and extremist by many within the media and literary establishments, be so readily accepted into the public discourse? Kubitschek called the reaction a \u201cpanic.\u201d Expanding the boundaries of discourse was precisely what Germany needed, precisely what the Volk required. This was the way to heal its broken wing.Kubitschek casually mentioned that he would not mind at all if a strongman came to replace Merkel, if that was the only way to correct her decision to allow the migrants to enter Germany. In a time of great peril, he noted soberly, a leader must act beyond the law. He cited Carl Schmitt, the conservative political theorist who criticized parliamentary democracy and aligned with the Nazis after they took power: \u201cSovereign is he who decides on the exception.\u201d Merkel herself had acted outside the law by opening the border, Kubitschek said, and that proved she was sovereign. And yet, he continued, \u201cI\u2019d have absolutely nothing against it if someone came along and with the same sovereignty did the opposite. Someone who would say: \u2018The experiment is over. The Parliament won\u2019t be consulted. I will prop up with my power the administration, the organs of the state, the police\u2019 \u2014 who would in any case be supportive \u2014 \u2018the border patrol, the military, and we will end this experiment.\u2019 That means: borders shut. Test to see who can be assimilated; they can stay. Those who can\u2019t be assimilated, they\u2019ve got to go.\u201dIt was clear the Kubitschek considers \u201crefugee\u201d a misnomer. These were not, for the most part, refugees fleeing persecution or war, but opportunists \u2014 mostly \u201chungry young men,\u201d as he put it \u2014 acting \u201cvery rationally\u201d to improve their lot. These migrants arrived in an \u201cinsecure\u201d country, he said, where the people \u201cdon\u2019t know who they are or what belongs to them.\u201d The migrants, he said, therefore begin to think, Doesn\u2019t everything here belong to everyone? \u201cAnd then the waves are set into motion, and they say: \u2018All right, here we have a country, a fallow country, and it\u2019s a country that must be conquered, and it can be conquered. And it won\u2019t be conquered with ladders for storming fortresses or with machetes, but with sheer presence.\u2019\u2009\u201d Everyone at the table seemed to agree that the consequences of this conquering were dire. Crime, they argued, was on the rise; women could no longer feel safe walking alone outside at night. \u201cWe all know the dystopian stories,\u201d Kubitschek said. Matters might get \u201csupercharged in a hyper-identitarian way,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it once again becomes really brutal or cruel, we don\u2019t know. It can also transition over into a country that is no longer Germany.\u201dI asked Kubitschek about the sharp rise of right-wing violence in Germany since the refugee influx. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction that someone can have who really has the feeling that his country is being taken,\u201d Kubitschek said, \u201cthat everything he knows and what he grew up in is changing, and who sees that something totally alien is spreading and he doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d\u201cIs violence justified?\u201d I asked.\u201cI don\u2019t see it as justified,\u201d he said. The migrant is \u201cultimately only the figure that we can see, so to speak, but behind him is much bigger development.\u201d He said that the young male migrants who come to Germany as asylum-seekers must be frustrated \u2014 they are being treated like kindergarten kids, given enough to eat and a place to sleep, but they have no real chance to become part of the society. \u201cThey want to work,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to meet a few women. They simply want to take their lives into their own hands. And it\u2019s not at all possible here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country doesn\u2019t need these people.\u201dKubitschek mentioned an article he read about a small village in Saxony-Anhalt where a large number of asylum seekers had been settled. \u201cThat is also a form of violence,\u201d he said.\u201cClearly!\u201d said one of the men at the table.\u201cThe village is being changed in its substance,\u201d said Kubitschek. \u201cOr perhaps even being destroyed.\u201d The question, he added, is: \u201cWhy must we be O.K. with that?\u201d\u201cWhy then isn\u2019t violence justified?\u201d I asked. If these refugees were conquerors, and their presence was destroying a way of life, couldn\u2019t a person justifiably claim self-defense?\u201cThe refugee is the false opponent,\u201d Kubitschek said.After a pause, he added an amendment. \u201cActually, if it\u2019s going to come to violence, we ought to storm the Parliament. We have no replacement to offer, but this woman can\u2019t govern any longer. We must go on from here in a different way.\u201dThen Kubitschek announced that there had been too much talking. \u201cEverything is clear, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, inspiring a round of laughs from the table.He and a friend picked up guitars, and they began to sing old German folk songs, some of them with beautiful, baroque melodies. The first was a martial homage to Georg von Frundsberg, a German mercenary who fought for the Holy Roman Empire and was famed for his brilliant infantry maneuvers. Von Frundsberg hailed from a town not far from where Kubitschek grew up, and in 1525 he helped Emperor Charles V secure the imperial throne with a decisive victory at Pavia, in what is today Italy. Everyone at the table sang along.\u201cThe one who won the battle,\u201d they sang. \u201cThe one who won the battle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Newark Says, Hey Amazon, Look Over Here", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe city sits astride an extensive transportation network of trains, planes and automobiles. It has six colleges and universities with a total of 60,000 students. There is prime office space available, and new apartments downtown are far less expensive than housing in New York City or even Jersey City.The city is Newark.\u201cWe have exactly what Amazon is looking for, in terms of expanding their company in a city that will help them grow and where it would have real social impact,\u201d said Mayor Ras J. Baraka in an interview. \u201cNewark is an opportunity to make a real statement, about what they\u2019re trying to accomplish in the United States in the age of Trump.\u201dOn Monday afternoon, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Cory A. Booker, the former Newark mayor, joined Mr. Baraka at Rutgers Business School, which shares its building in the city with Audible Inc., whose 1,000 employees produce and sell audio entertainment and which is owned by Amazon, to announce that Newark is the state\u2019s official bid in the headquarters race.Governments have fallen over themselves offering Amazon billions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies and, in some cases, free land, prompting criticism from some economists and good government groups.In New Jersey, Mr. Christie and legislative leaders are offering up to $7 billion in state tax breaks for Amazon. The company already has a substantial footprint in the state, where it has several distribution centers that employ 5,500 workers, at substantially lower wages than are being promised for HQ2. Last year, Amazon announced it would open two more centers, adding another 2,000 full-time jobs.\u201cThey\u2019re talking about doubling already generous corporate tax breaks,\u201d said Jon Whiten, vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspective. \u201cThey\u2019re not saying, we\u2019ll invest billions in New Jersey Transit so workers can get to work on time, or in affordable housing so workers can have a decent place to live.\u201dHandicappers have put New York in the top 10 among the competitors for an HQ2 based on Amazon\u2019s own criteria, which include good public transportation, a skilled work force, the cost of doing business and a location within a metro area of more than one million residents.Moody\u2019s Analytics ranked New York sixth, behind Austin, Tex.; Atlanta; Philadelphia; Rochester; and Pittsburgh.But the Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm that represents companies seeking locations and cities trying to attract them, ranked the New York metropolitan area No. 1, ahead of Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston, out of 35 candidates.\u201cIt\u2019s at the absolute top in the sheer number of educated people and it\u2019s at the top with mass transit,\u201d said Patrick L. Anderson, the firm\u2019s founder. \u201cBut it\u2019s at the bottom in the cost of doing business.\u201d\u201cNew York can win,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it can\u2019t be in Manhattan, and I doubt it\u2019ll work in Brooklyn.\u201dThat could be the silver lining for Newark, where commercial rents are a third to half of those in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Newark may not have the glamour of New York City, but it\u2019s only an 18-minute train ride away. And market-rate apartment rents \u2014 which run about $30 a square foot \u2014 are the equivalent of subsidized housing in New York City.Newark also sits directly above the fiber optic cable spine running along the Eastern Seaboard, allowing companies to tap into some of the fastest internet services in the country and among the least expensive ultra-broadband network.And downtown, there is a Whole Foods \u2014 the upscale supermarket chain Amazon acquired earlier this year \u2014 as well as the fast-growing headquarters of Audible.The city, with its battle-scarred reputation, may seem like a long shot, but Mr. Baraka has pulled together a coalition convinced that Amazon would accelerate the city\u2019s comeback. There is a total of $2.6 billion worth of projects in the pipeline, according to acting Deputy Mayor Carmelo Garcia.\u201cI think the prospects are great,\u201d said Ben Feigenbaum, chief operating office of Edison Properties, a major landowner in Newark. \u201cAll the developers and political leaders know that Amazon would be good for everyone.\u201dHis company is in the midst of converting a 110-year-old warehouse at Edison Place and McCarter Highway into an office building, alongside a new park, Mulberry Commons, which the city is building after a decade of delays.Broadridge Financial Solutions, which provides technical services to financial institutions, recently announced it would move its headquarters and ultimately 1,000 employees to Newark from Jersey City. Several years ago, Panasonic moved its North American headquarters to a new glass tower downtown.There are also 7,000 apartments being developed downtown, once a mix of institutions, office buildings, courthouses and government offices.Many developers were wary when Mr. Baraka, son of the firebrand poet and activist Amiri Baraka, won the mayor\u2019s race in 2014. But he seems to have won their confidence with his focus on making the city better, not on higher office.And with a quarter of Newark\u2019s population living below the poverty line, he has pushed to extend the downtown development boom to the city\u2019s more impoverished areas in the south and west.As of this month, developers are required to set aside 20 percent of newly built or renovated apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants. In addition, the mayor has pushed developers to ensure that half the construction crews and half the permanent jobs for those projects are for Newark residents.\u201cThis administration has been an advocate for the progress we\u2019ve made,\u201d said Jonathan Cortell, vice president of L+M Development Partners, \u201cand very much intent on adding their own imprimatur on what we\u2019re doing next.\u201dThe project, which obtained tax credits and tax-exempt financing, includes 64 apartments for moderate-income households, such as a family of three making no more than $50,100.Audible subsidized the rents of 20 employees who moved into Hahne\u2019s as part of its Live Local program and helped create a pedestrian corridor between Audible\u2019s building and the rest of downtown.Two years ago, Audible established a technology venture fund in its building that has so far invested in 37 start-ups, with the hope that they will grow and rent space in Newark.For the last project, across the street from Audible, Ben Korman, a developer and the founder of Lotus Equity Group, is planning to demolish Riverside Stadium, a minor-league baseball park that was part of an earlier, ill-advised attempt to accelerate Newark\u2019s comeback. The city and the county invested as much as $34 million, but it never drew the hoped-for crowds.Even before the Amazon sweepstakes started, Mr. Korman\u2019s company planned to demolish the brick stadium to make way for a 2.3 million-square-foot mix of residential and commercial buildings, retail and green space. Amazon could speed up the construction schedule.An earlier version of a picture caption that accompanied this article misspelled the first name of the former mayor of Newark. He is Senator Cory A.

In this show, which runs through Nov. 24, he depicts the colors and energy of sport, often suggesting the deeper forces at play in games like soccer, rugby and cricket.With African players flocking to western European soccer leagues in the last generation, Mr. Thomas used his art to link that with the colonization of Africa by European powers.Mr. Thomas worked with his associates in his airy studio in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, cutting out soccer symbols and names for a series of quilts, based on \u201cthe function and aesthetic of Asafo flags, which have been made from the colonial period to today by the Fante people of Ghana, developed in relation to African contact with Europe starting in the 18th century,\u201d according to the notes from the Ben Brown gallery.The quilts incorporate techniques used by Picasso and Matisse, who were influenced by African art and symbols. Mr. Thomas points out that the Asafo flags borrowed symbols from the western invaders and colonists \u2014 yes, even the Union Jack \u2014 in their own military flags, to intimidate rival tribes.Mr. Thomas\u2019s interest in the overlap between sport and national interests also shows in his sculptures of a powerful-looking arm or an implement like an oval rugby ball or a flat-faced cricket bat.Social issues are never far from the surface. Mr. Thomas, 41, has sometimes used photographs of American athletes who spoke out.\u201cI can\u2019t ignore that there were very many other people active in civil rights, but Jackie Robinson not only integrated baseball but was also part of a World Series team here in Brooklyn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt changed the world, right?\u201dMr. Thomas\u2019s work often suggests the dangers hiding behind the rewards and fame of sport.

But sport is very rare.\u201dHowever, Mr. Thomas is hardly tailoring his work to depict the glory of sport. More likely, he is suggesting the athlete, however wealthy, is just another rower in the galley.\u201cSport can also be seen as a proxy for war,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a coincidence that the World Cup came around at the same time as colonialism. A lot of football clubs in England were part of the Industrial Revolution because workers needed some kind of leisure time.\u201dOne of Mr. Thomas\u2019s firm ideas is put in his low-key, thoughtful way: \u201cArt gives clues about our values in society. Art is timeless. Your art will outlive you.\u201dHe added, \u201cI believe all art is political. I certainly believe all sports are political. Not only because of the amount of money spent.

{"Headline": "Nafta Needs an Update, Not Repeal", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsCanada, Mexico and the United States belong to a North American neighborhood, and all three countries benefit from being strong and prosperous.North America is at a crossroads, with skepticism about the virtues of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United States\u2019 relationship with its neighbors. That skepticism disregards the considerable competitive advantage the agreement has given the United States and, in turn, transformed North America into a global powerhouse.Nafta was signed in 1993, when the economy was much simpler. We have a unique chance to take advantage of three countries meeting at the negotiation table in order to modernize the accord and to make it, once again, the world\u2019s state-of-the-art trade agreement. To maintain North America\u2019s competitive edge, we have three ideas to update and improve Nafta, rather than simply discarding it.First, the digital economy hardly existed in 1993; now it is a big part of the global economy and has to be incorporated into Nafta. That will benefit all companies, in particular small and medium enterprises that will use the internet to export to the region and worldwide.Second, reform Nafta regulations concerning state-owned enterprises. Competition from these companies \u2014 often government-subsidized \u2014 is often unfair; a clause in Nafta regulating the participation of state-owned firms in North America would serve as an argument in favor of including a similar clause for World Trade Organization rules. That would level the playing field in global trade for the three Nafta countries; the largest binational commercial deficit for each one is with China, which openly supports its state-owned companies.Third, government procurement in the three countries must be open to competition, with any North American company able to bid for jobs. In addition, severe measures to combat corruption should be added to the agreement.Being part of the North American free trade zone has helped United States manufacturing industries like auto, electronics and aerospace become more competitive, relative to their Asian and European competitors. This increased competitiveness results mainly from the development throughout the last 24 years of strong vertical supply chains that take advantage of economies of scale: Production takes place wherever it is most efficient. National borders matter relatively little, and final assembly generally has little to do with the national origin of the parts being assembled. Today, United States and Canadian manufacturers rely on Mexican suppliers to remain competitive and to be able to export their goods globally.We hear a lot about trade deficits, but repealing trade agreements will not fix the arithmetic. If a country consumes more than it produces, it will import more than it exports. Federal deficit spending, a huge and continuing act of dissaving, is the big culprit. Control that, and you will control trade deficits.North American countries should be working toward greater integration in energy and national security. When Nafta was first negotiated, the energy sector was excluded because Mexico\u2019s oil, gas and electricity industries were controlled by the state. But in recent years, Mexico opened up the sector to competition and foreign investment. The three countries should push toward an integrated North American energy market; that will favor the energy independence and national security of the region.George P. Shultz, a secretary of the Treasury in the Nixon administration and secretary of state in the Reagan administration, is a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford.

{"Headline": "Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and Glenn Close Speak Out on Harvey Weinstein", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Streep\u2019s statement seemed to have opened the floodgates, with Glenn Close, Kate Winslet and Judi Dench, among others, soon voicing their own dismay and disgust about Mr. Weinstein.And in a statement on Monday, SAG-Aftra, Hollywood\u2019s largest union, called Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior \u201cabhorrent and unacceptable.\u201dIn her statement, Ms. Streep also said Mr. Weinstein had been \u201crespectful\u201d during their working relationship, and challenged the widely repeated narrative that his misbehavior had been a longtime open secret in Hollywood.Here is Ms. Streep\u2019s full statement:The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes.One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn\u2019t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And if everybody knew, I don\u2019t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.In a statement to The Times, Ms. Close said that she felt \u201cangry and darkly sad,\u201d and that while Mr. Weinstein had been decent with her, she had heard rumors of inappropriate behavior toward women over many years.Her full statement:I\u2019m sitting here, deeply upset, acknowledging to myself that, yes, for many years, I have been aware of the vague rumors that Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of behaving inappropriately around women. Harvey has always been decent to me, but now that the rumors are being substantiated, I feel angry and darkly sad.I\u2019m angry, not just at him and the conspiracy of silence around his actions, but also that the \u201ccasting couch\u201d phenomenon, so to speak, is still a reality in our business and in the world: the horrible pressure, the awful expectation put on a woman when a powerful, egotistical, entitled bully expects sexual favors in exchange for a job.Ms. Winslet won a best actress Oscar in 2008 for her role in \u201cThe Reader,\u201d which was released by the Weinstein Company.Ms. Dench, who has credited Mr. Weinstein with launching her film career, also took aim, saying in a statement to Newsweek that while she had been \u201ccompletely unaware\u201d of any misconduct, she found it \u201chorrifying,\u201d and gave her \u201cwholehearted support to those who have spoken out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Milan, a Revival Stars Two Legendary Soccer Names", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMILAN \u2014 A.C. Milan\u2019s museum sits on the ground floor of the club\u2019s gleaming administrative headquarters, Casa Milan, in a smart district to the north of the city. It is a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of fans before most home games.Those who visit shuffle past jerseys worn by some of the team\u2019s legends, cluster around displays showing video of its most famous games and lean in for selfies with a scale model of a helicopter owned by its former owner Silvio Berlusconi.The grand finale sits behind a screen. Every few minutes, it pulls back to reveal a circular room filled with glass-fronted cabinets, each one containing a trophy. The star attractions, the ones that catch the eye, are on the left-hand side: seven replicas of the European Cup, one for each of Milan\u2019s victories. It all looks a little like something out of the \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d films, a hidden trove; you expect smoke to billow from the floor and ominous music to strike.A few floors above, Marco Fassone, the club\u2019s managing director, feels the pull, and the pressure, from below. In recent years, it has felt as if that is where Milan\u2019s best days are: in the museum, relics of a time now passed. Fassone\u2019s job is not just to add to that collection. It is to bring what he calls the club\u2019s golden age into the present.\u201cIt is not so far gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not in the memory of our parents: It is still part of the club. It is not a century ago. It is recent history: We won the European Cup 10 years ago. The majority of people here were part of it, and they want to be part of it again.\u201d\u201cThey said Italian football was in crisis,\u201d Gennaro Gattuso, the Milan and Italy midfielder, said after the 2007 Champions League final. \u201cWell, the World Cup is here, and so is the European Cup.\u201dItaly could lay claim to being soccer\u2019s greatest power, and the city of Milan was the engine behind it.Now, that seems like a scene from another world. In retrospect, 2007 was not the start of a new era for Italy, but almost the final salvo of an old one. Milan has won only one championship in the decade since. Inter \u2014 since winning a treble under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2014 Serie A, Coppa Italia, Champions League \u2014 in 2010, has disappeared from view, too. Milan has not played in the Champions League since 2014. Inter last qualified in 2011.That fading luster reflects a broader decline. As Milan has waned, so too has Serie A: its finances paltry compared with those of the Premier League, Bundesliga and Spain\u2019s top tier; its teams, Juventus apart, unable to compete; its stadiums crumbling and decaying.Some see Milan\u2019s clubs as a symbol of that decay, too. To others, their struggles are not just a consequence, but a cause. In the summer, Andrea Agnelli, then the president of Juventus, admitted in an interview with Tuttosport that his team\u2019s archrivals had been \u201cmissed.\u201d\u201cI hope they will re-emerge, behind us, this year,\u201d he said.There was, at the start of the season, every reason to think that would happen. When Milan and Inter meet in the first derby of the year this weekend \u2014 the game known as the Derby della Madonnina \u2014 both will be under Chinese control.\u201cThe fact that both teams were sold to Chinese enterprises would have been unthinkable three years ago,\u201d Fassone said. \u201cIt is something that is hard to imagine for a lot of Italians.\u201dFew, though, doubted it was necessary. Both clubs had been drifting for too long. This, many believed, was the start of a transformation not just for Milan and Inter, but for Serie A, too. Milan\u2019s ambition, in particular, captured the imagination: This summer, it embarked on what Fassone described as \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d transfer market campaign it could muster. Some 11 players arrived in the space of two months. The moves convinced the fans, and the country, that Li was serious.\u201cYou can speak, but people only trust your project when they see, every week for a month, you are presenting one or two new players,\u201d Fassone said. Suddenly, he felt an \u201centhusiasm that had been lost\u201d returning to the club. A crowd of 65,000 turned up to watch the new-look team\u2019s first game of the season, an unremarkable game in the first qualifying round of the Europa League.\u201cIt was a symbol that they are with us,\u201d Fassone said. \u201cNow the fans are dreaming again.\u201dFassone, who had worked for a host of other Serie A teams, including Napoli, Juventus and Inter, said he had never found it so \u201ceasy\u201d to coax prospective signings aboard. \u201cThere is something that attracts them immediately,\u201d he said.His coach, Vincenzo Montella, has found crafting a team a little more difficult: Milan has won four and lost three of its first seven Serie A games, and his hold on his job is already under scrutiny. Last week, Berlusconi \u2014 content, now, to comment from the sideline \u2014 added his voice to the chorus of criticism.Inter, still unbeaten under its coach, Luciano Spalletti, is faring better, but the road has not been smooth. Spalletti is Suning\u2019s third manager in a year; one of his predecessors, Frank de Boer, lasted 85 days. Still, in the eyes of Aldo Serena, a former player for both teams, Inter is a \u201clittle further ahead\u201d in its progress than Milan.Serena, now a television commentator, holds out hope that Milan will find its feet, echoing the feeling of many that it would benefit not just the city, but Italian soccer as a whole.\u201cItaly needs a strong Milan and a strong Inter,\u201d Serena said. \u201cItalian football is worth much more in terms of television rights, internationally, with a strong Milan and Inter, because they have so many fans around the world.\u201dThat, Fassone said, was part of the appeal to Li when he decided to invest in Milan, a club he believed was \u201cthe only one of the top five or six names in Europe that was available.\u201d Milan, like Real Madrid, has a passionate following in China.The worry is that the resurgence of Milan and Inter alone will not be enough to inspire a renaissance in Serie A; the change, Fassone said, must be much more sweeping than that.This month, Infront Sports & Media, the company that arranges Serie A\u2019s international television deals, held talks in London to discuss the next batch of rights, which will run from 2018 to 2021. For the first time, when those contracts are awarded, 4 percent of the funds raised must be allocated to stadium renovation across the country.It is proof of a belated recognition that Serie A must modernize as a whole if it is to compete, that it cannot simply hope to piggyback on the success of Juventus or increased interest in Milan and Inter.\u201cWe have many old stadiums that were built in a different age,\u201d Fassone said. \u201cThere are athletics tracks, bad sight lines and in the last 10 rows of the bottom tiers, you see nothing.\u201d That and the lingering threat of fan violence limit crowd sizes, restrict corporate income and afflict not only those in the stadium but how the league appears on television.\u201cTeams like Milan, Inter, Roma can build new stadiums,\u201d Fassone said, noting Italy\u2019s parliament is discussing a law that will make it easier. \u201cI would say that in the next five years, most of the important clubs will have a new \u2014 or renovated \u2014 stadium. If we use them correctly, as they do in England or Germany, we can have three times our current income.\u201dThat, however, is just the start. Fassone said there must also be an acceptance that Serie A must change how it negotiates its television contracts, how its executive board functions and how it reaches out to new markets.A decade ago, Milan and Italy felt they were still living through their golden age. It will take a lot of work \u2014 in Milan and elsewhere \u2014 to bring back those days, to bring Italian soccer out of the museum.Advertisement"}

Will Americans like the view inside Taika Waititi\u2019s head?Supported byThat day, Waititi was shooting a scene with Jeff Goldblum. Waititi himself would be performing opposite the star in a motion-capture suit, which visual effects would turn into a character named Korg. \u201cI\u2019ll need to have a shave,\u201d he said, \u201cafter the coffee.\u201d He gestured at his cup. \u201cYou know,\u201d Waititi said, feigning amazement, \u201cthey give this to you for free.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHollywood!\u201dWaititi, 42, is just the latest in a long string of upstart directors \u2014 like Colin Trevorrow (\u201cJurassic World\u201d), James Gunn (\u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d) and Gareth Edwards (\u201cGodzilla\u201d) \u2014 handed the keys to some of the most expensive entertainment machines in the world. Studios hire these indie auteurs to deliver (at a reasonable price, and in a way they feel they can control) a little shot of cool to a staid or stagnant property. Sometimes, as with Patty Jenkins on \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d the spark delivered by a new director can reinvigorate an entire cinematic universe and stave off franchise fatigue; other times, as with Josh Trank\u2019s disastrous \u201cFantastic Four,\u201d the move puts a small-movie director in a position to fail more hugely than anyone ever imagined possible.In many ways, Waititi neatly fits the mold of a lively director plucked from indiedom and placed at the center of a franchise. He\u2019s stylish, funny and confident. His handcrafted, quirky comedy-dramas \u201cBoy\u201d (2010) and \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople\u201d (2016) grossed a cumulative $5.5 million in the United States. Up to now, his most prominent American credit was a few episodes of the HBO comedy \u201cFlight of the Conchords,\u201d starring his college friends Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie. Much of his CGI experience came from a Sour Patch Kids commercial starring Method Man.But in one very obvious way, Waititi doesn\u2019t fit the mold. All those other directors are white; Waititi is Maori, from the Te Whanau-a-Apanui tribe, and so the bet Marvel was making by hiring Waititi was not only on an indie director but also on the first indigenous person ever to be handed the reins of a superhero megamovie. One reason they felt comfortable giving him those reins was that \u201cBoy\u201d and \u201cWilderpeople,\u201d despite their minuscule American box office, were offbeat crowd-pleasers \u2014 indeed, in New Zealand they were blockbusters, the most popular Kiwi films ever made, in part because of the complex way Waititi treated his Maori heritage on-screen.Marvel asked Waititi to meet in summer 2015. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think this was my cup of tea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to be wanted, though.\u201d Given the brief to pitch directing a \u201cThor\u201d buddy comedy that he would help write, Waititi suggested \u201c\u2009\u2018Withnail & I\u2019 in space,\u201d \u201cjust these two people who happen to be superheroes making their way across the universe.\u201d (In this formula, the Hulk is the volatile Withnail figure, and Thor must \u201ctake care of this time bomb and keep him out of trouble\u201d as they travel from planet to planet.) In their final meeting, Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, asked Waititi why he thought he could handle such a gargantuan project. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been doing it in my head my whole life,\u201d Waititi replied. Feige loved that answer, because he feels that\u2019s how he got his job, too.Directing a movie like \u201cThor\u201d requires a daunting set of skills, many of which have little to do with framing a shot: the temperament to manage a set with as many as 1,000 people on it rather than 100; the know-how to oversee complex effects; the canniness to please your bosses; the confidence not to be intimidated by the money, the stars, the vastness of the task. You\u2019re more the captain of a complex, hierarchical aircraft carrier than the solo skipper of a dinghy. At one point, Waititi cheerfully calculated that he was spending the cumulative budget of his previous four films every few weeks on the set of \u201cThor.\u201dThat approach sounded a little scary. Waititi giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying if, like, if you let them see the terror,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hide it really well.\u201dIn 2005, his short film \u201cTwo Cars, One Night\u201d was nominated for an Academy Award. An 11-minute vignette about Maori kids stuck waiting for their parents in the parking lot outside an East Cape bar, the short is less antic than Waititi\u2019s features would be but is a low-key prototype for the kinds of stories he wanted to tell, which he has described as \u201ceither comedies with depressing bits or dramas with funny bits.\u201d At the Oscars, as Jeremy Irons introduced the nominees for best live-action short film, Waititi pretended to be asleep in his seat as the camera tracked to him. (He thought his fellow nominees had agreed to the gag, cooked up over drinks one night, but the rest weren\u2019t serious.) \u201cI had no intention of being a filmmaker,\u201d Waititi said, but the short \u201cgot a lot of attention, and I didn\u2019t have anything else on.\u201dHe also had a national film commission that was eager to finance his directorial work. Waititi\u2019s first feature, \u201cEagle vs. Shark,\u201d was an aggressively quirky romance between two misfits, played by Clement and Loren Horsley. He followed it with an expansion of \u201cTwo Cars, One Night\u201d: \u201cBoy,\u201d about a Michael Jackson-mad Maori kid called Boy growing up in the East Cape in the 1980s and his ne\u2019er-do-well father, played by Waititi himself. With its wicked humor and unsentimental treatment of Maori life, it was an immediate sensation in New Zealand, becoming the highest-grossing locally produced film of all time. \u201cBoy\u201d featured Waititi-drawn animation and a \u201cThriller\u201d-meets-Maori-war-dance number, but just as often, Waititi\u2019s directorial flourishes served to deepen and sadden the film. One recurring flashback is a bloody tableau of Boy\u2019s mother lying dead while his weeping aunties cradle his infant brother.After a mockumentary about vampire roommates, \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows\u201d \u2014 directed with Clement \u2014 Waititi made \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople.\u201d A spirited comedy about a foster kid lost in the bush with his grumpy guardian, \u201cWilderpeople\u201d grapples with grief and puts its heroes in real emotional and physical danger, transforming into a classic family-adventure story that just happens to center on a juvenile delinquent who names his dog Tupac. As with \u201cBoy,\u201d audiences embraced a story with predominantly Maori characters as archetypically Kiwi. \u201cHe welcomed everyone into Maori culture,\u201d says the Maori actor Rachel House, who played a maniacal child-protection officer in \u201cWilderpeople\u201d and is also in \u201cRagnarok.\u201d The film surpassed the domestic box-office record set by \u201cBoy\u201d in a month and a half.In hiring Waititi for \u201cThor,\u201d Marvel found a director with an anarchic visual aesthetic whose storytelling interests were nonetheless deeply, satisfyingly conventional. \u201cIn a lot of my films,\u201d Waititi said, \u201cthe biggest theme is family, making families out of those around you.\u201d That theme drives Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d series, an unexpected hit whose energy the third \u201cThor\u201d movie seems designed to replicate.Thanks to Waititi\u2019s dogged geniality, the 84 days of principal photography for \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d were, according to basically everyone, pretty fun. He opened the shoot with a ceremony featuring ritual dances and greetings from the local Aboriginal tribe, the Bundjalung people, as well as a Maori celebrant. \u201cA set should be like a family, except that you all actually like each other,\u201d Waititi said. \u201cWe just play music all day, we dance, we talk.\u201d At times it seemed Waititi \u2014 dancing, blasting disco \u2014 was putting on a one-man show with unflagging enthusiasm. Waititi\u2019s favorite gag, according to his star, Chris Hemsworth, was to \u201cforget\u201d his set mike was on and then to perform complaints about his leading actor, midtake, for everyone to hear: \u201cAh, we should\u2019ve got the other Chris. Chris Pine, Chris Pratt, anything but Hemsworth.\u201d Then there\u2019d be a muffled scrabbling, and Waititi would say, \u201cOh, crap \u2014 sorry, guys, sorry.\u201dCornel Ozies, an Australian Aboriginal filmmaker who was one of eight native people Waititi invited to shadow him on the \u201cRagnarok\u201d shoot, characterizes Waititi\u2019s on-set style as specifically indigenous: \u201cIf you talk about his Maori heritage, it\u2019s big families. When you have big families, you\u2019re going to have a lot of clashes,\u201d adding, \u201cyou pick up the skill set of being a mediator.\u201d For Waititi, the choice to maintain this disposition, which he calls \u201cHappy Taika,\u201d underlies his entire directorial philosophy. \u201cI\u2019ve been on a lot of film sets,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve always promised myself I wouldn\u2019t create a set where people dread coming to work.\u201d He made a face like a kid tasting something sour. \u201cShooting a movie should be fun! It\u2019s not a real job. It can be hard, but at the end of the day we\u2019re dressing up and playing pretend.\u201dWaititi found that a production this size lessened the responsibility he had to take on, making the job of a director a simpler one. On his earlier films, Waititi often felt he had to do everything. \u201cWhen it\u2019s low-budget,\u201d he said, \u201cevery job you take is one you don\u2019t have to pay someone else to do.\u201d Here there were hundreds of crew members around, which encouraged Waititi to delegate. On those other films too, he knew that any decision he made about lighting, sets, even performances was \u201cbasically baked in forever.\u201d On \u201cThor,\u201d where digital artists waited to paint over every frame, that pressure was lessened. \u201cIn some ways,\u201d Waititi observed, \u201cthis makes you feel a little lazier. You\u2019re like\u201d \u2014 he waved his hand dismissively \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018Ah, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine later.\u2019\u2009\u201dOn a set where every action shot was previsualized and every stunt was choreographed, it wasn\u2019t always easy to direct instinctively, as Waititi was used to doing. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cit\u2019s just too late to say, \u2018Oh, man, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if like a thousand robots came in and Thor fell off a cliff?\u2019\u2009\u201d But he still found ways to play. One day, while doing the motion-capture for Korg, Waititi rushed into a battle sequence wielding a big prop hammer, then flipped the hammer around and started pretending to shoot it like a gun. \u201cO.K., CGI,\u201d he declared, \u201cI want you to turn that hammer into a gun hammer.\u201d In the finished movie, that dumb idea is a delightful reality.Pretending at this scale is a lot easier for an indie director, of course, when he\u2019s working inside a system expressly designed to have megamovie training wheels. Waititi was surrounded, the Marvel executive producer Brad Winderbaum noted, with experienced, talented technicians. Once the shoot was over, he had a year of postproduction to hone the story and several weeks of scheduled reshoots to fix anything that went wrong the first time around. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to feel out at sea, wondering how he\u2019s going to achieve this,\u201d Winderbaum said, and then with a shrug offered a fittingly superhuman claim of omnipotence: \u201cWe know how to achieve everything.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s our code name,\u201d Waititi said in his office with a happy grin. He\u2019s tall and slim, his hair that December day buzzed and gray at the temples, piled pell-mell in a dark Lyle Lovett pouf at the top of his head. It was now 330 days until release. \u201cHopefully by June, July, the film will actually look somewhat like it should look,\u201d Waititi said. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s basically a blue screen with people in front of it. Its just blue, blue, blue, blue everywhere.\u201d He gestured at an editing bay in the corner, its monitor featuring Goldblum posing before a blue tarp.\u201cI\u2019m not a massive fan of the postproduction phase,\u201d he said. \u201cI really like being on set and making stuff up.\u201d Nevertheless, here he was, for almost a full year. \u201cI used to really laugh at everyone who was stuck in traffic, driving to the studios in Burbank,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m one of those people.\u201dWaititi walked across the hall into a dark, soundproof editing suite, where the editor Joel Negron, a veteran of Michael Bay blow-\u2019em-ups, waited at the Avid terminal. Frozen on a wide-screen TV was the face of Hemsworth\u2019s Thor, his once-flowing blond hair cut spikily short. \u201cIs that a spoiler?\u201d Waititi asked the publicist, pointing to the screen.\u201cNot by the time the story comes out,\u201d she replied.\u201cAh, you can write that down, then,\u201d Waititi said cheerily. \u201cWe Ragnaroked Thor\u2019s hair.\u201dThe haircut is a potent symbol of the brand-new Thor that Hemsworth craved. Up to now, Thor has been the most boring of the Marvel movie superheroes. \u201cI just ended up being the straight guy,\u201d Hemsworth told me. \u201cSort of the guy from another world who the joke was on him half the time. I wanted a little more wit and charm.\u201d In the first two films, Waititi said, Thor is \u201cbasically a rich kid from outer space who comes down to Earth and gets to kiss a cute girl.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThis is the most human that Thor\u2019s ever been. Luckily this film\u2019s coming out on Earth, and the audience will be predominantly human, so I think they\u2019ll relate to him much more than they have in previous films.\u201d\u201cCool,\u201d Waititi said. \u201cCut it in half, then it\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d Over the next two hours, Waititi and Negron chipped away, deleting lines they didn\u2019t find funny enough. They watched all 16 takes of Banner\u2019s response, in which Ruffalo\u2019s improvisations ranged from a deadpan \u201cOh, no\u201d to screaming shock. Waititi by now was sunk deep into the couch. He came upon a tweet from Peyton Reed, director of \u201cAnt-Man.\u201d Looking at his picture, Waititi said, \u201cAll these Marvel directors look the same!\u201d He laughed. \u201cScott Derrickson and James Gunn and Peyton all look like the same person.\u201d He asked to watch the very beginning of the sequence again: \u201cDo we have the other angle, from behind Banner?\u201d Negron opened a folder full of neatly labeled shots, in each of which Ruffalo, enthusiastically pretending to transform from a monster into a human, fell out of frame. Waititi mentioned that he was hoping the camera might pan down with Banner as he shrank; he hadn\u2019t shot it that way back in Australia, but in about two minutes Negron built a rough move inside the editing software, making it so.\u201cThat\u2019s fine for now,\u201d Waititi said. \u201cThe VFX team will perfect it later.\u201d One thing Waititi was delighted to discover while shooting a blockbuster is that it isn\u2019t that hard to create a shot he didn\u2019t actually get. \u201cWe scan every surface and every part of every set,\u201d he explained, including the entire interior of the bespoke spaceship. \u201cSo this all exists inside the computer, and we can move the camera and create moves.\u201dAround the world, 18 effects houses had started creating the hundreds of shots that would fill in all those blue screens. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any bits of my particular style, which is, like, purposefully crap,\u201d Waititi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Marvel wants. They want purposefully amazing.\u201d He stood and stretched, restless. \u201cHow long is it now?\u201d he asked.\u201cAbout two,\u201d Negron said.\u201cPretty good, guys!\u201d Waititi said. \u201cCut a minute out of the movie!\u201d\u201cCouple more to go and we\u2019re there,\u201d Negron said.Waititi opened the editing-room door with a satisfied flourish. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to kill your babies, as they say.\u201d\u201cDarlings?\u201d Negron asked.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I love them that much,\u201d Waititi replied. \u201cThey\u2019re just babies.\u201d\u201cThat particular franchise seems really hard,\u201d he elaborated in September. \u201cThere\u2019s not much room for someone like me.\u201d Through its narrow canon, the tone of \u201cStar Wars\u201d has always been determinedly self-serious, whereas the Marvel movies, like the decades of comics they sprang from, veer wildly from high drama to low comedy. And improvisation has been a tool in every Marvel movie since Robert Downey Jr. riffed his way through \u201cIron Man.\u201d \u201cTaika\u2019s a really funny actor,\u201d says Tessa Thompson, who plays Valkyrie in \u201cRagnarok.\u201d \u201cSo we had a lot of guidance for the improv. It wasn\u2019t a bunch of, like, ships without rudders slamming into each other.\u201d Indeed, Waititi figures, if it wasn\u2019t for his comedy chops, why would Marvel have hired him in the first place? \u201cThey want new voices and different ways of telling stories,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the work to do with actors, all the rescripting stuff in the moment \u2014 that\u2019s what I want to do, really. I\u2019m always going to leave the CG stuff up to someone else.\u201dIt was 50 days before release. Waititi, hair trimmed short and streaked with gray throughout, absolutely looked a year older. The movie would be delivered in its complete form around the beginning of October. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll show up and my key card will stop working, I imagine,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ve pretty much come very close to finishing what I can offer, you know?\u201dHe admitted that the final product doesn\u2019t betray much of his D.I.Y. aesthetic. But his stamp is on the film in other ways: in the way he has framed a superhero movie as a misfit family adventure with gun hammers. In the way he Ragnaroked Valkyrie \u2014 white and blond in the comics, but played here by Thompson, an actor of black and Latino descent. In the way the native filmmakers who shadowed Waititi learned that it\u2019s possible for an indigenous artist to dance his way through a $180 million movie.And in the way he ricocheted around the big Marvel ship, putting on a two-year show, using all the tools they bought for him to make something he likes \u2014 \u201ca Taika version of one of these movies,\u201d he said with satisfaction. It\u2019s worth noting that Marvel\u2019s next directors and superheroes also look less like Marvel directors, less like the stereotype of Marvel heroes: Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d arrives in February, and Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden (the writer-director duo behind the 2006 Ryan-Gosling-on-cocaine drama \u201cHalf Nelson\u201d) are in preproduction for a movie featuring the superheroine Captain Marvel for 2019. Waititi dressed up and played pretend, and with the help of Marvel\u2019s omnipotence, he can now direct any movie he likes, big or small. As the Marvel ship plows on, churning up piles of money, its superheroes might soon come to resemble the predominantly human audience that watches them on Earth.Dan Kois is a frequent contributor to the magazine and an editor at Slate.

{"Headline": "Why Democrats Need Wall Street", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMany of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party, led by Bernie Sanders, are advocating wealth redistribution through higher taxes and Medicare for all, and demonizing banks and Wall Street.Memories in politics are short, but those policies are vastly different from the program of the party\u2019s traditional center-left coalition. Under Bill Clinton, that coalition balanced the budget, acknowledged the limits of government and protected the essential programs that make up the social safety net.President Clinton did this, in part, by moving the party away from a reflexive anti-Wall Street posture. It\u2019s not popular to say so today, but there are still compelling reasons Democrats should strengthen ties to Wall Street.Democrats should keep ties with Wall Street for several reasons. The first is an ugly fact of politics: money. Maintaining ties to Wall Street makes economic sense for Democrats and keeps their coffers full.For the 2020 election, some of the party\u2019s strongest potential presidential candidates \u2014 Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris as well as Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor \u2014 should not be dismissed simply because of their current or past ties to Wall Street.If voters really hated ties to Wall Street and financial elites, Republicans would not enjoy such a commanding electoral position \u2014 or have elected a New York plutocrat president. Most voters\u2019 major problems with President Trump stem from his performance, not from his wealth or connections to Wall Street.Third, it is hypocritical for Democrats to maintain ties to Silicon Valley and then turn their backs on the very people who help finance its work. The financial industry brings to market the world\u2019s most innovate products and platforms that expand the economy and create jobs.Fourth, demonizing Wall Street does nothing to bridge the widening gaps in our country. Wall Street has its flaws and abuses, which were addressed in part by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. And yes, the American people are certainly hostile to and suspicious of Wall Street. But using this suspicion and hostility as the organizing principle for a major political party will consign Democrats to permanent minority status.Here\u2019s what the Democrats need to do instead: develop a set of pro-growth, inclusive economic policies. Democratic leaders must prioritize entrepreneurship, small-business growth and the expansion of job-training and retraining programs.The Democrats need to partner with the financial community on these issues. Most important, the Democrats have simply had an ineffective, negative and coercive economic message. Advocacy of a $15 minimum wage and further banking regulation does not constitute a positive, proactive agenda.The Democrats cannot be the party that supports only new, stifling regulations. Reducing regulation allows banks to employ capital and finance investment in our country\u2019s future, making electric cars, renewable energy and internet connectivity across the globe a reality.If the party is going to have any chance of returning to its position of influence and appeal, Democrats need to work with Wall Street to push policies that create jobs, heal divisions and stimulate the American economy.Douglas Schoen was a pollster and senior political adviser to President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 2000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Acting to Protect Buyers of Seller-Financed Homes", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLegislators in three Midwestern states are taking steps to protect consumers who buy cheap and often rundown homes from investors through seller-financed deals or rent-to-own leases.Sales of rundown homes on long-term installment contracts \u2014 sometimes called contracts for deeds or land contracts \u2014 to people who could not qualify for a traditional mortgage are surging in several states, especially in the Midwest.Seller-financed deals can provide a path to homeownership because the monthly payments can be less than the prevailing monthly rents in some neighborhoods.Nonetheless, the deals have made a comeback over the past decade because the housing crisis created a ready supply of foreclosed homes for speculators and investment firms to buy and then resell.In Ohio, Michele Lepore-Hagan, a Democratic state representative from Youngstown, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would require property owners to solve any housing code violations and pay outstanding fines before selling the homes to buyers in contract-for-deed transactions or in similarly structured rent-to-own leases.And in Michigan, a group of state legislators led by Steve Bieda, a Democratic senator from suburban Detroit, has been working on a bill that would address similar abuses with contracts for deeds.In Detroit, for example, cheap homes sold on contracts for deeds have consistently outpaced the number of homes sold in the city with traditional mortgages.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Tax Plan Rollout Nears: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We\u2019re watching to see how any charges that Robert Mueller files that are related to the Russia investigation affect this week\u2019s tax plan rollout. More on that in a minute.S. & P. futures were down this morning, perhaps because of the newest wrinkle in what was already a complicated legislative process for enacting tax cuts. Republicans still don\u2019t seem to agree on what should be in the plan.The plan is to keep the tough trade-offs in the bill secret until after Halloween, then reach Thanksgiving with bills passed by the House and Senate and hit New Year\u2019s Day with a bill on Mr. Trump\u2019s desk. That\u2019s close to financial-crisis speed, pushing Congress into a kind of emergency lawmaking mode it typically uses only when inaction means cataclysm.Based on Mr. Trump\u2019s own pronouncement, we could learn this week his choice to lead the Federal Reserve. It\u2019s still a guess as to whom the president will nominate \u2014 or even whether that nominee will share the White House zeal for financial deregulation.That may throw up some obstacles to Mr. Powell\u2019s confirmation by the Senate. More from Mr. Appelbaum\u2019s article:\u201cSenator Scott is looking for fresh leadership at the Federal Reserve, and Mr. Powell would have to answer serious concerns both old and new at any potential nomination hearing he might have before the Senate Banking Committee,\u201d said a spokesman for Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. What\u2019s fascinating is the fault line between Mr. Bannon and his particular brand of nationalism, and Mr. Singer, who is considered a \u201cglobalist\u201d \u2014 and has ties to Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.But it\u2019s unclear whether the White House will turn on Mr. Singer. Yes, the Elliott Management founder was an early backer of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement. But he has since signed onto the team of White House supporters, donating to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and providing money for the Republican tax overhaul campaign.Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up:Pushing for answers will be Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. His criticism of technology companies may be surprising, considering he built a fortune as a tech and telecommunication investor and executive. But he wants to ward off further problems.\u201cWhat I fear is 2018. If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I.,\u201d he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.In other problems for tech companies:Information wars in emerging markets may not represent as big a threat to Facebook\u2019s business as angry lawmakers in Washington.

{"Headline": "In Amazon Bid, New York Brags About, Well, Everything", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Empire State Building, 4 Times Square, 1 World Trade Center and other New York City skyscrapers were bathed in orange light on Wednesday night. Halloween had not come early. The color was a nod to the arrow in the logo of the giant retailer Amazon, designed to mark the moment New York City delivered its bid for the company\u2019s second headquarters.Taking Amazon\u2019s criteria into account, New York\u2019s proposal boasts of the nation\u2019s largest tech talent pool, with 300,000 workers in the metro area, double that of either San Francisco or San Jose.New York is also an international capital of finance, law, fashion, education, art, culture and communications. And despite recent problems, it has one of the best and most extensive public transportation systems in the world, as well as train stations and international airports.The city\u2019s proposal cites four neighborhoods \u2014 the West Side of Manhattan; Lower Manhattan; Long Island City in Queens, and what is referred to as the Brooklyn Tech Triangle \u2014 the Downtown, Dumbo and Brooklyn Navy Yard areas \u2014 that could accommodate Amazon\u2019s requirements: 500,000 square foot modern of office space available in 2018 and another 7.5 million square feet over time as Amazon builds the kind of urban campus it has in Seattle.New York City is not offering special subsidies or tax breaks for Amazon beyond the incentives available to any company.\u201cWe see this as a competition for 50,000 new job openings \u2014 jobs we want New Yorkers to land,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday. \u201cWe win it based on the talent of our workers and the incredible diversity of industries in this town. Those are the strengths you can\u2019t buy with tax breaks.\u201dChicago tried to get a jump on the competition by submitting its proposal on Monday, three days early. The same day, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey dangled $7 billion in subsidies and incentives behind its bid to put Amazon HQ2, as the project has become known, in Newark.Handicappers place New York high on their lists of possible winners. Moody\u2019s Analytics, an economics research firm, ranked New York sixth, behind Austin, Tex.; Atlanta; Philadelphia; Rochester; and Pittsburgh based on six criteria, including human capital, cost of doing business and transportation.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics said, it is very likely that Amazon will put HQ2 on the East Coast, \u201cpreferably the Northeast Corridor.\u201d In that case, New York rises to No. 3 behind Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\u201cNew York gets dinged by its cost structure,\u201d he said.Amazon is expected to winnow its list of candidates by Dec. 25, but the review process will extend well into 2018.In addition to New York City\u2019s proposal, the state is putting up its own candidates. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is backing proposals from Western New York and the Finger Lakes; the Syracuse area; the region near Albany; and a metro New York City bid that includes Long Island and parts of the Hudson Valley.The state\u2019s top economic development official, Howard Zemsky, has crafted an incentive or subsidy package for Amazon, although state officials declined to release details because of the competitive nature of the contest.In drafting its proposal, the state has had to navigate the upstate-downstate divide, not wanting to be accused of favoring New York City.\u201cThis project is a major opportunity and New Yorkers should know that we are doing everything we can to attract Amazon HQ2 \u2014 and 50,000 jobs \u2014 to the Empire State,\u201d Mr. Zemsky said in a statement Wednesday.City officials have also had to step lightly, not wanting to set off interborough rivalries. After Amazon announced the contest in September, officials from nearly every corner of the city wrote directly to Amazon explaining why it should come to their respective areas. The city itself received applications from 27 neighborhoods.Ultimately, officials said that neither the Bronx nor Staten Island could meet Amazon\u2019s criteria for an urban campus. Staten Island, however, may have won a consolation prize.Amazon is building a distribution center there that is expected to eventually employ 2,250 workers, albeit at lower wages than at the new headquarters. For that, the state is giving Amazon up to $18 million in tax credits, based on its payroll numbers.Last month, Amazon signed a lease for a large block of space on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, where it expects to have 2,000 jobs in finance, sales and marketing. The company also has administrative offices on 34th Street and a photography and videography studio in Brooklyn with about 50 employees.Some developers, like Stephen M. Ross, chairman of Related Companies, are skeptical that a company so sensitive to cost would consider New York City.Mr. Ross\u2019s company submitted bids in New York, Chicago, where it has a vacant 62-acre parcel, and Boston.City officials asked landlords in each of the four New York City areas to lock up 500,000 square feet of vacant space for Amazon until the end of the year.The West Side of Manhattan features the Hudson Yards development, a transit hub at Penn Station and as much as 26 million square feet of available office space, as well as housing, culture and parks.But is also the most expensive option in a city where housing and office costs are already higher than elsewhere.Lower Manhattan, has evolved into a residential and commercial district since the Sept. 11 attacks, with a large development site available at the World Trade Center.Amazon, according to the city\u2019s proposal, could also make use of Governors Island, for an innovation center that could attract visitors and tourists.The so-called Brooklyn Tech Triangle, may be more likely. There are already 17,000 jobs at 1,400 tech-related or innovative companies and an array of arts and cultural organizations in the area.Next to Barclays Center, there is a site for a 1 million-square-foot tower.The other option is Long Island City, Queens, a former industrial area that is similar to where Amazon built its campus in Seattle. The neighborhood has new housing, restaurants, bars, art galleries museums and locations for up to 13 million square feet of new office space.Boosters for each neighborhood have been eager to make their cases.\u201cBrooklyn stacks up well not just in the city but from a nationwide perspective,\u201d said Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership.\u201cLong Island City checks every box Amazon has on its list,\u201d countered Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership.

{"Headline": "In New York, an Influential First Lady Redefines the Position", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, has far extended the boundaries of what a first lady does in the city.Supported byIn a lace-accented white wedding gown, Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York City, made her way up the church aisle and turned to face the crowd. Arrayed before her were not the familiar faces of friends and family, but dozens of other women in similar bridal attire as they prepared to march across Upper Manhattan in solidarity against domestic violence.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like putting on the garb,\u201d she said after the event last month.After nearly one full term, Ms. McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, has fully wrapped herself in the role of political spouse, a job especially steeped with symbolism for her. As the African-American wife of a white mayor in a moment of renewed racial strife across America, Ms. McCray has emerged as likely the most influential, if not consequential, first lady in the city\u2019s history.She has a full-time staff of five and her own public schedule. She oversees a portfolio of municipal programs, including her signature $850 million mental health initiative, in which other city officials report to her. She controls an independent nonprofit with a $25 million annual budget and still more staff. And she has the mayor\u2019s ear on decisions big and small, sitting in on top-level job interviews, policy formulation and senior staff meetings.In a wide-ranging interview this month at Gracie Mansion, Ms. McCray outlined her ambitious agenda, which is topped by reimagining mental health services as one of city government\u2019s core responsibilities. \u201cI want to be clear,\u201d she said, \u201cthat my job is to make systemic change.\u201dAnd if that is not the typical first lady\u2019s purview, so be it. \u201cThere\u2019s demands, there\u2019s expectations, there\u2019s traditions, and then there\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d she said with a laugh.While she has no permanent office of her own at City Hall, her influence is such that aides will sometimes seek the first lady\u2019s buy-in and input on an idea before even going to Mr. de Blasio. Andrea Hagelgans, a senior adviser to the mayor, approached Ms. McCray about putting together a paid parental leave program for city employees before she spoke to the mayor. She signed on, and so did he.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s always in every meeting,\u201d Ms. Hagelgans said. \u201cBut she\u2019s in everyone\u2019s thought process.\u201dWhen she enters a room, Mr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray invariably kiss on the lips \u2014 whether it is on stage at a rally or at more intimate City Hall staff meetings. Some aides look away; others roll their eyes. But most are now adjusted to the public displays of intense affection that broadcast the couple\u2019s interdependence.\u201cThey\u2019re each other\u2019s oxygen,\u201d said Peter Ragone, a former senior adviser to the mayor who has known the couple for two decades. \u201cI hope if I ever get married again I can figure out what they\u2019ve got.\u201dMore than a foot shorter than her nearly 6-foot-6 husband, Ms. McCray has an upright posture and a warm smile, when she chooses. She speaks softly, firmly and without fear, but is openly more comfortable with the written word. She has written poetry for most of her life, and she previously signed off her emails with the line, \u201cYour silence will not protect you,\u201d from one of her favorite black lesbian poets, Audre Lorde, whom she quoted in her speech at the brides\u2019 march.Ms. McCray has her detractors, but few have been willing to publicly voice their criticism as the mayor marches toward re-election next month. Some in the mental health industry, for instance, suggested that her initiatives have been more focused on branding and splashy announcements than on outcomes, but they refused to be quoted on the matter because they still hope to compete for lucrative city contracts. It\u2019s one thing to criticize Mr. de Blasio, multiple people who work with City Hall said; it\u2019s another to speak ill of his wife.From the start, Mr. de Blasio was insistent on her having a title beyond first lady, according to past and present city officials, and quickly installed her as chairwoman of the Mayor\u2019s Fund to Advance New York City, a nonprofit that works in tandem with City Hall. There was an internal debate about having the mayor\u2019s wife solicit private industry for money, but Mr. de Blasio pushed past those concerns.The fund raised $45 million in her first two full years at its helm, including six-figure checks from real estate, energy and finance industries, according to federal tax and city records. She said she makes fund-raising calls weekly.Susan Lerner, executive director of the watchdog group Common Cause New York, called the nonprofit, which predates the de Blasio administration but was not previously run by the mayor\u2019s wife, a \u201cbackdoor way to curry favor.\u201d\u201cWhen you donate to it, you expect that the mayor knows you\u2019re supporting his priorities and his program,\u201d Ms. Lerner said.Ms. McCray is also at the table for all of the mayor\u2019s most important meetings. One of the pointed questions that she is known to ask job candidates is whether they send their children to public schools.\u201cIf you ask the right questions, you learn a lot about people,\u201d Ms. McCray explained. \u201cLike the why \u2014 why public school? Why not public school?\u201dMr. de Blasio gushes about how much he values her advice; in his first six weeks as mayor, he called her \u201cmy guiding light,\u201d \u201cmy closest confidante,\u201d \u201cmy partner in all I do,\u201d and \u201cmy No. 1 adviser.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why anyone would think I would wear jeans to a funeral. Like why? Why would they even?\u201d Ms. McCray said, still visibly stung.\u201cThat first year was hard,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, who was a top City Hall adviser at the time, and is a longtime friend of the family. \u201cThere were so many tongues wagging about what her role would be. Was she the \u2018co-mayor\u2019? There was sexism, there was racism that she faced and when you actually looked at the work, it was pretty impressive.\u201dShe launched Thrive NYC, an umbrella of 54 mental health initiatives with a four-year budget of $850 million, setting out, among other things, to train 250,000 New Yorkers in Mental Health First Aid over five years, and launching a city-sponsored 24-hour hotline for mental health and substance abuse services.Together with the Mayor\u2019s Fund, Ms. McCray is at the center of nearly $1 billion in spending. But of the 54 initiatives in Thrive NYC, 31 previously existed at agencies scattered across the city; one of the new initiatives was an ad campaign promoting the program and free text and phone hotlines already existed in the private sector, although unconnected to city services.Asked what her biggest legacy would be, she did not cite specific city programs, saying instead it was about a culture shift around mental health. Richard Buery, the deputy mayor for strategic policy initiatives who has worked closely with the first lady, echoed her remarks.\u201cIn some ways, I think the biggest achievement is elevating this work to a priority of city government because mental health has never been considered a core of city government,\u201d Mr. Buery said.At City Hall staff meetings, Ms. McCray often remains quiet, presumably preferring to wield her opinion in private. But while professional staff often chafe at the sight of influential political spouses, many mayoral aides said Ms. McCray is typically welcomed. \u201cThere\u2019s no one better at keeping his volatile personality in check than her,\u201d said one of the aides, granted anonymity to candidly discuss internal City Hall dynamics.Her public image is not haphazard. She has occasionally consulted with Ebs Burnough, a former adviser to Michelle Obama and a brand specialist (he did not respond to requests for comment) and as first lady she has kept a blog to maintain her voice. In 2016, she wrote a poem about the city placing feminine hygiene products in schools. \u201cConsider the tampon,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo essential, so taboo.\u201dHer schedule can read like a map of multiculturalism in New York: opening a 24-hour center for L.G.B.T.Q. youth in Queens, touring an urban farm in East Harlem, a Hispanic Heritage event at Gracie Mansion one night and a transgender theater performance another, opening a substance use clinic at the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis headquarters in Manhattan, attending a reading of writer James Baldwin at a center for black culture \u2014 all since late September.Bertha Lewis, an African-American political activist who once served on the mayor\u2019s transition team but has become a critic of the administration, said Ms. McCray should be more outspoken. \u201cIt would really be good if she speaks out and tells her husband you\u2019re hurting my people,\u201d Ms. Lewis said.Ms. McCray bristled at other critics\u2019 accusation that she, and her husband, have sometimes focused on forgotten corners of the city to the exclusion of everyone else. \u201cThe fact that we are doing things for all communities is not reflected in the tabloids at all,\u201d she said, citing the creation of universal prekindergarten, while voicing a disdain for the news media that she shares with Mr. de Blasio.\u201cI have the advantage of many perspectives as someone who has lived in different kinds of communities: as a woman, as someone who previously identified as a lesbian, as someone who is a person of color,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of life so that informs what I do.\u201dAs the ranks of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s veteran advisers has thinned throughout his term, and with even more departures expected following a November election in which the mayor is heavily favored, Ms. McCray\u2019s internal influence is only expected to grow in a second term.\u201cDon\u2019t think it\u2019s just me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has many advisers and he makes the final decision.\u201d Then she added, \u201cBut he does value my opinion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The public adored the companies\u2019 new devices, educators embraced their tools and politicians extolled their contributions to the economy. Even traditionally powerful voices, like media and telecom businesses, found little success in criticizing the technology industry.The reviews site Yelp, which has long complained about the size and power of Google, has filed a new federal antitrust complaint against the search giant. Media organizations are arguing, to a more receptive Capitol Hill, that internet businesses should have the same advertising disclosure rules that print and television companies do.\u201cWe\u2019ve had low points, when we were out of energy and felt like we weren\u2019t heard,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp. \u201cBut we feel we have a clean slate now.\u201d\u201cBefore, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cBut now the halo is a bit off these companies.\u201dInternet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill. House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending \u2014 a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier. Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers. They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.\u201cIt is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill. In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business,\u201d Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, \u201cand that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.\u201dThe tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well. In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission. In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.\u201cIn the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Google and Facebook and the future of the news business,\u201d Mr. Chavern said in an interview before the hearing.Even nonprofit consumer interest groups are taking advantage of the situation. John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, who is a longtime critic of Google\u2019s collection of personal data, has pushed for online privacy rules and restrictions for self-driving vehicles.

{"Headline": "Why Surge Prices Make Us So Mad: What Springsteen, Home Depot and a Nobel Winner Know", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsWhen Bruce Springsteen decided to do a run of shows at a Broadway theater with fewer than a thousand seats, he appeared to reject the laws of economics \u2014 or at least what would seem to be in his financial best interest.It sure looks as if Mr. Springsteen left a great deal of money on the table and impeded the laws of the marketplace. After all, some people got tickets for $75 for which others were willing to pay four figures.But the strategy may be less irrational than the raw numbers suggest. And understanding the hidden logic behind concert pricing \u2014 or how Home Depot responds to a hurricane, or even how your neighborhood restaurant handles the Valentine\u2019s Day crunch \u2014 can provide a guide to solving some of society\u2019s biggest problems while satisfying people\u2019s deep need for a sense of fairness.Technology is making \u201cvariable\u201d or \u201cdynamic\u201d pricing \u2014 the same strategies that ensure a seat on an airplane, a hotel room or an Uber car are almost always available if you\u2019re willing to pay the price \u2014 more plausible in areas with huge social consequences.Dynamic pricing of electricity could help bring down pollution, reduce energy costs and make renewable energy more viable. Constantly adjusting prices for access to highways and congested downtowns could make traffic jams, with all the resulting wasted time and excess emissions, a thing of the past. Any sector where supplies tend to be fixed but demand fluctuates \u2014 the water supply, health care \u2014 would seem like prime candidates for variable pricing.But technologists, entrepreneurs and regulators who would go down this path first need to learn a few lessons from Mr. Thaler \u2014 and Mr. Springsteen.\u201cA good rule of thumb is we shouldn\u2019t impose a set of rules that will create moral outrage, even if that moral outrage seems stupid to economists,\u201d Mr. Thaler said.As it turns out, when you look at when and how dynamic pricing provokes outrage, you detect some patterns \u2014 and a guidebook on getting some of the benefits of economic efficiency without fueling outrage that dooms the entire project.The underpricing of popular concert tickets is nothing new. In an earlier era, this was visible in long lines of fans camping out to buy them. Now, the gap between fans\u2019 willingness to pay and the official price drives online ticket marketplaces, and a constant cat-and-mouse game pitting concert promoters against ticket brokers. And Mr. Springsteen\u2019s show is grappling with the same challenge that \u201cHamilton,\u201d and other hot tickets on Broadway have faced: limited seating, seemingly limitless demand.Research by the economists Marie Connolly of the University of Quebec and Alan Krueger of Princeton based on a sample of major concerts in 2006 estimated that artists and promoters left about 5 percent of potential income (or around $200 million) on the table by underpricing tickets relative to the market rate.\u201cI say, please, let me take some of those and price them at market,\u201d Mr. Geiger said at the Music Industry Research Association conference in August in Los Angeles. Confoundingly, he said, the same artist might chafe at discounting the back rows of an arena to ensure a sellout, for fear of appearing to give away tickets too cheaply.\u201cWe are still coming out of the era of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll socialism,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the concert industry is still in a bit of head-in-the-sand economics.\u201dBut given that the apparent underpricing has been so widespread and so persistent, is it possible the strategy is more rational than it seems? That\u2019s what Ms. Connolly and Mr. Krueger argue. For artists, no one show exists in a vacuum. And the things that might maximize revenue for any given night might not be the elements that matter in the longer term in developing devoted fans.There\u2019s the issue of fairness, of course. Fans don\u2019t want to think their favorite artist is gouging. And the entire concert experience may be better if raucous superfans are in the front rows, rather than whoever is able to pay four figures for a ticket. The goal is to create an experience that makes everyone leave with a warm glow, their fandom of that artist that much deeper.So one view of the Springsteen approach is that it is economically irrational. But another is that it is part of a long-term relationship between a performer and his fans.That might be a lesson for the other industries where variable pricing could make a lot of sense.Those scorching days of midsummer, when every air-conditioner in a hundred-mile radius is cranking at full blast, are hard on utilities.Most of the time, they can meet electricity demand with modern, efficient natural gas power plants that keep power flowing consistently at reasonable cost and with moderate carbon emissions, combined with nuclear and renewable energy plants that are pretty much always operating.But on brutally hot days (and perhaps a few bitter cold days in the winter, too), things get trickier. To keep up with demand, utilities have to turn to old, expensive, dirty coal and oil plants. Some power plants maintain a crew year-round in order to be able to generate electricity only a few days during peak demand.As a result, the cost of energy production can be four or five times as high on a high-demand day as on a low-demand day.Yet the way most Americans buy electricity, that is all invisible. Utilities typically charge a single price per kilowatt-hour of electricity no matter when it was used.If the price of electricity varied from hour to hour as airline tickets do, it might create incentives on high-demand days for consumers to set their air-conditioners a few degrees higher or to postpone running their washer and dryer till the overnight hours. The old, inefficient plants could be mothballed, and air pollution would decrease.But the people working on such programs are also aware of some of the problems that could emerge if they aren\u2019t careful. And they come back to some of the same notions of fairness that underpin the concert pricing conundrum.It could get worse. If a poor older person turned off air-conditioning during a heat wave to avoid the price spike and died of heat stroke, it would be a human tragedy. People on supplemental oxygen can\u2019t turn the machines off to save money.\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that you don\u2019t just give people a raw price signal, but provide them with support and financing to invest in the infrastructure to respond appropriately,\u201d said Daniel Esty, a Yale environmental law professor and former commissioner of Connecticut\u2019s energy and environmental protection agency. \u201cEven better over time would be a system where people don\u2019t have to think about it, where smart appliances are connected to a smart grid that would enable them to do their part in a kind of invisible-hand sort of way.\u201dThe Illinois program has included email and text alerts to tell people when surge pricing is in effect, and some customers are using technology involving smart thermostats so that their temperature setting adjusts automatically. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be something people need to monitor every day to be successful,\u201d said Sarah Gulezian, senior manager of dynamic pricing programs at Elevate Energy.Moreover, it might prove possible to create pricing structures that guarantee consumers won\u2019t pay more than they would have under traditional pricing, essentially seizing the benefits of dynamic pricing without anyone getting an unpleasant risk of sticker shock. That\u2019s because most households see savings under the plans, and only a handful see their prices rise.Utilities and regulators, in other words, have to think a little like Mr. Springsteen: It\u2019s not just about maximizing the efficiency of the energy market on any one day, just as the Boss isn\u2019t trying to maximize his revenue from any one concert. Rather, it\u2019s about maintaining a relationship in which people do not feel like they have been exploited.Some short-term inefficiency can buy long-term viability. And that\u2019s never truer than when disaster strikes, whether a heat wave, a blizzard or a hurricane barreling toward the most populous area of Florida.The first thing they did was direct all prices to be frozen in areas likely to be affected by the storm. There is no surge pricing at Home Depot stores after a disaster, in both a longstanding corporate policy and a matter of law in many states.But the company doesn\u2019t stop with that. All those logistics people and other staffers are there to ensure that the surge in demand after a disaster is matched with a higher supply of the goods people need.As hurricane season approaches, dedicated warehouses are stocked with goods that will be needed if a major storm hits, according to the company\u2019s director of corporate communications, Stephen Holmes. And that\u2019s why, as soon as Irma passed the Miami area and the major highways were confirmed to be passable, a convoy of 41 tractor-trailers full of generators, plywood, chain saws and similar items trekked from Georgia to South Florida, escorted by the police.The key is responding to a desperate situation not by raising prices, but also not by being content with shortages of badly needed goods. Rather, emergencies are an occasion to increase supply, even if it means incurring big logistical costs to do so.That could have a lot of implications, including for your morning commute.The Capital Beltway that encircles Washington and its near suburbs is more than just a metaphor for the alleged insularity of the people who live within it. It is often a traffic-choked monster that ruins the commutes of many who must use it.But for a 14-mile stretch, there is an out if you have the money. A parallel toll road allows those willing to pay \u2014 20 cents a mile during slow periods, $1 a mile during a typical rush hour, more during times of extreme traffic \u2014 to ensure it is never clogged.In these areas, there is too much demand for space on the roads and too little supply of road, and each of these strategies tries to use pricing to bring supply and demand into balance. But paying variable prices for a good that has previously been free (most roads) or charged at some fixed rate (traditional toll roads) raises all sorts of issues.This new approach to modulating traffic may become more acceptable to voters when it is part of an increase in supply.If variable tolls or congestion charges are merely about pricing some people out of the market and letting rich people avoid the nuisance of traffic, they probably won\u2019t go over so well. But if they are part of creating more supply of road, ensuring more people over all can get where they want to go \u2014 and if people are frequently reminded of that \u2014 the measures may go down easier.The Transurban deal with Virginia essentially makes private money available for additional road capacity \u2014 the express lanes on the Capital Beltway were built from scratch. Its existence also serves to reduce the traffic on the traditional lanes.Governor Cuomo has pitched a New York congestion fee as a funding stream to improve and expand New York\u2019s rail system. If that happens, it could mean more capacity to get people in and out of the city.Another lesson from these pricing experiments is that they tend to be most resisted when they are new. When Stockholm experimented with a charge to enter the city center in 2006, it was highly controversial, with people in suburban towns especially viewing it as an unfair tax.\u201cI think an important lesson is that the conception of what is fair changes,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore the charge, the discussion was of how unfair it was and how it would be hardest for low-income people. Now when we do surveys, we find that people think it is unfair if the people who use the streets and pollute and increase congestion don\u2019t pay. We\u2019ve seen this everywhere that has implemented congestion charges, that public support increases afterward.\u201dPeople\u2019s perceptions of what is fair and just are not set in stone; they evolve over time. But companies looking to use variable pricing have to be cognizant of how important it is to respect those perceptions.It has adopted a quicker trigger finger for eliminating surge pricing entirely in emergency situations, for one thing. When Mexico City had a major earthquake on Sept. 19, an operations worker at the company\u2019s local headquarters turned off surge pricing, even while the building was still shaking.\u201cThe fact that one of our teammates had the presence of mind to turn off surge in that chaotic moment, I think, reflects the deep responsibility we all feel toward our fellow citizens and the cities we serve,\u201d said Rodrigo Ar\u00e9valo, general manager for Uber in Latin America.Restaurants have long known that charging a fee for a reservation offends people\u2019s sensibilities \u2014 but that on a big night like New Year\u2019s Eve you can require everyone to eat an expensive fixed-price menu with lobster and filet. Diners will happily pay a surge price without thinking of it as such.What the successful examples of variable pricing have in common is that they treat customers\u2019 desire for fairness not as some irrational rejection of economic logic to be scoffed at, but something fundamental, hard-wired into their view of the world. It is a reality that has to be respected and understood, whether you\u2019re setting the price for a highway toll, a kilowatt of power on a hot day, or a generator after a hurricane.\u201cIf you treat people in a way they think is unfair, then it will come back and bite you,\u201d Mr. Thaler said. And it doesn\u2019t take a Nobel to understand that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Czech Election, a New Threat to European Unity", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRAGUE \u2014 He\u2019s a media-wise billionaire used to getting his own way, and promising to run the government like a business. He wants immigrants to stay away. And although his political positions are tricky to pin down, they are tinged with populist and muscular rhetoric.In the West, nationalist and populist parties have made substantial gains in recent elections. But in the East, resentment of Brussels and resistance to immigration have helped propel such parties to power in several countries, notably Poland and Hungary. Now, the Czech Republic may join them.Whether a wealthy oligarch with vast financial interests would prove as illiberal as Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s populist prime minister, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland\u2019s governing right-wing party, remains uncertain in a country as secular and Western-oriented as the Czech Republic. But Mr. Babis has suggested abolishing the Czech Senate and trimming the lower house of Parliament, moves that would strengthen the executive branch.Following a pattern that has become familiar in European elections, the Czech vote pits longstanding mainstream parties in decline against anti-establishment upstarts from all corners of the political spectrum.The youth-dominated Czech Pirate Party, which began in 2009 by calling for using the internet to streamline democracy, has seen its support in polls cross the 5 percent threshold to qualify for Parliament.On the far right, Tomio Okamura \u2014 a half-Czech, half-Japanese entrepreneur whose Liberty and Direct Democracy Party opposes immigration, and calls Islam an ideology rather than a religion \u2014 drew 6.9 percent in the last election and is expected to do better this time around.Mr. Babis refers to his party, Ano, as a movement to overturn a culture of corruption among the political elite. Ano means \u201cyes\u201d in Czech, but it is also an acronym for Action of Dissatisfied Citizens. Its slogan is simple and vague: \u201cThings will get better.\u201dMr. Babis\u2019s movement, formed in 2012, stunned the establishment by finishing second in parliamentary elections the following year, a strong enough showing to propel him and several supporters into major roles in a coalition government with the center-left Social Democratic Party and the center-right Christian Democratic Union. Mr. Babis served as finance minister.\u201cThe other parties are trying to push Babis out of politics, but it hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d said Pavel Fischer, the director of Stem, a nonprofit polling and research group in Prague.\u201cHe has tremendous power,\u201d said Otto Eibl, a political scientist at Masaryk University in Brno. \u201cSo the concentration of power in Babis\u2019s hands is enormous and some people are nervous about it. And they are right.\u201dBut Mr. Babis has been difficult to pin down on the issues. He opposes sanctions on Russia and seeks more trade with Moscow. He does not want to adopt the euro. He is fiercely resistant to accepting refugees, especially Muslims.And he is careful to keep his Brussels-bashing on the vague side.\u201cBabis\u2019s position on the European Union is not clear, because he is not talking about it most of the time,\u201d Mr. Eibl said. \u201cSometimes he is forced to say something, but he usually avoids such topics.\u201dRight-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Like other former communist nations, the Czech Republic had to create new parties from scratch after the fall of the Soviet Union. Center-left Social Democrats lined up against center-right Civic Democrats, with the remnants of the Communist Party hoping for a return to power.For more than a decade, with the economy rising at a brisk clip, voters seemed content to pass power among them. But the 2008 financial collapse shattered the equilibrium.\u201cNow, Czech voters are weary of traditional parties,\u201d Mr. Pehe said. \u201cAnd we see the rise of these populist movements.\u201dAntonin Gold, a real estate agent with no political experience, stood outside a subway station this month, wearing a badge identifying him as an Ano candidate for Parliament.Mr. Gold said he had become so upset by news reports about yet another corruption investigation that he decided to join Mr. Babis\u2019s movement.\u201cI didn\u2019t think I could ignore it any longer, and I had to take action,\u201d Mr. Gold said, pressing a leaflet into the hands of a woman scurrying past. He shrugged off the corruption charges as a move by the political establishment to cling to power.Polls show Ano drawing 25 to 30 percent of the vote, well ahead of the second-place Social Democrats, though predicting the outcome is complicated.\u201cMany people still are not sure who they will vote for,\u201d Mr. Fischer said. \u201cThe last days will be crucial.\u201dMr. Okamura, of the far right, certainly sees a connection between his approach and Mr. Trump\u2019s.\u201cI say we must make the Czech Republic good,\u201d Mr. Okamura said. \u201cNot great. I wanted to choose a word that Trump had not chosen. But of course, great would be fine.\u201dHana de Goeij contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How We Think About the Deficit Is Mostly Wrong", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWith their nine-page \u201cframework,\u201d President Trump and congressional Republicans have turned to tax cuts in a bid to get a victory on their policy agenda. Mr. Trump has promised to deliver \u201cthe biggest tax cut in the history of our country.\u201dAre the proposed tax cuts a huge giveaway to the rich? Most definitely. Will they, as advertised, create a booming economy with benefits that trickle down to everyone else? I don\u2019t think so. Mr. Trump\u2019s plan will widen the country\u2019s already dangerous wealth and income gaps, and because the gains go mostly to those at the very top, the tax cuts won\u2019t do much to promote broad-based consumer spending or overall job growth.That\u2019s enough to reject the plan. But it would be unwise to oppose tax cuts, or any other federal legislation, simply because they add to the deficit.Why? Because bigger deficits wouldn\u2019t wreck the nation\u2019s finances. Unfortunately, budgetary effects are the sun around which everything revolves in Washington. Should we invest a trillion dollars in our crumbling infrastructure, offer Medicare for All or pass the biggest tax cut in the country\u2019s history?Propose any of these, and the first question on everyone\u2019s lips will be, \u201cHow are you going to pay for it?\u201d The reason is simple: Lawmakers are obsessed with avoiding an increase in the deficit.The impulse is so strong that it\u2019s almost Pavlovian. It\u2019s also holding us back. Politicians of both parties should stop using the deficit as a guide to public policy. Instead, they should be advancing legislation aimed at raising living standards and delivering the public investments in education, technology and infrastructure that are critical for long-term prosperity.Right now, anything ambitious requires a score from the Congressional Budget Office. A \u201cbad\u201d score \u2014 one that adds to projected budget deficits \u2014 can easily doom good legislation because lawmakers are told that their math doesn\u2019t add up. And that\u2019s a problem.Because, actually, the math always adds up. To see why, we have to look beyond the government\u2019s balance sheet. Think of it this way. Government spending adds new money to the economy, and taxes take some of that money out again. It\u2019s a constant churning of pluses and minuses, and their minuses become our pluses.When the government spends more than it gets in taxes, a \u201cdeficit\u201d is recorded on the government\u2019s books. But that\u2019s only half the story. A little double-entry bookkeeping paints the rest of the picture. Suppose the government spends $100 into the economy but collects just $90 in taxes, leaving behind an extra $10 for someone to hold. That extra $10 gets recorded as a surplus on someone else\u2019s books. That means that the government\u2019s -$10 is always matched by +$10 in some other part of the economy. There is no mismatch and no problem with things adding up. Balance sheets must balance, after all. The government\u2019s deficit is always mirrored by an equivalent surplus in another part of the economy.The problem is that policy makers are looking at this picture with one eye shut. They see the budget deficit, but they\u2019re missing the matching surplus on the other side. And since many Americans are missing it, too, they end up applauding efforts to balance the budget, even though it would mean erasing the surplus in the private sector.And because there is so much misunderstanding, Americans are vulnerable to nationalist scare tactics that warn of the perils of relying on foreigners to pay our bills. The truth is, there\u2019s no reason to worry about China (or any other entity) refusing to finance our deficits. In fact, we should think of the government\u2019s spending as self-financing since it pays its bills by sending new money into the economy.When there\u2019s a deficit, some of that new money can be traded in for a government bond. What\u2019s often missed in the public debate is the fact that the money to buy the bond comes from the deficit spending itself.What isn\u2019t missed is the fact that the government pays interest on those bonds. Lawmakers are obsessed with this line item in the budget, as if it\u2019s akin to a cable bill that keeps taking a bigger and bigger bite out of your household budget. It isn\u2019t. Unlike a household, the government doesn\u2019t have to trim other parts of its budget to make ends meet. Congress can always create more room in the budget by adding rows or widening the columns to put more resources into education, infrastructure, defense and so on. It is purely a political decision.Of course, there are real limits to what can be done. No country can commit to large-scale infrastructure investment unless it has the available labor, machinery, concrete and steel. Trying to spend too much will cause an inflation problem. The trick is to adjust the budget to make efficient use of the people, factories and raw materials we have.But all of this goes unrecognized on Capitol Hill, where the very words \u201cdebt\u201d and \u201cdeficit\u201d have been weaponized for political ends. They serve as body armor to politicians who would deny resources to struggling communities or demand cuts to popular programs.Perhaps no one is more skilled in the dark art of deficit deception than Representative Paul Ryan, the House speaker. He has described the budget outlook as a \u201cfiscal train wreck,\u201d and he has demanded cuts to programs like Social Security and Medicare in the name of protecting future generations from a \u201ccrushing burden of debt.\u201d His language is poll-tested and inflammatory by design. It\u2019s intended to create a sense of urgency to move the budget into balance, where, we are told, the math of federal spending will finally \u201cadd up.\u201dIn a more rational world, lawmakers would abandon the crude C.B.O. scoring model and recognize that the risk of overspending is inflation, not bankruptcy. They would avoid fruitless battles over the debt ceiling, and they would acknowledge that the deficit itself could be deployed as a potent weapon in the fights against inequality, poverty and economic stagnation.Stephanie Kelton, a former chief economist for the Senate Budget Committee Democratic staff, is a professor of public policy and economics at Stony Brook University.Advertisement"}

The performance threatens to add insult to injury. The last surviving original member of the Dow Jones industrial average risks being excluded from the benchmark.With roots that go back to Thomas Edison\u2019s electric-light company in the 1870s, G.E. was one of 12 companies selected by Dow Jones when it created its market indicator in 1896. While some, like the American Cotton Oil Company and the National Lead Company, have long since faded into history, G.E. became a symbol of American industrial prowess. It began electrifying the railways in the 1890s, built the first American jet engine in 1941 and supplied the silicon for Neil Armstrong\u2019s moon boots. Under Jack Welch, it was an avatar of America\u2019s economic revival in the 1980s and 1990s, and became the world\u2019s most valuable company at the turn of the century.The conglomerate has underperformed for years, though, despite shedding its appliance and finance divisions and making big bets on power and energy. G.E. shares have produced a total return of minus 2 percent a year for the past 10 years, according to Eikon data, far behind the Dow\u2019s 8.4 percent annualized gain. The stock accounts for just 0.7 percent of the benchmark, well behind Apple\u2019s 4.6 percent and Boeing\u2019s leading 7.7 percent.The Dow is an oddity as the only major price-weighted United States market tracker, and for years G.E. has had one of the lower weights. There is no minimum weighting required, and the wonks at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices may be reluctant to drop the oldest constituent, especially as today\u2019s average contains few actual industrial companies. Yet the stock has already broken an unwritten rule that the ratio of the highest- to the lowest-priced stock should be 10 to 1.G.E. still boasted a $206 billion market cap by Friday\u2019s close, the 19th largest among United States companies, and exclusion from the Dow wouldn\u2019t necessarily trigger huge sell-offs because most indexed funds track broad indexes like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. But it\u2019s telling that AT&T has underperformed the Dow by 23 percentage points since it was removed to make way for Apple two years ago. Mr. Flannery is already considering slashing the dividend to conserve resources. The last thing he needs is the humiliation of being kicked out of the Dow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Many Academics Are Eager to Publish in Worthless Journals", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUniversities, colleges, even community colleges insist that faculty publish scholarly research, and the more papers the better. Academics and the schools they teach at rely on these publications to bolster their reputations, and with an oversupply of Ph.D.\u2019s vying for jobs, careers hang in the balance.Competition is fierce to get published in leading journals. But what about the overworked professors at less prestigious schools and community colleges, without big grants and state-of-the-art labs? How do they get ahead?As it turns out, many of their articles are appearing in \u201cjournals\u201d that will publish almost anything, for fees that can range into the hundreds of dollars per paper. These publications often are called predatory journals, on the assumption that well-meaning academics are duped into working with them \u2014 tricked by flattering emails from the journals inviting them to submit a paper or fooled by a name that sounded like a journal they knew.Many faculty members \u2014 especially at schools where the teaching load is heavy and resources few \u2014 have become eager participants in what experts call academic fraud that wastes taxpayer money, chips away at scientific credibility, and muddies important research.Predatory journals have few expenses, since they do not seriously review papers that are submitted and they publish only online. They blast emails to academics, inviting them to publish. And the journals often advertise on their websites that they are indexed by Google Scholar. Often that is correct \u2014 but Google Scholar does not vet the journals it indexes.The journals are giving rise to a wider ecosystem of pseudo science. For the academic who wants to add credentials to a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, for instance, publishers also hold meetings where, for a hefty fee, you can be listed as a presenter \u2014 whether you actually attend the meeting or not.But when I visited, the only venue was a small windowless room on the sixth floor of a hotel undergoing renovation. A handful of people sat in the room, diligently listening to a talk. Most who were listed on the program were not in attendance.Academics get rewarded with promotions when they stuff their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with articles like these, Dr. Pyne concluded. There are few or no adverse consequences \u2014 in fact, the rewards for publishing in predatory journals were greater than for publishing in legitimate ones.Dr. Pyne does not know what role those studies played in the promotions. But, he said, \u201cI can say that such publications do not seem to hurt promotion prospects.\u201dTensions over this kind of scholarship have spilled over Queensborough Community College, part of CUNY, the City University of New York.Although it is hardly known for its research, college administrators urge the faculty to publish. Recently a group of concerned professors complained that nearly a dozen colleagues have repeatedly published in at least one of the dubious journals \u2014 and have been promoted and rewarded for it.Noting that a number of these papers apparently depended on federal and city funds, the professors brought the matter to the attention of the vice chancellor for research and even wrote to the New York State inspector general\u2019s office.The school referred inquiries to its head librarian, Jeanne Galvin.\u201cJust as with many colleges, faculty submit their work for publication in a variety of journals based on individual judgment,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cQueensborough offers several advisory resources, such as workshops and individual consultation with expert librarians. The research that I have seen published by our faculty is of the highest quality.\u201dSome say the academic system bears much of the blame for the rise of predatory journals, demanding publications even from teachers at places without real resources for research and where they may have little time apart from teaching.At Queensborough, faculty members typically teach nine courses per year. At four-year colleges, faculty may teach four to six courses a year.Yet \u201cevery university requires some level of publication,\u201d said Lawrence DiPaolo, vice president of academic affairs at Neumann University in Aston, Pa.Recently a group of researchers invented a fake academic: Anna O. Szust. The name in Polish means fraudster. Dr. Szust applied to legitimate and predatory journals asking to be an editor.

Publications become part of the body of scientific literature.There are indications that some academic institutions are beginning to wise up to the dangers.Dewayne Fox, an associate professor of fisheries at Delaware State University, sits on a committee at his school that reviews job applicants. One recent applicant, he recalled, listed 50 publications in such journals and is on the editorial boards of some of them.A few years ago, he said, no one would have noticed. But now he and others on search committees at his university have begun scrutinizing the publications closely to see if the journals are legitimate.\u201cIf something gets published in one of these journals and it\u2019s complete garbage, it can develop a life of its own,\u201d Dr. Fox said.\u201cThink about human medicine and how much is on the line.

While it explores \u201chow Jewish families are broken over the politics of Israel-Palestine,\u201d he said in an interview, the cancellation was not about the play\u2019s substance.\u201cThe people who made this decision had no access to my script,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was about my beliefs.\u201dThe American Jewish Historical Society, which holds about 40 million archival items, including the original manuscript of Emma Lazarus\u2019s poem \u201cThe New Colossus,\u201d is one of five scholarly organizations housed at the Center for Jewish History. While they share a space, each operates with significant autonomy.Rachel Lithgow, the historical society\u2019s executive director, who programmed the two events, emphasized that the cancellation was the board\u2019s decision, which she disagreed with but accepted.\u201cI don\u2019t like this decision, nor have I liked other decisions that have been made,\u201d she said in an interview. But, she added, \u201cI answer to a board I respect.\u201dAsked about the board\u2019s description of the events as out of step with the society\u2019s mission, Ms. Lithgow, who said she had received numerous threatening emails in recent days, said simply, \u201cOur mission hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d (Bernard J.

{"Headline": "Fact Checks of the New York City Mayoral Debate", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckAssemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican nominee, and Bo Dietl, a businessman and television personality who is running on his own \u201cDump the Mayor\u201d party line, tried in various ways to suggest that New York City has declined under Mr. de Blasio.Here are some points of fact to help sort through the noise:Ms. Malliotakis rolled out what has been one of her prime lines of attack, painting a portrait of a city where crime is more rampant than Mr. de Blasio has acknowledged.She cited the rise in felony sex crimes, saying correctly that they had gone up during his time as mayor. Misdemeanor sex crimes are also up this year. The Police Department has attributed the rise, in part, to increased reporting by sex-crime victims. But those figures were an outlier amid broad declines in other categories.Mr. Dietl, a former police detective, suggested the statistics were not being accurately reported.A record number of people have been staying in city homeless shelters; on a recent night last week, there were 60,051 in Homeless Services Department shelters. An annual survey found 3,892 more living on city streets.Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Dietl attacked the mayor for not doing enough on homelessness. Mr. Dietl, in his characteristic bombast, said Mr. de Blasio had no plan.Ms. Malliotakis at one point latched onto a critique of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s housing plan from the left, saying that only a fraction of the $41-billion plan is aimed at those earning less than $25,000. She also attacked the plan for counting units that are rehabilitated or where new financing keeps them affordable, what is known as \u201cpreserved\u201d housing.That is true, but it is also part of the design of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan, which would create 80,000 units of new housing and preserve 120,000 more. Housing experts believe that approach is sound and tailored to the times, when the booming city economy has left little in the way of vacant land or derelict property for city officials to snap up.Transit is among the biggest issues for New Yorkers, and the debate over it contained a few whoppers. Mr. Dietl said the city had not been putting money into the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a claim that is not true.Mr. de Blasio stuck to his position that a tax on high earners is the best solution to the subway crisis, calling it \u201cvery, very popular.\u201d He is supported by a recent Quinnipiac University poll in which registered New York City voters favored \u201ca millionaire\u2019s tax\u201d over congestion pricing to raise money for mass transit by 64 percent to 21 percent.And third, as the look on the face of the moderator, NY1\u2019s Errol Louis, indicated, that was the question Mr. Dietl chose to ask?Advertisement"}

Since 2013, Australia has paid Papua New Guinea to house hundreds of migrants caught at sea trying to reach the continent.Papua New Guinea has said that resettling the migrants, all of whom are men, is the exclusive responsibility of Australia, and that it would not force the detainees to settle on the island. Officials, however, told the men they had to vacate the camp on Tuesday.The Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection, however, disputed that assessment. Australia has financed three alternative facilities in and around Lorengau and has pledged to provide food and other services to the migrants. How the men are moved to the new facilities is Papua New Guinea\u2019s responsibility, the department said.The closure of the camp and \u201cthe management of refugees and those found not to be refugees are matters for P.N.G.,\u201d the department said Tuesday in an emailed statement.Photographs posted online on Tuesday showed the detainees barricading the center with wire, in part to secure themselves from locals, who they claim are looting the camp.The men also took legal action on Tuesday, claiming through their lawyer that being denied water, food and electricity violated their human rights.Mr. Mohammad, who has gone through the vetting process, said it was not clear who would go, or when. And neither American nor Australian officials have provided a timeline.Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said that even with the expected departures, many migrants would remain in Papua New Guinea for the foreseeable future.\u201cWe know there is between 167 and 200 who are failed asylum seekers who definitely will not be going \u2014 and there are others, too,\u201d she said.Senator Nick McKim, of the Australian Greens party, who visited the island on Tuesday, called the standoff over the migrants a \u201chumanitarian emergency.\u201d He accused the Australian government of shirking its responsibility.Control of the detention facility will officially revert to the Papua New Guinea military on Wednesday.\u201cIt looks as though they will remove us from the center at some point,\u201d said Mr. Mohammad, adding that he had seen around 30 military and police vehicles driving around the area. \u201cWe are powerless and hopeless.\u201dJacqueline Williams contributed reporting from Sydney.

He discussed tax policy during lunch with members of the Democratic caucus. He displayed photographs of his trip to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on the Senate floor. And he serenaded a smiling Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, on his birthday.\u201cIt\u2019s been a packed day,\u201d said Juan Pachon, the lone aide accompanying Mr. Menendez. He turned as he saw the senator make his way toward a stairway. Mr. Menendez is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a meeting was starting in 10 minutes. Mr. Pachon chased after him. \u201cI haven\u2019t even had breakfast.\u201dIt was 2 p.m.Instead of occupying his Senate office, Mr. Menendez has been occupying the defendant\u2019s chair in a courtroom in Newark, where his slow-moving trial is stretching into its fifth week. He is accused of abusing his office to help his friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, in exchange for luxury gifts and political contributions. Both men have denied the charges.But on Thursday, a rare confluence of Senate activity and a court recess for a Jewish holiday gave Mr. Menendez an opportunity to return to Washington, his day a flurry of activity, notable even for the usually bustling senator.\u201cWhenever I get a chance to come back, I pack in as much as I can,\u201d he said in an interview squeezed between a floor speech and a vote.Mr. Menendez\u2019s hectic schedule underscores an effort to show that though he may be fighting to stay out of prison, he is still fulfilling his senatorial duties. His office churns out a steady stream of news releases \u2013 57 since the trial began \u2013 and has started new social media channels that feature supporters declaring how Mr. Menendez has helped them.He has trumpeted bills that he has been able to push along his month, including one on human trafficking, and he has taken part in certain votes by proxy.Mr. Menendez is confident of his innocence and said that he has \u201cno doubt that upon exoneration\u201d his poll standing will rebound, especially when voters realize the work he has done even while on trial. His numbers will rise, he said, and \u201cwe\u2019ll be re-elected.\u201d He declined, however, to discuss the trial.He arrived in Washington late Wednesday on an Acela train, and went straight to a meeting about Iran in the White House situation room with Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser. Then he headed to a conference center on Capitol Hill to deliver a speech about a program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation.On Thursday morning, he had breakfast alone in the Members Dining Room, though Senators Chuck Schumer and Richard Blumenthal stopped by to say hello.He arrived early for a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, beaming as he entered the chamber through the center door.He gleefully ribbed Mr. Cardin on his birthday, singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d in a deep baritone and jokingly promising that he would not reveal his age. (Mr. Cardin is 74).He thanked Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who recently announced his retirement, for his service, telling him, \u201cWhile I respect your decision, I\u2019m disappointed in it. I wish you were staying.\u201dHe pointedly questioned Jeffrey Gerrish, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to be the deputy United States Trade Representative, who was testifying before the Senate Finance Committee: \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be an advocate of observing the law that Congress put into effect.\u201dHe criticized the president\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria in a lengthy speech on the Senate floor, flanked by photographs of devastation \u2013 the photos, he noted, \u201clargely are pictures that I took.\u201dAfter a long absence, Mr. Menendez, a familiar face in the Capitol since his election as a United States representative in 1993, seemed determined to prove he still had his Senate legs.Though he announced at a news conference in Newark on Wednesday that he was heading to Washington, Mr. Menendez\u2019s arrival still caused a stir. Congressional aides and journalists, crowding a second floor corridor, murmured and nodded after Mr. Menendez emerged from an elevator.\u201cBob\u2019s here?\u201d Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat and New Jersey\u2019s other senator, said, after he was told why there were more reporters than usual at the Foreign Relations Committee meeting.He turned and made a beeline toward the front of the room, waiting patiently for Mr. Menendez to finish talking to Mr. Corker. The two men embraced and shook hands.Mr. Menendez\u2019s office has been working especially close with Mr. Booker\u2019s staff during the trial. The senators speak frequently \u2014 \u201cnot every night, because I think I would wear my welcome thin,\u201d Mr. Menendez joked \u2014 and their staffs confer daily.Despite the corruption charges, Mr. Booker has been steadfast in his support of Mr. Menendez, contributing to his legal defense fund, showing up for the trial\u2019s opening statements and offering unlimited praise (\u201cBob Menendez never stops working for New Jersey\u201d has become a regular refrain).In a politically charged era, an indictment hanging over a senator could lead to a lonely day in the Capitol. But when he wasn\u2019t running to meetings, Mr. Menendez received warm greetings from many Senate colleagues: John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, hugged him before a floor vote; Mr. Corker opened a morning committee meeting by telling him, \u201cWe\u2019re glad to see you here\u201d; and Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, interrupted an interview to greet Mr. Menendez.\u201cLet me just say hello right here,\u201d he said, putting his arm around Mr. Menendez.\u201cI missed you at breakfast,\u201d Mr. Menendez said.\u201cI was about to say the same thing,\u201d Mr. Scott said as he left. \u201cLook forward to seeing you when you\u2019re back.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Menendez\u2019s trip was brief \u2014 the Senate was only working on Thursday \u2014 and his trial resumes on Tuesday, following the Columbus Day holiday.While Mr. Menendez was clearly happy to be on Capitol Hill, and his step certainly had a more assertive pace than his slower loaf around the fourth floor of the federal courthouse in Newark, he stressed that even during the trial he has been focused on his job.\u201cI\u2019m engaged with senior staff and colleagues as I would if I were physically here talking to them, but I\u2019m talking to them on the phone,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the only thing that is different from what I normally would be doing or not is my ability to cast votes on the committee.\u201dHis listed reason for missing every floor vote: \u201cI was unavoidably absent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Adopts Obama Approach While Seeking to Undo a Legacy", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The president was frustrated. Lawmakers were not passing what he wanted. They were \u201cobstructionists,\u201d he complained. So he took out his pen, signed his name to an order and took action on his own. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a little different route than we had hoped because getting Congress \u2014 they forgot what their pledges were,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers argue that his reliance on executive authority was not a broader strategy but mainly a necessary response to remedy Mr. Obama\u2019s overreach. \u201cThe previous president\u2019s actions were unlawful, unconstitutional, and these actions are largely reversing those actions,\u201d said Raj Shah, the principal deputy White House press secretary.The former president\u2019s champions argue that the current president was fixated only on tearing down rather than building up. \u201cThe fundamental difference is that President Obama used executive action to help the American people, and President Trump is using it to disadvantage large groups of people,\u201d said Bill Burton, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s principal deputy press secretary.But both presidents shared similar impatience with a balky Congress and a desire to take action when stalemated. And they both challenged grousing lawmakers to step up and pass legislation if they did not like it.By his final years in office, Mr. Obama had little hope that Congress would actually do that. But since leaving the White House, he has found that his executive actions were as a result sometimes ephemeral, easily reversed by the next president. Mr. Trump, whose Republican Party controls both the House and Senate, seems to be using his executive power in hopes of forcing lawmakers to act by creating outcomes that he knows many of them would prefer to avoid.In discussing his decision to cancel subsidies to insurance companies, Mr. Trump said on Friday that he hoped to compel Democrats to negotiate a compromise, now that he has failed to pass more sweeping legislation solely on the strength of the narrow Republican majorities. \u201cNow if the Democrats were smart, what they\u2019d do is come and negotiate something where people could really get the kind of health care that they deserve,\u201d he told reporters.\u201cWhat brings us to the table is trying to do some good for people,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. \u201cBut as in the past, threats and bullying is not going to work. In this, politically, he\u2019s in much worse shape than we are. The American people, even a large number of Republicans, are on our side in terms of improving the system, not destroying it. And so I don\u2019t think he has much leverage to threaten or bully.\u201dIn forcing the issue on health care, Mr. Trump may have scuttled bipartisan talks already underway about legislation intended to stabilize the insurance markets under Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. He also scrambled the congressional agenda at a time when lawmakers face several big tests in coming weeks.Congress is already struggling to restore funding for a children\u2019s health care program that expired, and it faces a Dec. 8 deadline to finance government operations across the board. The immigration program will expire in the new year without action, and at some point around then lawmakers will have to increase the debt ceiling or face default.Mr. Trump also faces obstacles to pushing through his major tax cut program by the end of the year. And his Iran decision on Friday starts a 60-day clock for lawmakers to consider reimposing sanctions on Tehran, a move that would effectively blow up the nuclear agreement.Aides to the president said there was no concerted effort to use executive power all at once to move his agenda forward, and that each decision was driven by separate timetables, some of them according to various legal calendars. But they also noted that Congress in recent years has demonstrated that it rarely takes difficult decisions unless it faces deadlines with dire consequences for inaction, such as a government shutdown.Mr. Obama, by contrast, did not turn to executive power so robustly until later in his eight-year presidency, when the opposition was in charge of first the House and then later the Senate. For his first two years, when his own Democrats were in charge of Congress, Mr. Obama passed major legislation like his health care program, a major economic stimulus package and Wall Street regulations.\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is how early in his administration President Trump is resorting to executive unilateralism,\u201d said Mr. Galston, now a Brookings Institution scholar. \u201cThat speaks volumes about the difference between being a majority party and being a governing party, which reflects in part the terms under which Trump won the nomination and the presidency.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

Paulson, the hedge fund manager, and his firm, Paulson & Company, which have invested billions of dollars.\u2022 Samuel Kirschner, the chief operating offer for CPG Real Estate, which has invested in Puerto Rico for nearly 18 years. He has struggled to get into his properties because of damage from the storm.\u2022 Blackstone Group;\u2022 D. E.

But their interests might be aligned with Puerto Rico\u2019s economy as a whole.More from NYT:Tourism supports more than 60,000 jobs in Puerto Rico. Luring deep-pocketed investors from the mainland has the potential to hasten the island\u2019s recovery.At the moment, though, those investors are staring at hard-to-quantify red ink.So far, half of its board has resigned, including:\u2022 Dirk Ziff, the billionaire investor;\u2022 Mark Lasry, the co-founder of the Avenue Capital Management hedge fund;\u2022 Paul Tudor Jones, the hedge fund mogul;\u2022 Tim Sarnoff, the deputy chief executive of Technicolor.What happens next?\u2022 Worth noting: Disney bought Miramax from the Weinstein brothers in 1993 and employed them for 12 years afterward, until they left to form their own studio.The big questionIs there a Weinstein Company without Harvey Weinstein?\u201cWithout Harvey actively managing, the Weinstein Company will become even more capital constrained \u2014 tougher to find funding,\u201d Harold L. Vogel, a media analyst and the author of the book \u201cEntertainment Industry Economics,\u201d wrote in an email on Friday.P. & G.\u2019s battle with Nelson Peltz is already the most expensive in history, with each side having spent at least $60 million in their campaigns. The fight will come down to a shareholder vote on directors that is scheduled for Tuesday \u2014 unless there is a last-minute settlement.What\u2019s at stakeP. & G.\u2019s stock price has languished for the last decade, especially compared to that of its rivals.The election is also the biggest test yet of the power of activist investors like Mr. Peltz who have increasingly influenced major institutional investors.The math behind Tuesday\u2019s voteTo beat back Mr. Peltz, P. & G. needs to make up the difference between the active and retail investors, of some 255 million shares. P. & G. can make that happen only by bringing all three to its side. Vanguard, with 181 million shares, is the largest. State Street owns 115 million and BlackRock 156 million, according to ISS. To put it another way, Mr. Peltz has to win just one of the three. Though that sounds like a tall order for P. & G., past voting records give it a chance. One financial adviser who represents some smaller P. & G. investors suggested that the company may be in for a rough day.\u201cThe restructuring at P. & G. has been going on for 20 years. That\u2019s a long time without much to show for it,\u201d said Mr. Lame, who estimates that the company\u2019s underperformance relative to its category has cost his clients $200 million over the last 10 years. \u201cMaybe you need to have one person on the board who has a different point of view.\u201dThe German lender\u2019s C.E.O., John Cryan, hasn\u2019t yet met with the embattled Chinese conglomerate HNA.That has rattled Mr. Cryan\u2019s chairman, Paul Achleitner, who was an architect of HNA\u2019s purchase of a 9.9 percent stake in Deutsche Bank in March.Two attempts to arrange a meeting between Cryan, 56, and HNA have failed, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the discussion is private. The strategic overhaul announced in March was underpinned by a rights offer that hauled in 8 billion euros ($9.4 billions) for Deutsche Bank.A Deutsche Bank spokesman said of Mr. Cryan, \u201cYes, he hasn\u2019t met him, but of course he will.\u201dWhy you should careGerman and European regulators are reviewing the company, its funding and its Deutsche Bank holding, including what influence HNA might have over the bank as its largest shareholder. The closely held company had faced mounting questions about its ownership and potential ties to the Chinese government as it has ramped up overseas investment.Investors around Wall Street are talking about a research paper from Hendrik Bessembinder of Arizona State University.The entire net gain in the U.S. stock market since 1926 is attributable to the best-performing four percent of listed stocks, as the other ninety six percent collectively matched one-month Treasury bills.The key takeawayThe results help to explain why active strategies, which tend to be poorly diversified, most often underperform.His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.Asked how he would spend the prize money, he replied: \u201cThis is quite a funny question.\u201d He added: \u201cI will try to spend it as irrationally as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Mainland, a Duty to Help Puerto Rico", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySide StreetAfter a month of silence since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Edwin Aponte finally made contact last week with the world beyond his town of Coamo. It came via a Facebook post, a simple check-in from afar that his friends celebrated as if it brought news that they had hit the lottery. Sure, he had no water, power and little food. Nor did he have his apartment, which was flooded.But he had hope.\u201cCoamo was hit hard,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut we will be reborn stronger than ever.\u201dThe devastation is widespread and heartbreaking, he said a few days later by phone. The first glimpse he got of federal emergency workers, he said, was 12 days after the hurricane. Some military rations and a case of water were dropped off at his childhood home on day 33. By then, people were getting desperate, he said, with some resorting to theft while tempers flared over minor dust-ups. Like thousands of other Puerto Ricans, he is leaving for Florida, at least until water and power are restored.\u201cWe are talking so much time and money to do the proper thing,\u201d Mr. Aponte said. \u201cThe Trump administration wants to turn around and put a Band-Aid on this. We need the diaspora to pressure Congress and make sure they step up. Nothing the diaspora does alone can finance what is needed. People have to call their representatives and tell them to vote yes on any bills for Puerto Rico assistance.\u201dMr. Aponte knows about large-scale reconstruction. Before returning to Puerto Rico to help a relative manage several properties, he had spent 25 years on the mainland doing quality control work on major projects like highways, airports and subways. Before that, he had been in the Air Force and, before that, at Yale (where we met in the late 1970s).He is both alarmed at what has happened, and not. The island had already been reeling from a brain drain as a result of an economic crisis triggered by the island\u2019s crippling $73 billion debt. He likened that burden to the economic millstone the French left on their once-enslaved colonial subjects in Haiti after the 1804 independence rebellion. The French demanded 150 million French francs \u2013 later reduced to 90 million francs, or about $40 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2013 in compensation for lost property.\u201cHaiti could never rise above that,\u201d Mr. Aponte, 58, said. \u201cThis is what is happening to Puerto Rico. We have an unpayable debt. I have been saying this for a while, but this is like a third world country.\u201dThis is where the diaspora can help. While the island has a nonvoting member of Congress, stateside Puerto Ricans have voting representatives who can advocate for their concerns, including debt relief, financial aid and the lifting of maritime laws that make imported everyday items more expensive. They can also put pressure on lawmakers to ensure that the rebuilding process is transparent and not a victim of the island\u2019s culture of patronage and back-scratching.The relationship between the two communities has never been a full partnership, said Hector Cordero-Guzm\u00e1n, a professor of public and international policy at Baruch College. \u201cThe island\u2019s political and economic elites have seen the diaspora as a convenient lobbying entity to be activated on behalf of the homeland when the homeland feels it needs them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been a transactional relationship and, at times, paternalistic.\u201dYet, as he and others point out, the diaspora is already helping, not just with rallies, protests and fund-raising events, but by providing direct aid to friends and family on the island \u2014 even taking them in and resettling them in places like Orlando, Fla., or New York City.As he prepared to leave, Mr. Aponte, like many others, wondered if the sluggish and inadequate emergency response was not by design. Land, he said, was now less expensive, and outside investors had been circling even before the hurricane.\u201cFor me, Mother Nature just helped the gringos move forward to where we will be a minority in our own land,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will become Hawaii, an overpriced place controlled by white people while bomba dancers do demonstrations for tourists.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asia Dreams in Skyscrapers", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe skyscraper was born in the United States, but in recent years, it has grown and flourished in Asia. Countries there recognize that to be seen as a player on the global stage, it helps to have tall buildings.Over a century ago, New York and Chicago demonstrated that the skyscraper is, fundamentally, a solution to an economic problem: how to allow for hundreds, if not thousands, of people and businesses to be at the same place at the same time. Urban clustering, especially in a high-tech world, is more important than ever. By promoting density, skyscrapers confer a competitive advantage and allow a city to become a beacon of commerce.An awe-inspiring skyline is a city\u2019s announcement that it is open for business and confident in its future growth. Supertall structures stand as \u201cplace makers\u201d in the planning process, since they create neighborhood landmarks to draw companies, residents, tourists and foreign direct investment. China is now a nation full of capitalists. Arab workers are no longer just oil drillers, but global traders and financiers.But just as important, cities that have record-breaking buildings are not just constructing super-tall monoliths. There is a strong correlation between the number of tall buildings of all sizes and the likelihood a city will have a supertall building; heights and frequencies are strongly related. The Burj Khalifa and Shanghai Tower, for example, are the most visible signs that a city embraces skyscrapers more broadly to enhance economic growth and the quality of life of residents and companies.What is the future of the skyscraper? As long as Asian countries pursue lifestyles similar to that of the West, skyscrapers will continue to be built, as they not only help foster economic growth, but also establish a city\u2019s skyline, which then becomes part of a city\u2019s identity and character.Jason M. Barr, a professor of economics at Rutgers University-Newark, is the author of \u201cBuilding the Skyline: The Birth and Growth of Manhattan\u2019s Skyscrapers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Masayoshi Son\u2019s Grand Plan for SoftBank\u2019s $100 Billion Vision Fund", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Eric Gundersen, the chief executive of a mapping start-up called Mapbox, met Masayoshi Son, the head of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, in late July, he expected to have to sell Mr. Son on what made Mapbox important.\u201cFor Masa, his vision is not just about predictions like the Singularity, which has gotten a lot of hype,\u201d Mr. Gundersen said. \u201cHe understands that we\u2019ll need a massive amount of data to get us to a future that\u2019s more dependent on machines and robotics.\u201dYet the companies all have something in common: They are involved in collecting enormous amounts of data, which are crucial to creating the brains for the machines that, in the future, will do more of our jobs and creating tools that allow people to better coexist.If it ends up being completed, Mr. Son would own significant chunks of ride-hailing companies globally because SoftBank already owns stakes in Uber\u2019s rivals like Didi Chuxing in China and Ola in India. Altogether, SoftBank would have a network of companies that gather valuable logistics data and operate large, connected fleets that could work well with self-driving car technology.\u201cLocation data is central and mission critical to the development of the world\u2019s most exciting technologies,\u201d Rajeev Misra, who helps oversee SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, said about Mapbox in a statement on Tuesday. He added that the investment was part of SoftBank\u2019s plan to put money into \u201cthe foundational infrastructure for the next stage of the Information Revolution.\u201dSoftBank declined to comment further for this article.For more than three decades, Mr. Son has consistently made over SoftBank with acquisitions and investments to keep it on the cutting edge. The company began in 1981 as a PC software distributor in Japan and expanded to the United States in 1994 with the acquisition of the PC trade show operator Comdex.\u201cEvery industry that mankind ever defined and created, even agriculture, will be redefined,\u201d Mr. Son said. \u201cBecause the tools that we created were inferior to mankind\u2019s brain in the past. Now, the tools have become smarter than mankind ourselves.\u201dMr. Son is having many of the same conversations with entrepreneurs these days as he looks to spread investments from the Vision Fund. Many entrepreneurs said Mr. Son\u2019s conversations jumped from philosophical discussions about technology\u2019s impact on humanity to the minutiae of a technical problem.Mr. Son recently told Matt Barnard, the chief executive of Plenty, that computers were ushering in a revolution in agriculture not seen since the invention of the plow. Mr. Son led a $200 million investment in Plenty in July, part of an effort to make it a global leader in indoor farms. Plenty, which has no farms operating at scale, is now planning to open its first farm, in South San Francisco, by the end of the year.\u201cI really do like to believe he likes us a lot,\u201d Mr. Barnard said of Mr. Son. \u201cI\u2019d say the thing we have in common with his other investments is that they are all part of some of the largest systems on the planet: energy, transportation, the internet and food.\u201dSome entrepreneurs travel the globe to spend time with Mr. Son at his palatial home in Woodside, Calif., and his offices in India, San Francisco and Tokyo. The SoftBank chief is known for almost always smiling and speaking slowly. He rarely picks up phone calls, and his email signature includes the whirring fan icon that shows a computer is booting up, or \u201cthinking.\u201dMany of the entrepreneurs speak of Mr. Son with reverence.\u201cOnly people close to him know how huge his vision is,\u201d said Eugene Izhikevich, the chief executive of Brain Corp, a company based in San Diego that makes the software that controls autonomous robots.Mr. Son\u2019s engineers stumbled on Brain Corp when they were looking for self-driving car technology. Mr. Izhikevich was soon seated across from Mr. Son, talking about robotics as well as how Britain operated 200 years ago when the landed gentry did not work, but came up with new inventions and business improvements.Like many other entrepreneurs, Mr. Izhikevich said SoftBank moved \u201cscary fast\u201d to sew up its investment. Mr. Son\u2019s team swarmed Brain Corp\u2019s businesses and spent hundreds of hours on due diligence, wrapping up in a few months.Unlike other investors, Mr. Son, who is already talking about a second Vision Fund, does not insert himself into the day-to-day operations of most of the companies he has invested in. His Sprint deal has yet to pan out and may be dependent on merging with another company. When other investments have lagged, as did his investment in Snapdeal, an online retailer in India, he has invested in competitors, leading a $2.5 billion investment into Flipkart, a rival Indian e-commerce company.Some entrepreneurs said his breakneck investing pace with the Vision Fund was unlikely to slow.\u201cMasa is in a hurry,\u201d said Vijay Sharma, the chief executive of Indian digital payments start-up Paytm, which SoftBank put $1.4 billion into in May. \u201cHe sees this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where everything we touch can become a market, where we\u2019re at the opening up of a new industrial revolution.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
