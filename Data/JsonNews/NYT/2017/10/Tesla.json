{"Headline": "Minus Electrical Grid, Puerto Rico Becomes Generator Island", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 Like many other frivolous things on the island these days, the shiny motorcycles at the Planet Honda showroom have been pushed to the side.In their place are dozens of folding chairs, and on Thursday morning, they were all filled with Puerto Ricans waiting to buy the most essential machines on the post-hurricane landscape: portable generators, to light their powerless homes.\u201cFrom the things I\u2019ve seen with the infrastructure,\u201d she said, \u201cit could be months.\u201dIn a news conference on Friday, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 could not say when the system, which was infamously fragile before the storm, would be fully restored.\u201cThere is no estimated date right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have established, right at the beginning of this week, we want to have 10 percent of the energy generation in Puerto Rico. Now we\u2019re up to 10.6 percent. And our expectation is, within the next month, to have 25 percent.\u201dMany big-box stores and hardware stores are selling out of generators for home use. Julito Ram\u00edrez, the Planet Honda general manager, said that his company was having a hard time keeping up with demand, selling 250 to 300 units per day. After ordering all of the generators he could find in the United States, he has turned to a cache he found in Canada.\u201cWe are in that cycle of finding and bringing, and finding and bringing,\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez said. The generator everyone wants, he said, is a $6,000 model that can run a home air-conditioning system. The biggest model he had in stock this week was a $2,300 machine that can run a refrigerator, some lights, a washing machine \u2014 but not an air conditioner.For one customer, Victor Negr\u00f3n, it would have to do. He said his old generator had given out two days earlier. \u201cI\u2019ve had to go to hotels to charge my phones,\u201d said Mr. Negr\u00f3n, 50, a health care executive. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost all of the food in our refrigerator.\u201dThe Trump administration has asked Congress to approve a $29 billion aid package for Puerto Rico, as well as for hurricane-damaged Florida and Texas. But in the days after September 20, when Hurricane Maria strafed Puerto Rico, Prepa\u2019s money troubles made it \u201calmost impossible\u201d to pay the large contracts required to bring in other states\u2019 power companies to help restore the grid, said Jos\u00e9 E. S\u00e1nchez, a director with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the head of the task force to restore power in Puerto Rico.\u201cIt is not only personnel, but all the trucks and materials,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez said in an email. \u201cThat could cost millions of dollars.\u201dBut Meena Dayak, a spokeswoman for the American Public Power Association, the trade group that coordinates the state-to-state mutual aid networks for public power utilities, said that Prepa never reached out to them for help.\u201cThe way our mutual aid works is we can only go in if help has been requested,\u201d she said over the phone on Friday.Mr. Ramos, Prepa\u2019s chief executive, said he did request help but when none came, he hired a Montana-based company, Whitefish Energy Holdings, to restore many of the power lines. Mr. Ramos said 200 subcontractors were already on the ground.Andy Techmanski, chief executive of Whitefish, said that a shortage of housing for his crews meant that only 75 were on the island, and that clogged ports were making it a challenge to bring in heavy equipment.He also said it would take six months or longer for all of Puerto Rico to have its power restored.But Mr. S\u00e1nchez said that the assignment from the Federal Emergency Management Authority is to repair the system only. \u201cWe are there to repair-replace, but not to augment,\u201d he said.As he waited to buy his generator, Mr. Negr\u00f3n sympathized with the governor. The island needed a better power system, he said. But people did not want to wait. His mother, he said, \u201cwants her electric now.\u201dAcross town at the Costco, Juan Torres, an assistant manager, showed off the massive, truck-size generator that the business, like many here, had installed before the storm. Mr. Torres said it was burning 1,000 gallons of diesel per day.But Mr. Torres said that home generators normally offered at the store were sold out.Across the island, the Army Corps of Engineers has set up 34 huge generators so far, running everything from police departments to water pumping facilities to a Prepa office, according to Lisa Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Corps. Corps officials said on Friday that 177 other generators arrived late in the week, with some of them headed to the United States Virgin Islands.Camilla Feibelman, a founder of the Puerto Rico chapter of the Sierra Club who currently runs the Rio Grande chapter, said that Facebook was full of complaints about the generator noise on the island these days.More seriously, she said, generators can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning when misused \u2014 a common concern among officials in post-storm environments. Last month, three people in Orange County, Fla., died from carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator inside their homes.Adriana Gonz\u00e1lez, a Sierra Club organizer in Puerto Rico, said the high cost of a generator \u201ccreates a disparity\u201d between rich and poor. In her neighborhood, she said, \u201cyou have one house illuminated, and then total darkness for like a block.\u201dMr. Ram\u00edrez, the Honda store manager, said that some generators were stolen from the showroom in the days just after the storm. So the store now makes the sale in the showroom, then has customers pick up their generators from a warehouse a day later.If nothing else, it is a good time to be a generator repairman like Jos\u00e9 Miguel M\u00e1rquez, 35. Mr. M\u00e1rquez said he was so busy these days that the biggest problem is finding time to deposit his checks at the bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Fires Hundreds of Workers", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 The electric-car maker Tesla fired hundreds of workers this week after a series of performance reviews conducted during the biggest expansion in the company\u2019s history.Tesla said Friday that the dismissals were not out of the ordinary, even though they came as the automaker tries to increase the production of its first mass-market vehicle, the Model 3 sedan.The company has been criticized for the slow pace of its early production of the new model, which has generated hundreds of thousands of deposits from prospective buyers.Tesla built about 25,000 vehicles in the three months that ended Sept. 30, but only 260 of those were Model 3s \u2014 considerably fewer than the 1,500 it had projected. The automaker has attributed the low production rate of the new car to unexpected bottlenecks in its manufacturing system.Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has set aggressive targets for the expansion of its plant in Fremont, Calif., including increasing annual production volume to 500,000 vehicles from 100,000.But the firings, which were first reported by The Mercury News, of San Jose, Calif., could indicate that personnel problems have contributed to the early troubles in manufacturing the Model 3.Tesla said in a statement that it regularly conducts annual performance reviews that often result in promotions or bonuses, as well as dismissals.\u201cAs with any company, especially one of over 33,000 employees, performance reviews also occasionally result in employee departures,\u201d the company said. \u201cTesla is continuing to grow and hire new employees around the world.\u201dAlthough Tesla confirmed the dismissals, it did not reveal the exact number of employees who were fired after the reviews.The introduction of the Model 3 is considered a critical turning point in Tesla\u2019s long-term growth plans. Although the company has steadily built a market for its Model S luxury sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle, the Model 3 is expected to broaden its sales considerably.With a sticker price starting about $35,000, the new car is designed to compete with many mainstream, gasoline-powered sedans, as well as electric vehicles produced by much larger automakers such as General Motors and Nissan.A Tesla representative said that the recent dismissals would not have an effect on Model 3 production, and that a \u201cvast majority\u201d of the vacant positions would be filled with new hires.The overall attrition rate of employees will be about the same as last year, the company said.Mr. Musk has described the introduction of the Model 3 as \u201cproduction hell.\u201d But Tesla said in its recent third-quarter production report that it was capable of resolving the issues that had stalled the Model 3. \u201cWe understand what needs to be fixed,\u201d the company said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would You Like My Car to Make You Some Water?", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsA few years ago, Doug Martin, an engineer at Ford, read an article about an unusual billboard in Lima, Peru: It was designed to collect and filter water that condenses on the billboard\u2019s cool surfaces when humid air rolls in from the coast.A short time later, a thought occurred to him: Why couldn\u2019t a car produce drinking water, too? Air-conditioners in cars do something similar to the Peruvian billboard \u2014 generating water by removing moisture from the air. Then he and a Ford colleague, John Rollinger, went about developing a system that dispenses that moisture as cool and filtered drinking water to people inside the vehicle.Now Mr. Martin and Mr. Rollinger are working to turn their system into commercial technology.\u201cThere are people in a lot of locations who don\u2019t have easy access to fresh water \u2014 arid regions, remote regions,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cBut even in a market like the U.S., this might be a feature for people who want to have extremely pure, clean water and don\u2019t want water bottles filling up the landfill.\u201dThe drinking-water idea points to a wider change rippling through the global auto industry: As cars gain more computing power and adopt new technologies, engineers are finding ways to make cars do much more than take us from Point A to Point B.These days, some cars can serve as Wi-Fi hot spots, backup power generators or remote controls for your home. In the future, they might also monitor your health; seat suppliers are tinkering with sensors that can monitor a driver\u2019s heart rate and body temperature.Karl Brauer, a senior director at Kelley Blue Book, the automotive research company, said cars were on a path that resembled the one taken by the iPhone.\u201cWhen the iPhone came out 10 years ago, you could make phone calls and text and access the internet, but no one knew how far it would go with apps,\u201d he said. \u201cCars are going the same way. They are going to serve us in ways and are going to be able to do things that we haven\u2019t even conceived of yet.\u201dMyriad technologies are reshaping what automobiles can do. Most new car are already loaded with computer chips and have wireless communications links, and they are gaining more abilities in those areas every year. Underneath the sheet metal, new cars also usually have fewer mechanical devices and more electronic components than earlier models, a change that allows for advances simply by changing software.All of this is allowing auto engineers to expand their imaginations.That was the case at Ford. After dreaming up his drinking-water idea, Mr. Martin hesitated before entering it into an internal innovation competition. \u201cI thought: This is crazy. I hope nobody laughs at me,\u201d he recalled.But eventually he and Mr. Rollinger ran out to Home Depot and spent about $100 on hoses, tubing and plumbing fittings. They grabbed a standard automotive pump and a water filter, and commandeered a rectangular baking pan from Mr. Martin\u2019s kitchen.\u201cThis was really fun,\u201d Mr. Rollinger said. \u201cIt was like doing a science project in school.\u201dThey devised a way to collect water droplets from an air-conditioner\u2019s condensing coils. Normally that water drains onto the road beneath the car. In their system, the water is run through a filter and then stored in a reservoir.Turn a switch inside the car, and a pump sends water from the reservoir up and out a spout mounted near the front console. The water arrives chilled because it condensed on the cool surfaces of the air-conditioner coils, Mr. Rollinger said.The pair entered the prototype they built into Ford\u2019s innovation contest last year, and it was selected as one of the winners. They have also applied for a patent.For now, they are talking to suppliers and working on the business case for the idea. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful of seeing it go into production,\u201d Mr. Rollinger said.Here\u2019s a look at some other features that cars are starting to offer.\u201cThe kids have tablet and they watch videos on YouTube on all kinds of things,\u201d said Dr. Chandler, an orthopedic surgeon in Greensboro, N.C. \u201cThat keeps them pretty occupied.\u201dSometimes his wife, a pediatrician, connects to the internet to finish up medical reports. \u201cIf we leave on a Friday afternoon, she can bring her laptop and get her work done before,\u201d he said.Several other automakers also offer in-car Wi-Fi and internet connections. For the manufacturers, they are easy add-ons because most modern cars need communication abilities for their navigation systems. General Motors, for example, offers a high-speed 4G link, and many models come with a free three-month trial.\u201cYou have so much electricity production from hydrogen fuel cells that you could use it to power a field hospital, or power tools and provide power relief in a natural disaster,\u201d said Charles Freese, executive director of G.M.\u2019s Global Fuel Cell Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Electric Car and a Rugged Throwback: The Dreams of 2 Rich Britons", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsLONDON \u2014 Two of Britain\u2019s boldest and wealthiest entrepreneurs are trying to break into a very tough league.James Dyson, best known for innovative vacuum cleaners, said recently that he was preparing to introduce a new electric car and had 400 people working on the project. And Jim Ratcliffe, a billionaire petrochemical executive, is so upset about Jaguar Land Rover deciding to end production of the Defender that he said he would put a healthy slice of his fortune into producing what he calls \u201ca spiritual successor\u201d to the classic vehicle of explorers and safaris.These new projects, announced within a couple weeks of each other, sent a burst of excitement through the British car industry, which has been worried about the fallout from Britain\u2019s plans to leave the European Union trading bloc. The Daily Mail, a large circulation tabloid, even said that Dyson\u2019s plans \u201cwould pose a threat to the Silicon Valley giant Tesla.\u201dBut breaking into the car business is far more complex than it might appear at first glance. A new carmaker must design the vehicle and figure out how to manufacture it \u2014 and that is only the beginning. Success requires a number of to-dos: effective marketing, a dealer network and, perhaps, arranging buyer financing.\u201cThere is a huge list,\u201d said Peter Wells, a professor at Cardiff Business School in Wales. \u201cThat has been one of the reasons why the barriers to entry in the automotive industry have been relatively high.\u201dStill, Mr. Wells said that the car industry is \u201cat a very important pivot point in its history now, where a combination of factors are radically altering what is possible.\u201d And Mr. Dyson, 70, and Mr. Ratcliffe, 65, could be in a position to take advantage.New technologies like electric and autonomously driven vehicles are forcing major changes while the center of gravity in the car business is shifting toward Asia. \u201cThere is a lot of fluidity in the entire industry space, which is what these players see,\u201d Mr. Wells said.In an interview at a pub called The Grenadier in London, Mr. Ratcliffe explained that terminating the much-loved Defender would create demand for a replacement because it \u201chad left quite a hole in the marketplace.\u201d He criticized the many SUVs still being sold as \u201cjelly molds\u201d that all look alike.Mr. Ratcliffe owns two versions of the Defender \u2014 one from 1955 and a so-called Heritage model made near the end of its production run. He said he wants to preserve the Defender\u2019s boxy, military-style ruggedness.Toby Ecuyer, a yacht designer, has the job of turning Mr. Ratcliffe\u2019s ideas into drawings. \u201cWhat we are trying to design is something extremely utilitarian,\u201d not a luxury vehicle, he said.Mr. Ratcliffe conceded that the new vehicle will need updates to meet global safety and emission standards, including in the United States, where its sales stopped in 1997. He said he planned to make about 25,000 vehicles a year \u2014 about the number of Defenders sold in 2015, the year before its production was halted.Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata, an India-based conglomerate, has found success with luxury models like the Range Rover. The company said in a statement that it had plans for the Defender and would pay close attention to any actions regarding its \u201cproprietary rights.\u201dMr. Ratcliffe built a $40 billion per year petrochemical empire called Ineos by buying chemical plants that other companies wanted to discard and then running them more efficiently. He said he can also find cheaper ways to operate a car company as well.According to his team, for instance, European manufacturers had already expressed an interest in either building his car on contract or selling him a fully equipped plant. Either way, that would help limit upfront investment and risk. He said he did not want to put in more than 600 million pounds \u2014 less than the $1 billion analysts estimate that development and production of a new model typically costs.Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, director of the CAR center at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said he doubted that an updated version of an old concept would have appeal beyond a dwindling group of enthusiasts. A few would buy Mr. Ratcliffe\u2019s car, he said, but it would \u201cbecome a niche which gets smaller over time.\u201dMr. Dyson has been much more guarded about his plans. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sports car and not a very cheap car,\u201d he told reporters at his company store on London\u2019s bustling Oxford Street in late September. He recounted that in the 1990s he had designed a device for cleaning truck exhaust but received a cool reception from vehicle manufacturers. Instead, he focused his efforts on electric motors and batteries, hoping that one day he could step up to cars.He has reached that point. Mr. Dyson has purchased a World War II-era airfield near his company\u2019s headquarters in Malmesbury, in southern England, where the development work will continue. He said the new vehicle will offer a \u201cradical\u201d electric motor design that he said would be more efficient than those available on the market now.Mr. Dyson has proved himself a dogged inventor, designing high-end vacuum cleaners and other products like hair dryers. His technological savvy gives him a chance of scoring a hit in the much more complex and costly global car industry, analysts said. In 2015, he bought Sakti3, an American start-up that is working with solid state batteries. Mr. Dyson said he could be on track to commercializing a so-called solid state battery, which analysts say might be more powerful and safer than the lithium ion devices now used in electric cars and cellphones. He said both the start-up and his own team were working on the project.\u201cThe edge that Dyson have if they do have an edge is to possibly be ahead of the game in solid state batteries,\u201d said Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank.As nascent as they are, the plans Mr. Dyson has laid out will be expensive, particularly for a medium-size company like Dyson. Mr. Dyson said he would spend \u00a31 billion on the car and another \u00a31 billion on the battery \u2014 a lot of money for a company that reported \u00a32.5 billion in revenue last year.He may need to spend more. Tesla, for instance, has already spent about $6 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates.Mr. Dyson said he planned to develop not only a new motor but a new chassis. \u201cWe are starting from scratch,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one that is suitable.\u201dElectric cars are clearly a high-risk venture. Mr. Houchois said none of the vehicles on the market, including those made by Tesla, which recently reported disappointing production numbers on its new Model 3, are making money for their owners. Dyson may seek to bring costs down by manufacturing in Asia, where it already makes appliances.Still, whatever his reputation, Mr. Dyson has set himself a formidable task. \u201cIt is one thing to design and manufacture a household item,\u201d said R. A. Farrokhnia, a professor at the business and engineering schools at Columbia University. \u201cAnd quite another to prototype and then build a complex electric vehicle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Former Superagent Bets Big on a More Diverse Hollywood", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "The Culture IssueAfter years as the industry\u2019s top African-American talent agent, Charles D. King is building an audacious new production company \u2014 with a vision for bringing long-neglected stories to the screen.Supported byAt the end of a grueling day and a half trying to sell his slate of new projects, Charles D. King \u2014 the 48-year-old founder of a two-year-old media start-up called Macro \u2014 piled with his associates into the back of a black S.U.V. to make his way to the house that was serving as their festival hub. Until recently, King was one of Hollywood\u2019s top agents, the only African-American to make partner at William Morris Endeavor in the firm\u2019s long history. (If you\u2019ve turned on a television, watched a movie or listened to popular music in the past decade, you\u2019ve almost surely witnessed the other side of a deal King brokered.) As difficult as any midcareer job change can be, King\u2019s was an even rarer thing: Starting Macro meant stepping down from a rarefied perch he\u2019d spent his entire professional life fighting to reach. The uncertainty of starting a new business was only compounded by the audacity of King\u2019s vision. He announced Macro not simply as a production house but as an entire media company, one whose content would reflect the new demographics of America \u2014 solving a problem the media industry only fitfully, grudgingly acknowledges is even real.King\u2019s rented bungalow sat at the top of a residential street on a small foothill, but with a blizzard still pummeling the town, the Uber driver found his S.U.V. sliding down the icy grade. Backing up and gunning uphill again only sent the car spinning sideways. After one last halfhearted, face-saving attempt, King and an entourage that included his wife, Stacey Walker King, nodded sympathetically before bundling into their parkas to walk the rest of the way. On the trudge uphill, everyone lashed by the wind and complaining of hunger, King alone seemed enraptured by the falling snow and went loping energetically up the slope, pulling the rest of the party along with his enthusiasm.Macro has made waves with some early projects, like Denzel Washington\u2019s Oscar-nominated film adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s \u201cFences,\u201d but it\u2019s still a new venture, and it has a start-up\u2019s shoot-the-moon sense of urgency and excitement. Inside the house, a boisterous late-night crew \u2014 including several Macro executives and part of the youthful cast and crew of \u201cGente-fied,\u201d a digital project about generational and class tension in the Los Angeles Mexican-American community \u2014 was already joking, decompressing and discussing the day\u2019s films, panels and deal-making. King had brought several titles to the festival, each of them carefully positioned and, so far, enthusiastically received. One of them had become a darling of the festival: Dee Rees\u2019s \u201cMudbound,\u201d a World War II drama about two families from opposite sides of the race line. Still, at 10 p.m., as he sat down to eat, King didn\u2019t have distribution in place for any of his projects. Before starting on the turkey sandwich he\u2019d made himself, he placed two cellphones on the table, next to a glass of sweet tea. \u201cIt\u2019s an old agent\u2019s trick,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou always carry two phones, in case one dies or loses reception.\u201dIn his past life as an agent, King carried no real financial risk: Agents are paid a percentage of the deals they negotiate. As the founder of a media company, each deal he strikes has a material impact not only on his own fate but also on those of his employees and investors. Perhaps the most formidable obstacle to Macro\u2019s success is a body of received wisdom about why the world on our screens looks so different from the real world it ostensibly mirrors \u2014 ideas about how films starring black actors don\u2019t do as well in crucial overseas markets, or that Hollywood has no bias against women, or that Asian men can\u2019t be leading men. There are countless claims like these, almost all of them unsubstantiated, tautological or otherwise self-serving. King\u2019s project is to break down these barriers, and he exudes a quiet confidence in his vision: that there is vast cultural and economic opportunity in telling meaningful stories to diverse audiences. He describes this effort as \u201ca front in the civil rights battle.\u201d Past generations marched for things the law could do, like dismantling housing segregation or securing voting rights. King wants to accomplish something the law cannot: using film to fill in the subtle degrees of experience that reveal our lives to one another. When people look at all the ubiquitous screens that surround us, King wants us to see ourselves. Not only African-Americans, but everyone.In King\u2019s own career, breaking down barriers has meant keeping cool and taking his lumps \u2014 some of them simply for being an outsider \u2014 as he studied the business and fought his way up from a subminimum-wage position in the William Morris mailroom. Macro is the culmination of his life\u2019s work and the realization of dreams he has nursed since he was just another scrawny kid in Georgia. If the projects the company champions do well, then King, and everything he serves, will do well, too. If not, he will have made a life-defining miscalculation. So as the rest of Park City partied or slept, King swiveled back and forth between his sandwich and his phones. His face, which has a boyish enthusiasm when he\u2019s excited, turns profoundly focused when he considers the business aspect of things; in unguarded moments he sometimes looks as beatific as a Dostoyevsky character. You get the sense of a man whose neural network is wired differently \u2014 so much so that I felt compelled to ask his wife, Stacey, about these reveries when I ran into her in the Salt Lake City airport. \u201cOh, you saw that?\u201d she asked. \u201cCharles daydreams. He stares into space. I didn\u2019t understand at first. Now I get it. He\u2019s processing, making connections. There\u2019s a real vision there.\u201dYet each of those recent success stories was an independent production, with origins outside the clubby confines of Hollywood studios. Making film and television is an expensive gamble, and when the people making the wagers all come from a single demographic, the only certainty is that their own point of view will always be well represented. \u201cIt think it\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d says the ICM agent Andrea Nelson Meigs, whose clients include Beyonc\u00e9 and Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis. \u201cPeople buy what they relate to. People buy what they\u2019re familiar with. If the person behind the desk doesn\u2019t relate to the experience of the person in front of it, it\u2019s 50-50.\u201d She illustrated this with a story from her own office, where she was surprised to learn that of several young assistants, only one, an African-American woman, was aware of the iconic activist Angela Davis, the subject of a potential biopic. \u201cIf that\u2019s the room we\u2019re pitching,\u201d Nelson Meigs says, \u201cthat story doesn\u2019t get made.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t help that Hollywood relies on tweaking proven formulas, meaning any filmmaker without successful antecedents they can use to back up their ideas will face high hurdles. The one area where African-Americans have found relatively consistent recent success in the industry has been the popular work of directors like Lee Daniels, F. Gary Gray or Tyler Perry, to which audiences flock for the same reason whole neighborhoods once gathered around the television: because they will see themselves on the screen, and because they know they will not feel insulted by what they see. It has not been easy to secure even that much, let alone opportunities to make more psychologically and artistically ambitious films. \u201cWhen I started it was the age of Spike Lee,\u201d says Poppy Hanks, Macro\u2019s senior vice president for production, who attended the University of Southern California at the same time as John Singleton, and whose early career coincided with the commercial success of movies like \u201cSoul Food\u201d (which she worked on) and \u201cWaiting to Exhale.\u201d \u201cThere was just a wave that gave us a sense it was all possible.\u201d As she made her way into the business, though, she saw how difficult it could be to push such films through the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s always shocking to them when something succeeds,\u201d she says. \u201cNot to us, but to them.\u201dKing\u2019s career has spanned both reliable franchises like the \u201cBarbershop\u201d movies and more ambitious films like \u201cFruitvale Station.\u201d He understands what pleases crowds, but he also understands the narrowness of current cinema and the pent-up creative energies outside it. \u201cThe specific message I want to resonate,\u201d he says, \u201cis people of color have stories to tell.\u201d Part of this conviction comes from his youth, when he watched his mother try to publish the novel she worked on every day after coming home, only to be met with rejection by industry gatekeepers. \u201cI remember the impact that had on her,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made her question whether she was a gifted writer, and she was.\u201d He does not say it, but it is clear in his tone that he still thinks the rejections had less to do with merit than with other forces. The business of culture is one of the most subjective in American society, and its executive suites are all filled with unintentional, unexamined biases. Added together, those biases can still accomplish nearly the same ends as the outright aggression directed at people of color a century ago. There was no animus toward King\u2019s mother. They simply couldn\u2019t see her, or her story.After Vanderbilt, King enrolled at the historically black Howard University for law school. It was a summer internship at MTV that gave him his first real exposure to the media industry, and it was while living in 1990s New York that he met Stacey Walker, a 22-year-old recent Duke graduate. She recalls their first meeting as anything but fateful: She was leaving a party with friends, and King and his friends were on their way in, an encounter he claimed not to remember when they ran into each other again shortly afterward. Nonetheless, they were soon dating seriously. He moved to Los Angeles a year later; after a year and half, Stacey joined him. They\u2019ve been together some 20 years.\u201cWhile all the sons and daughters of studio heads were out with each other, I would stay behind and talk to Rick,\u201d King recalls \u2014 meaning Rick Palacio, the assistant supervisor of the mailroom. Despite the meager pay, King saw the mailroom as \u201ca gold mine\u201d of information and possibility. He was promoted to assistant on the desk of an agent, then quickly removed. \u201cI was not a great assistant,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was too focused on the big picture. What I really needed to learn was that paying your dues was more than going through the motions.\u201d When he found himself with a second shot in the mailroom, he redoubled his efforts: \u201cI was going to get fired or promoted.\u201dHe credits the firm\u2019s African-American clients \u2014 and their managers and other assorted \u201cpeople\u201d \u2014 with making sure it was the promotion. He may have been a junior employee, but some bigger industry players gravitated toward him, in part because he understood their clients\u2019 value in ways others in the agency did not. He also had a talent for building community. \u201cBecause there are so few people of color, we all know each other,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cThere was an unspoken locking of the arms. We were all kids figuring it out. I don\u2019t even know if Charles knows this, but I know both my bosses were putting pressure on his bosses to promote him.\u201dEventually, King says, \u201cthere was a groundswell\u201d of people lobbying his cause. In 2000, he escaped the mailroom for good. Still, there were many within the office who \u201cwere sniggering at the things I was suggesting,\u201d he remembers. One such incident, which I first heard about from Mike Palank, his assistant at the time and now an executive at Macro, concerned a weekly meeting in which agents at William Morris speculated about how the firm\u2019s movie openings would do in each weekend\u2019s box office. The week before one of King\u2019s projects opened, he attended expectantly, only to find his client\u2019s movie wasn\u2019t even on the agenda. He was vindicated by Monday morning, when the receipts were counted \u2014 and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cDiary of a Mad Black Woman\u201d turned out to have the highest gross in the country.Agents negotiate between talent and money. They can connect, nurture and translate, but the ultimate decision-making power lies elsewhere. With Macro, finally, the decisions are King\u2019s. He has designed the company with great care: Macro is situated at the intersection of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, combining the core elements of a production company with an aggressive focus on digital platforms. The companies King cites as similar to Macro include both content behemoths like Vice and nimble midsize production companies like Legendary, whose movies \u2014 including \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d \u2014 punch above their weight. Shortly after I saw him at Sundance, \u201cMudbound\u201d won the largest distribution deal of any movie at the festival. \u201cGente-fied\u201d ignited a bidding war among six networks. \u201cFences\u201d won an Oscar for Viola Davis. Maybe most remarkable, King closed a second round of funding \u2014 just announced in recent days \u2014 to the tune of $150 million. \u201cI think there\u2019s an enormous hunger for these stories,\u201d says one lead investor, Laurene Powell Jobs, who has known King since they worked together on the board of a nonprofit. \u201cHe\u2019s at the forefront. All of us who saw something special in Charles are just seeing what he\u2019s capable of.\u201dStacey has known longer than most. \u201cCharles told me he was going to build a media company on our first date,\u201d she says. \u201cThings never look exactly as you imagine them, but it\u2019s what he always said he wanted to do.\u201d King plans to produce or co-produce between four and six films a year, with a maximum investment of $35 million, in addition to \u201cat least three shows on streaming, or television and cable,\u201d an unspecified number of digital shows and a portfolio of investments in pure technology companies. Projects in development include another project with Washington, as well as collaborations with Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, Van Jones, Eva Longoria and Justin Simien. \u201cCharles and I have been fighting this fight for 18 years,\u201d says Hanks, one of Macro\u2019s first hires. \u201cI know we\u2019ve done really well. Now we have to keep it up.\u201dThe offices are in a rapidly transforming corridor of Los Angeles. The work of up-and-coming artists adorns the walls; the soundtrack is classic rap, and the work force looks as harmoniously multicultural and gender-balanced as America imagines itself. These employees aren\u2019t just betting their fates on the movie business but on interlocking shifts in demographics, culture and technology. Macro, King believes, is in the vanguard of a new cultural universe, one made possible by the shrinking space between technology and film. \u201cWe\u2019re building a global company for a new majority. We won\u2019t be the only one.\u201d He begins listing mighty firms that fell (MGM, Blockbuster, Time Warner), noting new entities that sprang up seemingly from nowhere (Netflix) and theorizing what the landscape may look like decades from now \u2014 before going abruptly silent, to keep from tipping too much of his own hand. \u201cWell, you can imagine,\u201d he concludes, cutting across several lanes of rush-hour traffic on the freeway after missing an exit.King is not the first to see the problem of diversity in popular culture; it has been apparent since the beginning, and like every struggle for equality in this post-civil rights country, in this post-colonial world, it has been a generation-over-generation battle. His challenge to us \u2014 to imagine new cultural possibilities \u2014 also challenges the sense everyone in the old order has of being an expert about the culture. What if the world we think we know is only a tiny, myopic fraction of it? What if the things we believe we understand are nothing but learned patterns? We imagine that wanting to be inclusive and cosmopolitan makes us so, but we continue to be produced by and inhabit the structures that create oppression. This is precisely what makes it so important that Hollywood be truly democratic: It represents so much of the inner, the hidden and exceptional, of this country. If there is no space for the visions of the most talented among us no matter where they come from \u2014 or how strange their ideas may seem to those who cannot comprehend them \u2014 what possible future can we really have but the most ordinary?As the sun set, King piloted his Tesla noiselessly down the 101, oblivious to the way he was disrupting traffic. He finished his final call of the day in the last amber hour of light on this side of the Pacific, and I watched him stare intently into the distance behind his sunglasses in the silent interior of the car. White-knuckling the corner of my seat, something Stacey said returned to me \u2014 his processing, his making connections. I understood he was dreaming.Calvin Baker teaches at Columbia University and is the author of four novels, including \u201cGrace\u201d and \u201cDominion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re watching the unlikely career resurrection of Klaus Kleinfeld, who will oversee a $500 billion economic development zone in Saudi Arabia. More on that in a moment.It took Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tiebreaking vote that struck down the ability of Americans to file class-action lawsuits against financial institutions. But Republicans had long opposed the move against arbitration clauses that had been proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it would have led to frivolous lawsuits and driven up credit card interest rates.In recent months, financial firms and their Republican allies in Congress mobilized to defeat the rule. Some credit unions and community banks also weighed in, lodging calls to lawmakers in their home states.What people are saying about the voteSome at the conference were floored that Mr. Kleinfeld had clearly landed on his feet with such large responsibility and oversight.

{"Headline": "In Self-Driving Race, Waymo Sets Its Own Terms", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftATWATER, Calif. \u2014 A self-driving car is not a self-driving car is not a self-driving car.That is the message Waymo, the autonomous vehicle division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, tried to send on Monday, when it invited a group of reporters to visit Castle, a facility in California\u2019s Central Valley that it has been using as a training course for its self-driving vehicles.Castle, which is built on a decommissioned Air Force base roughly 120 miles from San Francisco, resembles a miniature city, with many of the realistic elements a self-driving car might encounter on the road \u2014 like cul-de-sacs, traffic signals and a smattering of potholes. Waymo has been putting its test vehicles through their paces here since 2013, and conducting some 20,000 tests of different road situations. And on Monday, the company was offering rides in its latest prototype, a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with a cluster of sensors and cameras.But first, John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, wanted to give a vocabulary lesson.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about self-driving,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion about what the terminology means.\u201d He rattled off a list of terms that have been used to describe vehicles with varying levels of self-driving ability: autonomous, driverless, semiautonomous, fully self-driving, partially autonomous, semi-driverless.\u201cIt\u2019s really a bit of a problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.If Mr. Krafcik seems annoyed, it\u2019s because the self-driving hype cycle is running at full volume these days, with companies from Uber to General Motors to Tesla noisily promoting their progress toward autonomous vehicles.It\u2019s hard to know where this all ends. Will the winner be the company that develops a vehicle capable of driving along a preprogrammed route, in ideal weather conditions, in certain cities? Or will it be the vehicle that can drive itself anywhere, rain or snow? Is it enough to build a vehicle that drives itself most of the time, or is a truly driverless car one in which the passenger can safely take a nap? Does it count if a company produces just a handful of expensive prototype vehicles, rather than something that can be mass-produced and sold by the tens of thousands?Waymo has set a narrow target. It is aiming for Level 4 autonomy, an official classification for a vehicle that is capable of driving itself, with no human behind the wheel, in most environments and road conditions. It believes that nothing short of Level 4 counts as autonomous, and that bypassing Level 3 (a lower classification, in which some human attention is still required) is necessary to keep people safe on the roads. Humans, the company says, can easily lose concentration while driving with Level 3 autonomy, even though they often need to take over at a moment\u2019s notice.That is also a self-serving goal. By most estimations, Waymo is closer than any other company to Level 4 autonomy. Its test vehicles, which have been on the road for eight years, have completed more than 3.5 million autonomous miles, far more than any of its competitors. It has driven another 2.5 billion miles in \u201cCarcraft,\u201d a simulated, virtual-reality environment that allows the company to run and rerun various situations millions of times a day, and incorporate the results into its real-world vehicles. And its access to Google\u2019s top-tier engineering talent and cutting-edge technical infrastructure has made it a formidable competitor.Waymo\u2019s advantage was apparent on Monday, during my test ride in the company\u2019s self-driving minivan. Unlike other driverless demos I\u2019ve encountered, there was no human keeping watch at the wheel. To start the trip, a colleague in the back seat pressed a large blue button marked \u201cstart ride,\u201d and the van took off on its own. In a 10-minute drive around Castle, it easily handled a series of different on-road situations and obstacles. It encircled a roundabout, waited patiently for pedestrians to cross the street, and dodged traffic cones and bicyclists with ease. It felt slick and polished, and gave the sense that it might be ready for public consumption very soon.Granted, this was a carefully planned test loop in a controlled environment. Autonomous driving on public roads is a much harder challenge, and Waymo is still figuring out how best to deploy its technology to a wider market. The company declined to put a date on when it might release self-driving cars to the general public, and Mr. Krafcik spoke only in generalities about its plans, saying that it would focus on ride-hailing and autonomous trucking as possible early business models.\u201cWe\u2019re really close,\u201d he said.Waymo\u2019s victory against this army of well-funded competitors is not guaranteed. But it won\u2019t be easy to beat, especially if it gets to define what winning means.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Plant in China May Be a First", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Tesla and other manufacturers, their production options in China are limited by the government. One option is to set up a joint venture, sharing much of their technology and profits with a Chinese partner. The other is to manufacture in in China, protecting their secrets but forking over steep tariffs.Carmakers usually end up in a joint venture. That Tesla is striking a different deal reflects China\u2019s global ambitions to dominate the electric car industry.The company has a preliminary deal with the Shanghai municipal government that would give Tesla ownership of its facility, two people familiar with the negotiations said on Sunday.The operation would be located inside a free-trade zone, said the two people, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks. Being inside a foreign trade zone means that unless Tesla can negotiate a special exemption, the cars could still be subject to China\u2019s steep tariffs \u2014 treated as though they were still being shipped from outside China even though they were being produced in the country.The preliminary deal still offers Tesla control over its trade secrets and may give the company leverage to negotiate better terms with the Chinese government in the future. Tesla hopes to complete the deal by the end of the year, the two people said.Any comprehensive arrangement would still require the approval of the central government in Beijing. The Beijing authorities have sometimes used their power to delay deals or demand further concessions from foreign investors.Persuading Tesla to build cars in Shanghai while still paying tariffs on them would be a coup for the Chinese government. If Tesla were making cars in the Shanghai area, it would have a powerful incentive to buy many, if not most, of the parts in China, strengthening China\u2019s base of suppliers for the fast-growing electric car industry.The gap may widen. LMC predicts that China\u2019s total will nearly triple in the next two years, while the rest of the world\u2019s will merely double. That is because, in part, Chinese government regulations will require automakers starting in 2019 to sell ever-increasing numbers of electric cars and plug-in hybrids if they want to keep selling gasoline cars. China has also begun research on imposing a rule to ban the sale of internal combustion cars someday.\u201cChina is and will be the largest consumer and producer of electric vehicles in the world,\u201d said Bill Russo, the founder and chief executive of Automobility, a Shanghai consulting firm. \u201cIf Tesla hopes to compete as a global electric vehicle maker, it must tap the manufacturing and supply footprint of China in order to compete globally.\u201dChina has the steepest barriers to automotive trade of any large market in the world, making it difficult to compete in the Chinese market without producing in the country. Beijing has been able to retain steep tariffs and other obstacles to imports because it insisted that it was a developing country when it entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.The W.T.O. has allowed developing countries to retain much higher trade barriers than industrialized countries, on the theory that they have infant industries that may not have grown big enough to withstand global competition. Today, however, China has the world\u2019s largest auto industry.Unlike these taxes, the costs of shipping a car across the Pacific are tiny. They can be as little as 1 percent of the cost of a high-priced model like Tesla\u2019s offerings. \u201cShipping costs are usually not a big deal \u2014 it is the 25 percent tariff\u201d that keeps out imports, said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm.Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has expressed concern about China\u2019s trade practices. President Trump is set to visit Beijing from Nov. 8 to 10, but China has shown little sign of willingness to negotiate on sectors that it regards as strategic imperatives, and electric cars are one such industry.If the deal does come to pass, Tesla would have achieved a breakthrough of sorts in being preliminarily allowed to have a wholly owned operation in a foreign trade zone. Honda also received permission to set up a majority owned operation in a foreign trade zone more than a decade ago, but unlike Tesla, it has been forced to export the output from that factory, mainly to Europe.The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Tesla had a deal to produce cars in Shanghai. The Shanghai government declined to comment on the status of the talks with Tesla.Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Natalie Kitroeff from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Tiered Pricing Is a Hurdle, but a Fair One", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewA simple, over-the-air change in that code could instantly render the two cars\u2019 battery output \u2014 and cruising range \u2014 identical. Yet the sticker price for the unrestricted model was thousands of dollars higher. (The company also offered variants of its Model X sport utility vehicle on similar terms.)Tesla was transparent in its portrayal of its offerings. It told buyers that the premium prices for the unrestricted models were for software upgrades that unlocked the potential of the discount models\u2019 batteries. Buyers who chose premium models might reasonably be viewed as having made voluntary contributions to the company\u2019s development costs.If Tesla had charged the same price to every buyer, smaller sales volumes would have required that price to have been even higher than for the premium models. Uniform pricing would have resulted in a worse outcome not only for the company but also for its customers.That\u2019s why it\u2019s a disservice to call Tesla\u2019s practice price discrimination. That label makes it almost impossible for neutral observers to approve.As psychologists have long known, sounds that reach our ears provoke at least a weak valence \u2014 an emotional reaction to their intrinsic attractiveness or unpleasantness. \u201cPuppy\u201d evokes a positive valence, for example, while \u201csnake\u201d evokes a negative one.Psychologists also explain that once we\u2019ve experienced an initial valence, we activate a cognitive filter that tends to reinforce that assessment. If we react negatively upon first meeting someone, for instance, we tend to interpret ambiguous signals received during further interactions with that person as confirming our initial appraisal.Is discrimination good or bad? For most people, the term evokes a strong negative valence. Any action bearing the label \u201cdiscrimination\u201d is destined to be viewed with initial skepticism \u2014 and with increasing disdain as time passes. That\u2019s unfortunate in this case, because the consequences of Tesla\u2019s pricing practices are completely benign.Want a new stove? You can wait for the scratch-and-dent sales that occur periodically, or you can buy one right away at list price. A new blender? You can pay sticker price, or get a nice discount by mailing in a rebate coupon. In Tesla\u2019s case, you could pay list price for an unrestricted car, or pay substantially less by tolerating the shorter range of a restricted model.From the seller\u2019s perspective, the ideal hurdle is one that only price-sensitive buyers are willing to jump. Such hurdles enable sellers to expand their sales by offering significant discounts without having to cut prices for everyone. Once you\u2019ve spotted a few examples of the hurdle method in action, you will see it everywhere. You may even have trouble finding sellers who do not engage in some variant of the practice.Because production is increasingly accompanied by large fixed research and development costs, differential pricing is becoming increasingly important. As the Duke University economist Philip Cook and I wrote in our 1995 book, \u201cThe Winner-Take-All Society,\u201d roughly 80 percent of the cost of a computer in 1984 was in its hardware, and 20 percent in its software. Only six years later, that proportion was reversed, and this trend has intensified sharply since then.Sellers with high fixed costs cannot remain solvent if they charge each buyer only a small markup over the cost of producing additional units. To cover fixed development costs, some buyers must pay substantially more than marginal cost.Who better to shoulder that burden? The hurdle method allows buyers who care most about a product\u2019s special features to identify themselves by their refusal to jump the seller\u2019s hurdle. That those buyers end up paying a larger share of the product\u2019s development costs is both fair and economically efficient.Why discourage this practice by giving it a label certain to make people dislike it? Without effective ways to engage in differential pricing, many of the product design features that buyers care most about would quickly disappear.Advertisement"}

I promise you I will give you more as we go on in the next few days or next few weeks. Do you think that her age \u2014 84 \u2014 should be an issue?Absolutely not. Her problem isn\u2019t age, but where she stands on the key issues that the voters care about. Ideas and values and priorities.What issues do you differ with her on? Is Trump one of them?My record is very clear on where I have stood with regards to Donald Trump and how he is a clear and present danger to economic prosperity, to progressive values and to our people.

Stroz also found texts between Levandowski and former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick about recruitment efforts and working with Uber\u2019s self-driving arm dating back to as early as February and March 2016 \u2014 just weeks after Levandowski left Alphabet and launched Otto out of stealth.After leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski said he found a data storage container in his house containing \u201csource code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars,\u201d according to the report, information that Mr. Levandowski said he downloaded as a matter of \u201chis departure from ordinary course of business.\u201dInvestigators also found evidence of photos of Google self-driving car designs, whiteboard sketches and pictures of hardware and electronic components stored on Mr. Levandowski\u2019s iPhone.Jo Bertram, the regional manager for Uber in Northern Europe, has announced her departure just as the new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is in London to meet with the city\u2019s transportation authorities over their decision not to renew Uber\u2019s license.Given some of our current challenges, I\u2019m also convinced that now is the right time to have a change of face, and to hand over to someone who will be here for the long haul and take us into the next phase. While I would like to have announced my move in smoother circumstances, I\u2019m proud of the team we\u2019ve built here and am very confident in their abilities to lead the business into the next chapter.Ms. Bertram, who will continue for a few weeks to help with the transition, has been a key contact between Uber and Transport for London.She has been involved in negotiating on a range of regulatory questions, from streamlining the licensing process to securing permission for new Uber services in London.Her directorship was terminated on August 30, according to a Companies House filing, a few weeks before TfL officially notified Uber about its license, although Uber told the press at the time that this was related to an earlier role change.The debate is heating up as Procter & Gamble edges toward one of the largest proxy votes in history, on Oct. 10.Mr. Taylor made another plea to shareholders this week via a video, asking them not to vote for Mr. Peltz.Nelson Peltz would seek to fundamentally change the soul of our company. He wants us to go to a holding company in 3 separate businesses. He said corporate R&D is a hobby. It\u2019s not a hobby. It\u2019s fundamental to our brands and the processes that make our brands.To get an idea of what the P&G trio might be grilled on, here are some of the questions drawn up by Bernstein:\u2022 On the one hand PG has said that Peltz\u2019s new structure would be too costly; on the other hand PG has said Peltz is trying to fire loads of people, especially in Cincinnati. Which is it? What, specifically, is so wrong with Peltz\u2019s org plan if many other companies are run this way too and have done better than PG over the past decade?\u2022 Didn\u2019t Meg Whitman benefit from activist Ralph Whitworth on her board at HP? Why is this different?Goldman Sachs is considering betting on Bitcoin, soon after JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon called it a fraud.Goldman, which is considering a new trading operation dedicated to digital currencies, would be the first blue-chip Wall Street firm to deal directly in this market, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. Although banks have looked at using blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, they have been wary of wading directly into the market.Goldman\u2019s effort involves both its currency-trading division and the bank\u2019s strategic investment group, the people said. That suggests the firm believes bitcoin\u2019s future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold.Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood executive and co-founder of DreamWorks Animation, is trying to raise money for a television start-up and he\u2019s doing it on a scale that dwarfs the kind of money raised by the likes of Facebook, Netflix and Uber.Virtually every large media and technology company, as well as several private equity firms, have shown some interest.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s idea? Premium quality content in short form, like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with a narrative arc of 10 minutes.\u201cI would actually make the argument that one of the challenges for network TV has been that they\u2019ve actually busted the form by asking people to watch 19 minutes of commercial time inside of 60 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-two percent of your watch time is watching commercials.\u201d\u201cThis idea that Apple and Facebook and YouTube are now coming into Hollywood with these billions of dollars and are in fact going to change the enterprise of television is actually wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything new or different or unique.\u201dThe ad agency is preparing to lock horns with Bain Capital after the private equity firm launched a $1.3 billion tender offer for Asatsu-DK, Japan\u2019s third-biggest advertising agency and a long-term business partner of WPP.Just hours after Bain\u2019s offer was made public, people close to WPP said on Monday night that it did not intend to sell its 24.7 per cent stake in Asatsu-DK (ADK) at the \u00a53,660 price offered by Bain, as the tender \u201cseverely undervalues\u201d the Japanese firm.Advertisement"}

Friend in Tow", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesAnd Kirsch is right. Millions of people learn of his shocking, religion-flouting ideas. Entire belief systems are thrown into jeopardy. Action is triggered \u2014 the kind that sends Brown\u2019s hunky, beloved Harvard symbology professor, Robert Langdon, chasing all over Spain on Kirsch\u2019s trail, accompanied by the inevitable beautiful and brilliant woman. As one admirer says to Langdon, the full flap this generates \u201creminds me of the Vatican denouncing your book \u2018Christianity and the Sacred Feminine,\u2019 which, in the aftermath, promptly became a best seller.\u201dNo need to be so modest. The book the Vatican fought in real life was \u201cThe Da Vinci Code.\u201d It sold tens of millions of copies in dozens of languages, and has led to Brown\u2019s selling hundreds of millions of books (not to mention movie tickets) around the world. The voice speaking to Langdon about his popularity is that of Winston, Kirsch\u2019s A.I. avatar. Winston\u2019s sensibilities are so highly developed that he sounds wiser than most people \u2014 which is a good thing, since he has to lead Langdon to many of the hoops through which \u201cOrigin\u201d makes him leap.Does anyone think Kirsch will get through 100 pages of introductory fanfare and make his big announcement unscathed?Now Langdon, still in tails, dashes out of the museum alongside its director, the beautiful Ambra Vidal. She happens to be the fianc\u00e9e of Spain\u2019s Prince Julien, who will soon be king. (Brown has made up his own Spanish royal family.) Her clout, Kirsch\u2019s money and Winston\u2019s disembodied smarts empower the two runaways to go anywhere in their search for \u2026 what? Touristy sites to keep the book interesting, for starters. Barcelona is big on the agenda because its Gaudi architecture eerily embodies Kirsch\u2019s theories about the intersection of science and nature; because it poses fabulous challenges to Brown\u2019s fascination with logistics; and because everyone seems to have forgotten how hard it is for a man wearing tails to clamber all over the place without getting tied up in knots.But in the world of quantum computing, where Kirsch\u2019s earlier pioneering work had broken boundaries, the divine was harder to apprehend. The book\u2019s final destination reveals the essence of what Kirsch saw and created, and it inspires awe. Getting there is worth the roundabout journey.Part of the fun in reading Brown comes from not taking him too seriously as a stylist. He brings to mind Joseph Heller\u2019s Yossarian in \u201cCatch-22,\u201d who has the job of censoring letters and turns it into an arbitrary game. There are Brown sentences that could happily lose their modifiers: \u201cThe grisly memory was mercifully shattered by the chime of the jangling bar door.\u201d There are phrases that beg you to ask friends to fill in the blanks: \u201cClear and penetrating, ____ _ ____.\u201d (Like a bell.) There\u2019s an air of overstatement that\u2019s more gleeful than egregious, but it can\u2019t be mistaken for good. And the hyperbole is sometimes the stuff of giggles: \u201cI am not exaggerating when I tell you that my discovery will have repercussions on the scale of the Copernican revolution.\u201d If Brown didn\u2019t mean that, his books wouldn\u2019t be so well worth waiting for.Brown loves winking at Langdon, the literally dashing version of himself, and inviting readers to share the joke. And for all their high-minded philosophizing, these books\u2019 geeky humor remains a big part of their appeal. Not for nothing does Kirsch\u2019s Tesla have a license plate frame reading: \u201cTHE GEEKS SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH.\u201d Brown continues to do everything in his playful power to ensure that will happen.Advertisement"}

That is forcing automakers from Detroit to Yokohama and Seoul to Stuttgart to pick up the pace of transformation or risk being left behind in the world\u2019s largest car market.\u201cWe are seeing ourselves at a crossroads in the development of the automobile industry in this country, with a global scale in mind,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Stackmann, Volkswagen\u2019s top executive for VW brand sales and marketing, during a visit to Shanghai.This, however, would be on a different scale.Already, China is the world\u2019s largest maker and seller of electric cars. Chinese buyers are on track to snap up almost 300,000 of them this year, three times the number expected to be sold in the United States and more than the rest of the world combined.Electric cars are an increasingly common sight in cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. For some drivers here, electric cars are all they know.\u201cI don\u2019t plan to buy a gasoline car, since I heard they are going to be banned for sale,\u201d said Xiong Jianghuai, a lawyer based in Shanghai, who has bought two made by Chery, a Chinese automaker. He said he was delighted that the operating cost was less than one-fifth of the cost of buying gasoline, even if the initial purchase price was a little higher.\u201cI think the future lies in electric cars,\u201d Mr. Xiong said.Chinese auto executives say their country is pursuing common-sense policies to develop cutting-edge industries.Chinese officials have long called for electric cars to be practical, and not just luxuries.\u201cThe central government has made a lot of strategies for the development of new energy vehicles,\u201d said Song Qiuling, a deputy director at China\u2019s Finance Ministry. \u201cThat is why we have seen the progress and development of new energy vehicles.\u201dThe environmental benefits may be tough to realize any time soon. Nearly three-quarters of China\u2019s power comes from coal, which emits more climate-changing gases than oil. Even on electricity, China\u2019s cars are still burning dirty.China is also favoring battery electric technology that it can call its own. Foreign automakers already control much of the advanced technology behind fuel-sipping alternatives such as plug-in hybrids, like the Toyota Prius, which runs on both gasoline power and an electric battery.Still, electric cars make particular sense in China. China\u2019s dense and crowded cities often mean shorter driving distances, while its extensive high-speed rail system reduces the need for long-distance road trips.Han Tao discovered the limits of electric cars the hard way. A 35-year-old stock investor in Beijing, he said he ran out of charge in July while driving to Shenzhen, 1,300 miles away. His Chinese-made BYD E6 electric sedan needed a tow.Still, he said, he and his wife prefer the E6 over the gasoline-powered Chevrolet Cruze they bought four years earlier.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the oily smell and the noise from the engine,\u201d Mr. Han said. \u201cIt accelerates way faster than gasoline cars. It feels like you are on a high-speed train.\u201dWen Jiabao, China\u2019s second-most-powerful official as premier from 2002-12, was an avid supporter of electric cars who came from Tianjin, the center of China\u2019s battery industry. Mr. Wen\u2019s successor as premier, Li Keqiang, has also turned government backing for high-tech industries into his signature accomplishment, while President Xi Jinping has strongly endorsed the effort.\u201cThe development of new energy vehicles,\u201d said Xu Chaoqian, a top aide to Mr. Wan, \u201chas received a lot of support from President Xi, Premier Li and others.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang in Shanghai and Adam Wu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Find a sofa that complements concrete.At least that was the solution adopted by the Fortis Property Group, the developer of six new townhouses in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn that were first listed in April. Fortis filled one of the unfinished concrete shells with luxury furniture a few weeks ago and threw a party.The event halted construction in one of the townhouses to allow Interior Marketing Group, a luxury staging company, to furnish several floors and an outdoor space with cream-toned furniture and leather-and-steel coffee tables. The effect was eye-catching, if a bit jarring.About 100 brokers and prospective buyers donned hard hats and toured the styled construction site on Amity Street, said Jonathan Landau, chief executive of Fortis Property Group.Filling the unfinished space with furniture was a first for his firm, but a way to show potential buyers what the space could be. After all, he said, \u201cpeople didn\u2019t buy Teslas before the first ones were delivered.\u201d\u201cThese spaces are more unique,\u201d he added, noting that their size and layout are unusual for the market. Unlike two larger and wider, five-story townhouses in the development that have already sold, these are 65-feet deep, but only 16 feet wide \u2013 narrower than most townhouses in the area, which range from about 18- to 30-feet wide. Prices range from about $6 million to $7 million.To maximize the space, Mr. Landau said the six townhouses have ceilings up to 20 feet high and ample glass to fill their centers with light. A standard configuration includes 3,700 square feet with four bedrooms, four baths, two powder rooms and an elevator. Each house will also have basement access to parking and the option to use amenities at a neighboring condo building.\u201cThere were a bunch of wide eyes,\u201d said Paul Johansen, an associate broker with CORE, who is not involved in the project, but attended the party. He said this level of marketing might be typical in Manhattan, but not Brooklyn.At more than $1,600 a square foot, he said the townhouses are pricey for the neighborhood, where $1,200 to $1,500 a foot is more typical. He said the clients he brought to the party, a couple from Manhattan, weren\u2019t interested.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford Chief Outlines Investment Shift Away From Passenger Cars", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCar buyers want sport utility vehicles and trucks today. Automakers are feeling pressure to make the electric and self-driving vehicles that may define tomorrow.Ford Motor is betting billions of dollars that it can excel in meeting both of those demands, its new chief executive, Jim Hackett, said Tuesday. And in doing so, it will be moving away from the gasoline-powered passenger cars that have been its hallmark since the Model T.His blueprint for reinvigorating the automaker, whose stock price and profit growth have both been sluggish, also calls for shifting its geographic orientation. Ford now plans to invest more in regions that are growing and profitable, including China, and less on slower-growing regions such as Europe and India, Mr. Hackett said.He said Ford aims to take about $7 billion that was earmarked for developing new cars and put that money toward trucks and sport utility vehicles \u2014 big profit makers as gasoline prices remain low \u2014 as well as electric cars and autonomous vehicles.Putting more emphasis on introducing new trucks and S.U.V.s while also managing the transition to vehicles that lack an internal-combustion engine, or even a driver, will require a dual focus.Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com, said Ford might find the transition difficult. \u201cStraddling the now and the future will be tricky especially in terms of profitability,\u201d she said.At an appearance in New York that was also webcast, Mr. Hackett acknowledged that the company faced significant challenges. \u201cThe decision to change is not easy \u2014 culturally or operationally,\u201d he said, adding that the approaches that have brought success in the past \u201care really no guarantee of future success\u201d as the industry is reshaped.An immediate area of emphasis will be connected vehicles, which collect data about their operations and surroundings that can be used to improve safety and provide new digital services. \u201cOur vehicles will be smart and connected,\u201d Mr. Hackett said.By 2019, all new Ford models in the United States will be able to transmit data back to the company or its business partners, a step toward creating mobility services like ride-hailing and traffic avoidance. The company is planning a similar rollout in China. By 2020, 90 percent of all new models, regardless of market, will offer such connectivity.As part of that push, Ford is developing software that will enable vehicles to communicate with one another and with sensors along roadways and in traffic lights.In addition to revisiting its development priorities, Mr. Hackett vowed that Ford would become more efficient, cutting billions in material costs and engineering expenses over the next five years. Ford has average profit margins of about 6 percent in recent years, short of its goal of 8 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Mr. Hackett said.While Mr. Fields was a polished salesman and marketer, the company struggled to plot a course as the industry was reshaped by electric vehicles, autonomous technology and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.It was a reversal of fortune for Ford, which had been the only one of the three Detroit automakers to escape bankruptcy as the recession and financial crisis set in.When he arrived, Mr. Hackett promised to review all of Ford\u2019s businesses and operations, and prepare a plan within about 100 days for improving its \u201cfitness\u201d and strategic direction. Since then, he has said little in public.In the four and a half months since Mr. Hackett\u2019s ascent, Ford has elevated its share price by 14 percent, including 2 percent in Tuesday\u2019s trading session. But in the same period, G.M.\u2019s shares have risen 33 percent, and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s are up 71 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cost of Volkswagen Scandal Could Hurt Company\u2019s Electric Vehicle Push", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen has vowed to be the company that will make electric cars affordable for the masses.One way that Volkswagen was able to still report a profit in the quarter, though, was by cutting spending on research and development. That may not be a wise strategy during what Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, described in a statement Friday as a \u201cprofound structural transformation\u201d in the auto industry.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.The German company aims to deploy its enormous manufacturing network to churn out battery-powered cars faster, and in greater volume, than Tesla, which has had trouble meeting demand. But those plans may be difficult to reconcile with cuts in the research and development budget.The diesel scandal remains a dead weight on the company\u2019s finances and reputation. Volkswagen said Friday that legal settlements and other costs related to the emissions cheating have drained \u20ac14.5 billion this year from company coffers. That is money that Volkswagen would certainly prefer to spend developing new products.Volkswagen might be able to find savings in other areas, for example, by diverting money that could have been used to develop new diesel engines, said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the Fachhochschule der Wirtschaft, a technical university in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.Still, Mr. Bratzel said, \u201cit really hurts that this money is gone and is not available for the future.\u201dThe damage from the scandal, Volkswagen said in a statement, was \u201cnowhere near an end and would continue to necessitate great efforts throughout the entire group.\u201dAndreas Hoffbauer, a Volkswagen spokesman, said the company was responding to investors who have long complained that the research and development budget was spent inefficiently and was too large compared with rivals\u2019 budgets.The good news for the carmaker was that sales in the third quarter rose 6 percent, to \u20ac55 billion, thanks in part to a new SUV model introduced in the United States and economic recovery in Latin America.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.But there were also signs of trouble. In Germany, where Volkswagen has long dominated the market for affordable cars, sales fell 2 percent even as most competitors recorded sales gains. The company acknowledged that it has suffered from a buyer backlash against diesel, long one of its strongest selling points.In a reflection of growing anger in Germany toward Volkswagen, despite its position as a pillar of the economy, the number of lawsuits by aggrieved diesel owners has almost tripled to 4,600, the company said. Unlike the United States, Germany does not allow class-action suits by owners, who take a considerable financial risk by suing Volkswagen as individuals.The company acknowledged in the earnings report that one reason for the mediocre performance in Europe was \u201cthe fact that customer confidence has not yet been fully restored following the diesel issue and to customer uncertainty generated by the public discussion on driving bans for diesel vehicles.\u201dIn a positive development, Volkswagen made more money from its namesake brand than it did last year. Operating profit from cars with the VW logo doubled to \u20ac2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier.But the company remains dependent on its luxury brands Audi and Porsche, which generated more than twice as much profit, even though they sell fewer cars. Audi sales have slipped this year, also an ominous sign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Alternate Universe of Shopping, in Ohio", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 It was a scorching day outside, hot even for late summer in Ohio, and yet I was freezing. I had stepped inside the EB Ice Box, a meat-locker-like display at the Eddie Bauer store here that was cooled to 13 degrees Fahrenheit. The metal-sheathed room looked out onto the promenade of an upscale shopping mall, and featured a large block of ice for a bench. Even though I was wearing a down jacket (the room is meant to be a place where customers can test Eddie Bauer wear), the frigid air had gotten under my skin.The ice box was a gambit designed to attract the one thing so many stores like Eddie Bauer seem to be missing these days \u2014 customers.For shoppers, this city of 860,000 smack in the middle of a swing state, can feel like an alternate reality, a place where up is down and down is up. Frumpy department stores feature personal shopping services and boutique wellness amenities. Workaday grocery stores like Kroger offer exotic fruits and freshly baked artisan breads.Even the fast-food business is living in the future. McDonald\u2019s is offering table service from friendly waiters. Robots are taking orders at Wendy\u2019s. Chipotle started a chain that serves hamburgers.That kind of experimentation has long been a feature of the Columbus shopping scene, but these days it stems as much from desperation as from innovation. The physical retail market, crumbling in the face of competition from e-commerce sites, is in the midst of a transformation as fundamental as the one that shifted consumers to suburban shopping malls \u2014 and away from Main Street \u2014 half a century ago.Upstart brands powered by social media are stealing customers from established companies, and the carnage is widespread. More than a dozen major retailers, from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us to Payless ShoeSource, have sought bankruptcy protection this year. Thousands of stores have closed.Now, as brick-and-mortar retailers around the country stumble, the experimentation has taken on new urgency. Stores are trying out all manner of gimmickry \u2014 anything, really \u2014 to win back shoppers. And when brands want to try out new concepts, they often come to Columbus.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect melting pot for folks like us to test new concepts,\u201d said Roger Rawlins, chief executive of DSW, the shoe retailer, which is based in Columbus.Ohio State University\u2019s 65,000 students mean young shoppers are always on hand. Columbus is within a day\u2019s drive of nearly half of the United States population, making it a convenient hub for distribution. The city\u2019s relatively small size and contained media market make it affordable for companies to run advertising campaigns and measure their effectiveness. And its relatively low profile allows brands to try something and fail \u2014 without the scrutiny they would draw in New York or Los Angeles.Perhaps most important, a robust network of retailers and service providers \u2014 from big brands like Abercrombie & Fitch to small design firms that focus on store layouts \u2014 has taken root in Columbus. Today there are more fashion designers in Columbus than in any other American city besides New York and Los Angeles.But despite the central role that Columbus plays in the retail industry, there are no clear signs that all this experimentation will be able to save the hometown brands. Half a dozen major retailers \u2014 from Abercrombie & Fitch to the parent company of Victoria\u2019s Secret \u2014 have their headquarters in Columbus. Just about all of them have suffered significant declines in their market value over the past year. Retail employment is falling.Local boosters put an optimistic Midwestern spin on the situation. \u201cA lot of the challenges that retailers are grappling with, there\u2019s a whole ecosystem of companies here who are working on fixing that,\u201d Ms. Alvarez said. And in Columbus and beyond, there is much about the retail business that needs fixing.Shoppers in Columbus once flocked to two malls, Eastland and Westland. Two decades ago, both were thriving retail temples, anchored by department stores, stuffed with windowless shops and served by mediocre food courts.On the other side of town, Eastland is not faring much better. Most of the big brands have moved out, leaving just a collection of eyebrow salons, discount retailers and off-brand fast-food providers.\u201cThere are a lot of zombie malls out there,\u201d said Steve Morris, a co-founder of the Asset Strategies Group, a Columbus firms that helps companies manage their real estate holdings. \u201cWe\u2019re just over-retailed in the U.S.\u201dYaromir Steiner, a real estate developer, concurred \u201cWe\u2019ve been building malls like there\u2019s no tomorrow,\u201d said Mr. Steiner, chief executive of Steiner & Associates. \u201cAmerica overbuilt.\"Yet Mr. Steiner, it could be argued, is partly responsible for the slow demise of centers like Eastland and Westland. He is a disrupter in the mall industry, and his most successful development, Easton Town Center, on the northeast edge of the city, serves a vital role in the test market ecosystem.In the early 1990s, Mr. Steiner, a Turkish immigrant, was an aspiring developer in Miami. Asked to help develop a shopping center in the upscale Coconut Grove neighborhood, he took a cue from the bustling open-air commercial districts of Istanbul. Instead of building a big box and stuffing stores inside, he proposed turning the mall inside out, placing shops along tree-lined pathways and bringing in upscale restaurants with outdoor seating.Working with some of the most influential retail forces in Columbus, Mr. Steiner designed and now manages Easton Town Center, a development that is less a mall than a small city. In addition to hundreds of stores, there are millions of square feet of office space, restaurants, apartments and hotel rooms.It was hardly a guaranteed success. \u201cA guy with an accent comes from Miami and says we\u2019ll do an open-air project in a place that gets 40 inches of snow?\u201d Mr. Steiner said. \u201cI didn\u2019t stand the chance of a snowball in hell.\u201dEaston Town Center is also where many retailers do their experimenting. The Eddie Bauer store is there. Nearby, an explosion of neon lighting and skimpy lingerie signals the presence of a La Senza store, a Canadian brand that is just being introduced to the United States. And around the corner, Lane Bryant, the plus-size women\u2019s clothing company, has introduced LaneStyle Studio, a personal shopping program that offers customers one-on-one appointments.Also at Polaris, Mr. Rawlins, the chief executive of DSW, is tinkering with his own business model. At a location he calls \u201cthe lab store,\u201d Mr. Rawlins is testing new offerings including shoe rental, shoe storage and cobbler services, even a nail salon.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for other ways to retain our customers,\u201d he said.Les Wexner, a Columbus native, remembers that when he attended Ohio State University in the late 1950s, his professors told him an unusual fact: Columbus was a major test market for consumer goods companies. When corporations wanted to see if a new soap or detergent would have broad appeal, they came to Columbus.A few years later, Mr. Wexner opened his first women\u2019s clothing store in town, calling it The Limited. As the company expanded, he took his education to heart, trying out new styles and store designs in his hometown before rolling them out to new markets.\u201cBefore I even started the business, Columbus was a great test market,\u201d Mr. Wexner said in an interview. \u201cThe customers here were average, and the thinking was that things they liked or rejected would be predictive for the rest of the country.\u201dThe strategy worked. The Limited grew into a retail behemoth. Over the years, Mr. Wexner acquired some brands and introduced others, and at one time or another owned Lane Bryant, Abercrombie & Fitch and Express under the umbrella of his company, L Brands. All along the way, he tested new ideas.\u201cLes was never satisfied,\u201d said Denny Gerdeman, who once designed stores for Mr. Wexner and is now a co-founder of the Columbus design firm Chute Gerdeman. \u201cEvery six months we had to redesign the stores.\u201dMr. Wexner, the longest-serving chief executive of a major American company and a billionaire many times over, is not particularly modest about his accomplishments.\u201cWalt Disney invented characters, and I invent businesses,\u201d Mr. Wexner said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly inventing, reinventing and spinning off businesses.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Wexner made his fortune with a preternatural ability to see retail\u2019s future. He anticipated the rise of casual attire, spotted underappreciated brands and knew when to sell them off before they lost their luster.Mr. Wexner\u2019s penchant for experimentation extended beyond his stores, too. It was he, along with a developer called the Georgetown Company, who called up Mr. Steiner in Miami and helped develop Easton Town Center.Over the years, Mr. Wexner spun off most of the brands he had acquired, seeding Columbus with a new crop of independent companies that in turn tossed off their own spinoffs and imitators. And over the years, an industry emerged. In same way that Hewlett-Packard gave birth to Silicon Valley\u2019s technology sector, Mr. Wexner\u2019s relentless deal making has spawned a network of companies that now shapes people\u2019s tastes from coast to coast.Today the L Brands headquarters share a campus with Express, which is now a public company of its own. The Abercrombie & Fitch headquarters are a short drive away.\u201cIt all stems from Les Wexner,\u201d said Steve Zawada, chief operating officer at Eloquii, a plus-size women\u2019s clothing company based in Columbus.But with few exceptions, the industry that Columbus helped create is now under threat. After years of job gains, retail employment in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, has decreased over the last year, according to the Columbus Chamber of Commerce. Today, retailers employ some 68,000 people, down from more than 93,000 in 2001.Shares of Express are down about 45 percent this year. Ascena, the Columbus company that now owns Lane Bryant, has seen its stock plummet by 69 percent over the same time. And Abercrombie & Fitch and DSW have also fallen over the last full year.Even Mr. Wexner\u2019s company, after decades of success, appears to be in decline. Shares of L Brands, which today includes Victoria\u2019s Secret, Bath & Body Works, Henri Bendel and La Senza, have fallen by 42 percent over the past year. Sales at Victoria\u2019s Secret were down 12 percent from last year through September, as women buy their lingerie elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m perfectly willing to accept that women may never wear bras,\u201d Mr. Wexner said, tossing aside the notion that his products might one day be obsolete. \u201cBut probably women will still wear bras. The categories we are in we think have futures.\u201dOlder brands can only hope for such happy problems, and instead are left trying to innovate their way back to relevance.Smaller details are being tinkered with, too. The trays have higher edges to reduce spills. Fries are served in cups instead of sleeves. Through a partnership with the digital music service Pandora, Wendy\u2019s curates the restaurant\u2019s playlist based on what people in a five-mile radius are listening to. There is even counter seating that looks into the Wendy\u2019s kitchen, where line cooks are preparing salads made to order \u2014 a first for the chain.\u201cCustomers have a certain idea about what they think fast-food restaurants are,\u201d said Abigail Pringle, chief development officer at Wendy\u2019s, which is based in the Columbus region. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to shake that up.\u201dThen there is the EB Ice Box. Colin Berg, Eddie Bauer\u2019s brand historian, said the idea was actually an old one. In the 1950s, Eddie Bauer himself would instruct employees to spend time in cold storage lockers and make sure the company\u2019s parkas kept them warm.But the company may have to do more than install a nifty in-store display to ensure a successful future. Mr. Berg said \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d suggested that the EB Ice Box had been a hit with customers, who enjoy popping in for a blast of arctic air. Yet on a series of recent afternoons, the EB Ice Box, along with the Eddie Bauer store itself, was mostly empty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Electric Car Owners, \u2018Range Anxiety\u2019 Gives Way to \u2018Charging Time Trauma\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAn oft-cited reason people don\u2019t buy electric cars is \u201crange anxiety\u201d \u2014 if batteries struggle to take you as far as gas and charging stations are limited in number, the thinking goes, who would want one?But there is another obstacle: charging time trauma. Compared with a five-minute pit stop at your local gas station, charging an electric vehicle is a glacially slow experience. Modern electric cars still often need an entire night to recharge at home, and even at a commercial fast charging station, a fill-up can take an hour or more.\u201cDriving long distances and stopping for one to two hours is not something I would want to do,\u201d said Mark McNabb, the chief executive of Electrify America, a Volkswagen subsidiary that is installing charging stations across the United States as part of the German automaker\u2019s settlement for cheating on diesel emissions tests.The good news? Charging times will eventually shrink to little more than 10 minutes. The bad news: That won\u2019t be for several years.Still, there is help is on the way. Manufacturers are installing more charging points across the country, and technological improvements are already allowing for charging times to improve.Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet \u2014 the kind used by some large appliances \u2014 and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary \u201csupercharger\u201d for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.Several companies are making big bets on the technology.Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with \u201cthousands\u201d in place by 2020.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for similar solutions across the globe,\u201d said Mike Tinskey, Ford\u2019s global director of electrification and infrastructure.There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today\u2019s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won\u2019t get too hot.Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.Under the state\u2019s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state\u2019s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.\u201cWe hope we\u2019ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,\u201d said Caroline Choi, the utility\u2019s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.So customers will have to stick to charging an electric vehicle whenever it\u2019s not being used, much as they already do with smartphones and tablets.According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it\u2019s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.\u201cElectric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,\u201d said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint. They are like a horse that eats whenever you\u2019re not riding it: \u201cyou refuel them when you\u2019re doing something else.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of vehicle charging done at home. According to ChargePoint, it is 80 percent, not 90 percent. The article also misstated in one instance the company run by Pasquale Romano. As noted elsewhere in the article, he is the chief executive of ChargePoint, not of Electrify America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kimbal Musk Wants to Feed America, Silicon Valley-Style", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEMPHIS \u2014 It\u2019s easy to understand why some people in this town of soul music and dry-rub ribs don\u2019t know what to make of the tall tech billionaire in a big white cowboy hat who has been opening restaurants and buying up hundreds of acres of land that used to grow cotton.Kimbal Musk, 45, got rich working in tech alongside his older brother, Elon. Now he wants to do for food what his brother has done for electric cars and space travel.\u201cThe Americana here gives me goose bumps,\u201d Mr. Musk, who grew up in South Africa, said during a visit to Memphis last spring. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Graceland twice. The community has been so welcoming, it\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201dMr. Musk is promoting a philosophy he calls \u201creal food,\u201d which nourishes the body, the farmer and the planet. It doesn\u2019t sound much different than what writers like Michael Pollan and everyone who has ever helped start a farmers\u2019 market or community garden have preached for years.But Mr. Musk has big ideas about what the Silicon Valley crowd likes to call the food space, which is as exciting to him as the internet was in 1995. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this kind of innovation around food,\u201d he said.In short, he wants to create a network of business, educational and agricultural ventures big enough to swing the nation\u2019s food system back to one based on healthy, local food grown on chemical-free farms.\u201cFood is this beautiful gift we give each other three times a day,\u201d he\u2019ll often tell a crowd, \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t design a worse food system than what we have.\u201dBut many people who have long labored on the front lines of the battle are still not quite sure what to make of him.For all his business and tech acumen, Mr. Musk can sometimes seem tone-deaf. At a conference on food waste in New York last month, he declared from the stage that \u201cfood is one of the final frontiers that technology hasn\u2019t tackled yet. If we do it well, it will mean good food for all.\u201dAlmost unwittingly, Mr. Musk has become a symbol of a growing divide between those raised on the modern American food movement \u2014 which gained traction in the 1970s and drove a revival in cooking, local products and food justice \u2014 and a new generation excited about cellular proteins, Soylent and app-based delivery services that are driven more by innovation than by pleasure.Gregarious, open and confident, Mr. Musk is a lot of fun to hang around with, a playful counterpart to his quirky, brilliant brother, with whom he remains very close.He wears a cowboy hat because he tried one at a store in Austin, Tex., a few years ago and decided it looked good on him. Never mind that people make fun of it behind his back. Criticism, whether focused on his looks or his philosophy, doesn\u2019t seem to bother him.\u201cMy way of working is very practical,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many wonderful solutions to real food, but I focus on what we can scale. The Slow Food guys were right, but what they didn\u2019t know was how to scale. If you can\u2019t scale, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cI noticed that when I cooked, my dad especially would make us all sit down and eat together,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved it.\u201dSoon after, he and Jen Lewin, his first wife, left for Colorado, where he met Mr. Matheson and opened The Kitchen in 2004. With its deep farm-to-table ethos and casually elegant style, the restaurant was an immediate hit.Both projects were running just fine without him, so Mr. Musk became chief executive of another tech company. Then, on a 2010 trip with his family in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he was sliding down a snowy hill on an inner tube when it flipped. He broke his neck and was temporarily paralyzed.During the two months he had to lie flat on his back, it became clear that he wanted to devote himself to food. He and his wife divorced; he quit the tech company and dedicated himself to changing the way Americans eat.Mr. Musk became interested in school gardens. He remains friendly with his ex-wife (the couple have two boys, and he has a daughter with another woman), and Ms. Lewin designed modular curved plastic planters that could be arranged in any schoolyard. Paired with instructions on how they can be used to teach subjects like science, the first gardens were installed in Denver schools in 2011.All the food is cooked from scratch. Menus feature wild salmon, burgers of local pasture-raised beef and big Greek salads with vegetables from nearby farms. Entree prices average $14, and the restaurants are designed so customers sit down together to eat and get their meals almost as soon as they order.The first opened six years ago next to The Kitchen in Boulder. In September, another opened in a huge urban renewal project in Memphis called Crosstown Concourse, an abandoned Sears distribution center that has been turned into apartments and shops, with a school, a health clinic and an arts center. The partners plan to add 50 more Next Door restaurants by the end of 2020.He is also testing the Kitchenette, a little takeout spot in Shelby Farms that sells locally grown, well-prepared meals for about $5 \u2014 his answer to a fast-food restaurant.He is not a fan of traditional school garden programs. \u201cThey don\u2019t scale at all,\u201d he said.There are other ways to ruffle the feathers of Alice Waters, the Bay Area chef who helped pioneer the American slow-food movement and the concept of the edible schoolyard, but criticizing her approach to local food and school gardens is near the top of the list.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear another word about scaling,\u201d Ms. Waters said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s very earnest about what he\u2019s doing, but he doesn\u2019t know enough about farming and about the soil. He wants to do the right thing, but he just hasn\u2019t done his homework. Not everything has to be scalable.\u201dMr. Musk says he is \u201cabsolutely in conflict\u201d with Ms. Waters. \u201cI love her, but I don\u2019t agree with her views.\u201d\u201cSomebody like Kimbal Musk could be an important bridge to bring some of these ideas together,\u201d Dr. Broad said.Maybe, Mr. Musk says. He is as much a believer in the power of technology as anyone in Silicon Valley. But he is a cook at heart.\u201cOptimizing for efficiency over everything else sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever eaten in Palo Alto?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.M. and Ford Lay Out Plans to Expand Electric Models", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 China has said it will eventually ban gasoline-powered cars. California may be moving in the same direction. That pressure has set off a scramble by the world\u2019s car companies to embrace electric vehicles.On Monday, General Motors, America\u2019s largest automaker, staked its claim to leadership. Outlining a fundamental shift in its vision of the industry, it announced plans for 20 new all-electric models by 2023, including two within the next 18 months.\u201cGeneral Motors believes in an all-electric future,\u201d said Mark L. Reuss, G.M.\u2019s global product chief. \u201cAlthough that future won\u2019t happen overnight, G.M. is committed to driving increased usage and acceptance of electric vehicles.\u201dIn the first eight months of 2017, even with federal tax incentives, Americans purchased only about 60,000 battery-powered electric vehicles, and about the same number of plug-in hybrid models, according to Hybridcars.com. That amounts to 1 percent of the market.More than consumer demand, however, it is regulatory pressure that is revving up the electric push, with officials in China, Europe and the United States ratcheting up emissions standards and setting or discussing deadlines that could eliminate gasoline-powered cars within a generation.The announcements by G.M. and Ford follow pledges by the German automakers Volkswagen and Daimler to build hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles in the coming years, and the decision by Volvo, the Chinese-owned Swedish luxury brand, to convert its entire lineup to either electric cars or hybrid vehicles that are powered by both batteries and gas.The accelerated pace of development also reflects the symbiotic relationship between battery-powered cars and another technological frontier; auto companies are tying their electric-car plans to lofty goals of building fleets of autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.The automakers believe they can solve the problem of achieving \u2014 as G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, has begun stressing \u2014 a world with \u201czero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion.\u201dIt is a stunning statement from a company that, together with Ford, sells more large pickup trucks and full-size sport utility vehicles than the rest of the global industry combined \u2014 and from an industry that grudgingly got into building electric vehicles in the face of stricter fuel emissions standards.On Monday, Mr. Reuss framed the company\u2019s strategy as a natural outgrowth of what it had learned from its existing entry in the all-electric arena, the Chevrolet Bolt, even though it has achieved only negligible sales so far.\u201cThere is a transition going on,\u201d said Mr. Reuss, adding that G.M. has no timetable to eliminate gasoline engines from its vehicles. He said that by the 2023 target date for the new electric models, G.M. will still be building cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles with internal combustion engines.\u201cThey wisely gave no time frame because, frankly, no one knows how the future will evolve,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the research firm Autotrader.Ford already fields several slow-selling hybrid, battery-powered and plug-in models, and has said it also plans to add hybrid versions of its big sports-utility vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, as it expands its electric offerings.The company has formed a group it calls Team Edison to focus on pure battery-electric cars, said Sherif Marakby, Ford\u2019s vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification.By 2020, Ford plans to produce an electric car that can go 300 miles before needing to recharge, Mr. Marakby said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big change,\u201d he said, compared with the early electric models that could go fewer than 100 miles, a limitation that made them impractical for many consumers.However the tastes and demand for electric vehicles evolve domestically, China may have the biggest influence in shaping the marketplace. Sales of electric vehicles, or E.V.s, are already in the hundreds of thousands there and could exceed 400,000 by 2019, representing two-fifths of the world market, according to LMC Automotive, a global consulting company.\u201cChina is a huge part of the story in E.V.s, and it is a big factor in the decision making of the automakers,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner who tracks auto-industry technology. \u201cChina\u2019s move toward higher emissions standards and the E.V. mandates gives the big global automakers certainty that they are going to have a significant market for these cars and they can know these investments will be worth it.\u201dThe chief auto-emissions regulator in California \u2014 whose agency largely sets the standards to which automakers design their American fleets \u2014 said last week that Gov. Jerry Brown was asking why his state shouldn\u2019t follow suit.Investors reacted positively to G.M.\u2019s announcement, with its shares tacking on more than 4 percent in Monday\u2019s trading. And Mr. Reuss said G.M. did not expect to be hurt financially by a shift toward electric models, which at least for now can cost more to produce than comparably sized gasoline-powered vehicles.\u201cThe future will be profitable,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption referred incorrectly to when Mary Barra, the chief executive of G.M., was discussing features of the Chevrolet Bolt. It was January 2016, not January 2017.Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Warren, Mich., and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}

That would be a mistake.Further, experts warn that the hype around automated cars is belied by the struggles these machines have in the rain, or when tree branches hang too low, or on bridges or on roads with faded lane markings.Lawmakers have to do better than that if they care about what the public is saying. A bill passed by the House last month would let manufacturers sell up to 25,000 automated cars a year without meeting all federal safety standards, and up to 100,000 cars after three years. The companies would not even have to establish that their cars are as safe as conventional vehicles before the number of exemptions increased.A bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee is a bit better. It would require a safety evaluation before raising the cap on exemptions. It would also limit the total number to 80,000.A larger problem with both bills is that they would do nothing to increase the size of the budget or staff of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is responsible for overseeing the industry and will have to write new rules for self-driving cars.Today, the agency is woefully unprepared to regulate self-driving cars, particularly at the scale proponents hope to see down the line. More electrical engineers, programmers and cybersecurity specialists who can evaluate such cars have to be hired.Among other challenges, the agency has to come up with standards for what happens when a highly automated car has to hand control back to a human driver. The results could be devastating if drivers are distracted because they place too much trust in their cars.There\u2019s no doubt that a driverless future would profoundly change society, even in ways we\u2019re not even considering yet. People might stop buying cars because services like Uber, once its cars are automated, would be cheaper to use. That could cause mass unemployment for taxi drivers and greatly reduce car sales, potentially hurting the economy. It would also make parking garages and parking spaces superfluous, freeing up valuable real estate.More people might decide to live, say, 100 miles from their workplaces because algorithms would make traffic flow more smoothly and allow people to nap, work or watch Netflix while commuting.Cities could be forced to put up barriers separating cars from pedestrians, who might feel emboldened to walk into traffic believing that cars would automatically stop for them.Automakers, lawmakers and regulators need to do more to perfect this technology, and reassure the public. There is a lot riding on that work.Advertisement"}

In the evacuation zones, rows of destroyed houses made it feel like a country at war, emptied of its civilian population.Small fires seemed to pop up everywhere. As I raced down narrow country roads to meet deadlines, I caught glimpses of smoldering embers on tree stumps a few feet away. I felt vulnerable while driving through tunnels of vegetation \u2014 it would be easy to be surrounded by fire and trapped.Everything smelled of smoke: my clothes, my car, my bag, my fingers.I feel enormously grateful to the dozens of people who took the time to articulate their grieving, some while standing in the rubble of their homes.

{"Headline": "What Virtual Reality Can Teach a Driverless Car", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the computers that operate driverless cars digest the rules of the road, some engineers think it might be nice if they can learn from mistakes made in virtual reality rather than on real streets.Companies like Toyota, Uber and Waymo have discussed at length how they are testing autonomous vehicles on the streets of Mountain View, Calif., Phoenix and other cities. What is not as well known is that they are also testing vehicles inside computer simulations of these same cities. Virtual cars, equipped with the same software as the real thing, spend thousands of hours driving their digital worlds.Think of it as a way of identifying flaws in the way the cars operate without endangering real people. If a car makes a mistake on a simulated drive, engineers can tweak its software accordingly, laying down new rules of behavior. On Monday, Waymo, the autonomous car company that spun out of Google, is expected to show off its simulator tests when it takes a group of reporters to its secretive testing center in California\u2019s Central Valley.Researchers are also developing methods that would allow cars to actually learn new behavior from these simulations, gathering skills more quickly than human engineers could ever lay them down with explicit software code. \u201cSimulation is a tremendous thing,\u201d said Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, one of the artificial intelligence labs exploring this kind of virtual training for autonomous vehicles and other robotics.\u201cThis is why we think we can move fast,\u201d said Luc Vincent, who recently started an autonomous vehicle project at Lyft, Uber\u2019s main rival. \u201cThis stuff didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago when Google started.\u201dFor now, if it doesn\u2019t carry a backup driver, any autonomous vehicle will probably be limited to a small area with large streets, little precipitation, and relatively few pedestrians. And it will drive at low speeds, often waiting for extended periods before making a left-hand turn or merging into traffic without the help of a stoplight or street sign \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t avoid these situations altogether.The trouble is that this requires enormous amounts of data collected by cameras, radar and other sensors that document real-world objects and situations. And humans must label this data, identifying pedestrians, street signs and the like. Gathering and labeling data describing every conceivable situation is an impossibility. Data on accidents, for instance, is hard to come by. This is where simulations can help.Mr. Pratt said Toyota is already using images of simulated roadways to train neural networks, and this approach has yielded promising results. In other words, the simulations are similar enough to the physical world to reliably train the systems that operate the cars.Part of the advantage with a simulator is that researchers have complete control over it. They need not spend time and money labeling images \u2014 and potentially making mistakes with these labels. \u201cYou have ground truth,\u201d Mr. Pratt explained. \u201cYou know where every car is. You know where every pedestrian is. You know where every bicycler is. You know the weather.\u201dDeepMind used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game Go better than any human. In essence, the machine played thousands upon thousands of Go games against itself, carefully recording which moves proved successful and which didn\u2019t. And now, DeepMind and other leading labs are using similar techniques in building machines that can play complex video games like StarCraft.That may seem frivolous. But if machines can navigate these virtual worlds, they can make their way through the physical world.Bridging the gap between the virtual and the physical is no easy task, Mr. Pratt said. And companies must also ensure that algorithms don\u2019t learn unexpected or harmful behavior while learning on their own. That is a big worry among artificial intelligence researchers.For this and other reasons, companies like Toyota and Waymo are not building these cars solely around machine learning. They also hand-coded software in more traditional ways in an effort to guarantee certain behavior. Waymo cars don\u2019t learn to stop at stop lights, for example. There is a hard and fast rule that they stop.But the industry is headed toward more machine learning, not less. It provides a better way to train the car to do tasks like identifying lane makers, said Waymo\u2019s vice president of engineering Dmitri Dolgov. But it becomes even more important, he explained, when a car needs a much deeper understanding of the world around it. \u201cRobotics and machine learning go hand in hand,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars Could Come to Manhattan", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPity the poor taxi drivers. First came Uber, now comes no one.Manhattan may become the first self-driving car testing grounds in New York State, according to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who announced on Tuesday that General Motors, via its start-up subsidiary Cruise Automation, has applied to test the nascent technology in early 2018 in the borough.G.M. has already begun mapping a test site in Manhattan, according to the governor\u2019s office. It will submit its full application to the Department of Motor Vehicles, which will then issue any permits. The testing itself will be supervised by the State Police.Nonetheless, the announcement was greeted with skepticism from various corners, including officials in the de Blasio administration, who raised concerns about the program.\u201cThe city wasn\u2019t give much notice of this idea and we certainly weren\u2019t consulted,\u201d said Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe have very real safety concerns. We are obviously looking forward to some detail on this idea before any cars hit the streets.\u201dThe governor\u2019s office disputed the account; Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, said talks with city began on the subject in August. \u201cThis hyperventilating is more than a little silly.\u201dThe driverless trials will include two passengers: an engineer sitting behind the wheel to monitor and evaluate performance, and a second person in the passenger seat, according to the governor\u2019s announcement. Such tests were recently made legal with legislation passed as part of New York\u2019s 2018 budget.\u201cAutonomous vehicles have the potential to save time and save lives,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cThe spirit of innovation is what defines New York, and we are positioned on the forefront of this emerging industry.\u201dDriverless cars have zipped around New York a handful of times before, but mainly as stunts, carrying politicians, like Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was driven by nobody several times in June.It is also unclear if the demand for self-driving cars exists; several studies indicate that for the most part, consumers do not yet seem to want them.\u201cNew York City is one of the most densely populated places in the world and provides new opportunities to expose our software to unusual situations,\u201d according to a statement from Cruise\u2019s chief executive officer, Kyle Vogt. \u201cWhich means we can improve our software at a much faster rate.\u201dFailing to embrace the emerging automation could leave the state behind, according to a recent study conducted by the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy organization. But there are risks, according the report\u2019s findings.The technology, if not implemented well, the study cautions, has the potential to be yet another disrupter \u2014 much like Uber, the ride-hailing app that has sent the taxi industry spiraling and ratcheted up congestion in many places.\u201cAll these drivers, they live here, too,\u201d said Omar Faruq, 41, a yellow cab and Uber driver, as he waited for a fare on West 40th Street on Tuesday. \u201cTo have self-driving cars, to have them in the street, what are all these people going to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe companies, they\u2019re making the money.

{"Headline": "Driverless Cars Made Me Nervous. Then I Tried One.", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn my fourth day in a semi-driverless car, I finally felt comfortable enough to let it stop itself. Before then, I\u2019d allowed the car \u2014 a Volvo S90 sedan \u2014 to steer around gentle turns, with my hands still on the wheel, and to adjust speed in traffic. By Day 4, I was ready to make a leap into the future.With the car traveling 40 miles an hour on a busy road in the Washington suburbs, I pushed a button to activate the driverless mode and moved my foot away from the brake and accelerator. The car kept its speed. Soon, a traffic light in the distance turned red, and the cars in front of me slowed. For a split second, I prepared to slam on the brake.There was no need. The cameras and computers in the Volvo recognized that other cars were slowing and smoothly began applying the brake. My car came to a stop behind the Ford ahead of me. I began laughing, even though no one else was in the car, as my anxiety turned to relief.When a friend saw me in the Volvo last week and I explained that I was test-driving it for work, she asked which roads I\u2019d be using \u2014 so she could avoid them. Another friend asked if driverless cars could be hacked. Colleagues said they feared semiautonomous cars lulling people into ignoring the road.Driverless cars tap deep into the human psyche. We want to be in control, or at least to give control to trained professionals, like doctors. We don\u2019t want computers to be in charge.They rationalized their own imperfections, while obsessing over the computer\u2019s shortcomings. It didn\u2019t matter that the human beings made more mistakes \u2014 a lot more \u2014 than the computer.The death count from cars exceeds that from guns. So if you are outraged by guns and want things to change, you should feel the same about car crashes.The technology for semi-driverless cars still isn\u2019t good enough or cheap enough. The $50,000 Volvo I was driving \u2014 like a Tesla I\u2019ve tried \u2014 got confused by unpainted lane lines, for instance, and I had to take over. But the technology is improving rapidly. Within a few years, many cars will have sophisticated crash-avoidance systems.I expect that we will agonize about using them, out of both legitimate caution and irrational fear. Any driverless crashes will be sensationalized, as has already happened, while we ignore tens of thousands of deaths from human crashes. But I still expect that driving will be revolutionized sooner than many people now understand.That\u2019s where driving is headed. The shift will be gradual, not sudden, as Google\u2019s chief economist, Hal Varian, told me. Cars will handle many tasks, while a human driver will have override power. The combination won\u2019t be perfect, but it can be much better than the status quo.My own experience also leads me to think that attitudes may change quickly. One of the more powerful forces in human psychology is known as the familiarity principle. After people have experience with something, they usually feel more positively about it.I began my short time with the Volvo too nervous to use some features. By the end, I was confident that the car made me safer. Now that I\u2019m back to driving a nearly decade-old Toyota, I miss the things that initially made me anxious.Advertisement"}
