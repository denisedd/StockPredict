{"Headline": "Wandering Madrid, With No Itinerary Necessary", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal ShoppingMADRID \u2014 Living in Madrid for the last 15 years, I\u2019ve witnessed a transformation in the city\u2019s shopping experience so astonishingly favorable that it defies warnings about the dire straits of retail. While it certainly didn\u2019t feel like good news at the time, the financial crisis of 2009 to 2013 spawned a change in Spanish consumption from bigger and blander global brands to better, bespoke and distinctly local design. In a country where exceptional items that are both beautiful and functional are still produced, it\u2019s wonderful to feel that spark of creativity and quality on the city sidewalks.For years on the western side of the Paseo de la Castellana, the city\u2019s main north-south axis, there were just a few trendy shopping streets like Almirante or Blanca de Navarra that featured clusters of smaller brands and chic one-off shops. Now those little centers of style have spread out to create some of the city\u2019s coolest neighborhoods \u2014 Salesas, Chueca and Malasa\u00f1a \u2014 which provide a wonderful day of wandering and shopping without following any set itinerary.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Political Unrest Threatens Spain\u2019s Return to Economic Vigor", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Those inclined to the view that no price can be placed on freedom have presumably missed the action in the Spanish bond market.As a result, Spain now finds itself having to pay slightly higher premiums to persuade investors to buy its debt. That is likely to translate into higher borrowing costs for Spanish banks, and less credit for Spanish businesses and households, depriving the economy of fuel.Increased borrowing costs were showing no signs of spilling into Italy, Portugal or other regional economies on Friday. The euro \u2014 seemingly never far from danger \u2014 was, at least for the time being, spared fresh crisis.But banks based in Catalonia, which suffered plunges in their share prices following the independence referendum, have been exploring plans to shift their headquarters to other parts of Spain. The possibility that Catalonia might declare independence has left those banks vulnerable to being severed from Spain and \u2014 by extension \u2014 the European Union and the bloc of nations that uses the euro currency.Such isolation would put at risk the banks\u2019 ability to transact with clients across the Continent and to tap the largess of European institutions should another crisis emerge.On Thursday, the board of one bank, Banco Sabadell, approved the transfer of the lender\u2019s headquarters to Alicante, a city on the Mediterranean, 330 miles south of Barcelona, and a place in no danger of ceasing to be part of Spain. By the end of the day, Sabadell\u2019s stock had surged more than 6 percent.On Friday, the Spanish government decreed a legal change giving firms the right to move their headquarters without having to win the approval of shareholders. Soon, CaixaBank convened its board, agreeing on Friday evening to move from Barcelona to Valencia \u2014 another city solidly within Spain.In other industries, like textiles, telecommunications and energy, companies have in recent days made similar moves. All were seemingly intent on foreclosing the possibility of landing in a state of crippling purgatory if Catalonia became independent.\u201cWe have just gotten through a major crisis,\u201d said Carlos Buesa, founder and chief executive of Oryzon Genomics, a Spanish biopharmaceutical firm. \u201cWhat is happening now gives me a sense of sadness and incredulity. If this political conflict over the Catalan identity continues, the Catalan economy will be impoverished.\u201dInvestment has been returning to Spain, financing its fast-growing auto industry and a resumption of construction. The unemployment rate has dropped from a terrifying peak of 26 percent to a still-alarming 17 percent. But political turmoil, legal ambiguity and confusion over the basic geography of Spain could prompt a reversal.\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Angel Talavera, a senior eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London and a native of Spain. \u201cAs long as this situation is so confusing and no one really knows what\u2019s going to happen, money is going to start leaving Spain. Money moves fast.\u201dOn Friday, Madrid was paying 1.7 percent on its 10-year bonds. That was a modest number, far from a sign of the world on fire. Yet it was twice as high as a year earlier. The gap between what investors were demanding for taking on Spanish debt and that for taking on German debt \u2014 the least risky asset in Europe \u2014 has widened slightly in recent weeks.The increase to borrowing costs was fueled by a gnawing question: If Catalonia were to depart Spain, what happens to Spain\u2019s debt obligations?\u201cIn the sovereign bond market, the only guarantee is that someone should trust the state that issued the debt,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cSay Spain breaks up. Who is responsible for this debt? Are they going to split it between Catalonia and the rest of Spain?\u201dRoughly a fifth of Spain\u2019s total economic output comes from Catalonia. Whatever territories were to emerge from a divorce, they would be smaller and presumably less creditworthy than the government standing behind Spanish bonds now.The operative assumption in the marketplace is that Catalan independence will not happen. But markets trade in probabilities. The odds for independence have improved in recent days. Investors are demanding compensation for the elevated risks of holding Spanish debt.The unease appeared to be amplified by a case of chronic uncertainty fatigue plaguing Europe, especially as Britain pursues its exit from the European Union. Brexit, as that is known, has unleashed a bewildering array of unknowns on the European marketplace, and especially for global banks.In Spain, unpredictable forces were washing over the economy. The Catalan referendum was held on Sunday. As markets opened on Monday, investors punished banking stocks.\u201cInvestors saw the ears of the wolf,\u201d said Miguel Otero Iglesias, a senior analyst at Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid. \u201cIf people are willing to put children in front of riot police, they might as well be claiming independence. That\u2019s when rational business calculation starts to flounder.\u201dBy the end of trading on Wednesday, Banco Sabadell\u2019s shares were down by nearly 10 percent while CaixaBank had suffered an 8 percent plunge.Among the most heavily regulated products on the planet are pharmaceuticals. On Tuesday, Oryzon Genomics announced that it was moving to Madrid from Barcelona.\u201cWe are at risk of being caught in a situation of legal limbo following a possible unilateral declaration of independence,\u201d said Mr. Buesa, the company\u2019s chief executive. Oryzon\u2019s share price soon surged by nearly 13 percent.The rest of Catalonia and Spain do not appear likely to find such a quick fix.\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty right now,\u201d said Mr. Borri, the finance professor. \u201cMarkets are worried.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Push Into a Resurging Market: House Flipping", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersBut that real estate strategy \u2014 in which a home is bought, renovated and resold quickly \u2014 requires fast access to money, and developers are willing to pay higher interest rates for it. The loans are backed by the property and are short, typically running for a year or less. And the funds that finance them offer reliable returns of about 8 percent, for those who can meet minimum investments, generally $100,000.But the loans \u2014 sometimes referred to as fix-and-flip or hard-money loans \u2014 come with risks, including developers unable to pay them back and a drop in real estate prices that could make properties hard to sell or even rent.Chris Gutek, a former equity analyst at Morgan Stanley who has been an independent investor in Grand Rapids, Mich., for the last decade, said he lost money on loan funds in 2008 but remained bullish on the sector.\u201cI was getting nice 12 to 13 percent interest for a few years, but I had one very bad experience in 2008,\u201d Mr. Gutek said. \u201cI lost a bunch of money. It was not good underwriting.\u201dFunds set up these days by lenders like Genesis Capital in Los Angeles and Anchor Loans in Calabasas, Calif., say they are more transparent and conservative in their underwriting. Mr. Gutek has put about 20 percent of his liquid assets in a fund managed by Broadmark Capital, an investment bank in Seattle that has $350 million in 200 short-term loans.\u201cSince 2009, the fund hasn\u2019t been tested, and I\u2019m very, very aware of that,\u201d Mr. Gutek said. \u201cThere is some risk that real estate values will reset, but I feel good about the meaningful investment process.\u201dFor skeptics, the quick turnaround on real estate speculation might evoke the go-go thinking that led to the mortgage crisis just a decade ago. But investors say hard-money loans are more stable than a bank mortgage because they are secured by properties at a lower loan-to-value ratio, a risk assessment used by lenders.The average loan-to-value ratio in the industry is about 55 percent, compared with 75 percent to 80 percent for a typical mortgage. This provides a substantial cushion to protect against a property\u2019s falling in value. It also ensures that developers do not walk away from the properties, because they have put a substantial amount of their own money into a project.\u201cWhen the loan matures \u2014 let\u2019s say it\u2019s 11 months \u2014 we want our borrower to be successful,\u201d said Stephen Pollack, the chief executive and president of Anchor Loans.If the developer runs into a problem, \u201cwe\u2019ll try to help them come up with a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll ask them to put a tenant in there and take out a rental loan. But if the risk of the loan has changed and it\u2019s at a higher leverage amount, we want to do something to get us in a safer position.\u201dIn other words, the developer needs to put more money in, which Mr. Pollack said most of them agree to because they want to continue their relationship with Anchor.And because the length of the loan is shorter than a mortgage, the risk is smaller.\u201cThere\u2019s an asset bubble in stocks and a bond rally,\u201d said Shannon L. Saccocia, managing director of Boston Private Wealth. \u201cIs this creating the opportunity for another bubble in real estate? The reality is for us, given the short duration of the loans, they\u2019re easy for us to monitor. They\u2019re very different from securitization.\u201dTo make their portfolios more stable, some lenders diversify across several states so they are not stuck in one market or move into different types of real estate, like retail and land.\u201cThe benefit for a high-net-worth investor coming in is, they\u2019re instantly diversified,\u201d said Joseph L. Schocken, president of Broadmark Capital. \u201cAnd to have that kind of diversified portfolio producing the yield we\u2019ve produced \u2014 roughly 11 percent \u2014 is very unusual. What will get your attention is the stability.\u201dHis firm runs two funds and is about to start a third. All three focus on booming cities like Atlanta, Denver and Seattle. He said his goal was to make the book of loans as transparent as possible.The average loan varies in size depending on the lender, ranging from several hundred thousand to $15 million. At Rubicon Mortgage Fund, loans average $800,000 to $1 million. Douglas C. Watson, a principal at the firm, said that although Rubicon was focused on the San Francisco Bay Area, it had diversified into retail, storage and land.Hard-money lenders boast of the speed in which they finance loans, typically in less than a week, compared with several months for a traditional bank. For the smaller builders and house flippers who rely on these loans to do business, the speed with which these lenders can have the money ready trumps the high interest rates they charge.Jeff Walker, a principal at Square One Homes in Renton, Wash., which builds multifamily homes in Seattle, said he had been using hard-money lenders for more than a decade. He has borrowed often from Broadmark and tries to laugh off the rates he gets \u2014 usually around 12 percent interest with 4 percentage points of fees for a one-year loan: \u201cThat\u2019s outrageous, but what are you going to do?\u201dIt\u2019s the company\u2019s timeliness that matters to him when he needs to move quickly in the hot Seattle real estate market.\u201cI can say, I\u2019ll close on it within 48 hours, and I can get them to help me do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can compete against a cash buyer, even though I\u2019m not a cash buyer.\u201dBut even Mr. Walker, who said he typically made 35 to 40 percent return on his projects, is cautious that too much of a good thing can be, well, too much.\u201cSeattle is a booming market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come to an end at some point, but why not make it while you can?\u201dInvestors seem undaunted by the risk of a collapse.Richard Mulcahy, president of the Washington division of Northwest Bank, said he had started investing his personal money in hard-money loans after seeing how well the builders did with the loans.\u201cThe vast majority of builders could graduate to the national bank stage, but many are willing to pay that cost of credit because they know they can get a loan,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulcahy said he had invested about 50 percent of his wealth in one of the Broadmark funds. \u201cVarious people who are professionals in the industry, including one of my sons, say it\u2019s too high,\u201d he said. \u201cIt speaks to my absolute feeling of security and the way they\u2019ve set up the fund,\u201d which has no debt and invests only in first mortgages.Goldman Sachs\u2019s acquisition of Genesis Capital might demonstrate the evolution of the industry.The firm had expanded rapidly after a 2014 investment of at least $250 million from Oaktree Capital Management that Genesis used to buy out its early, individual investors and grow nationally, said Rayman Mathoda, co-chief executive of Genesis.Ms. Mathoda said the company focused now on small to midsize real estate businesses, not individual borrowers.\u201cA lot of folks make the mistake of thinking of this as a \u2018once in a cycle\u2019 opportunity when real estate is booming,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s driven by the metropolitan areas. We\u2019re improving the super-aged housing stock in America.\u201dBut the business is still driven by wealthy investors able to meet minimum investments of $100,000 or more.\u201cIn these markets, the risks feel reasonable,\u201d Mr. Gutek said. \u201cIf Seattle\u2019s real estate is cratering, the stock market has already cratered.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the name of a money lender focused on the San Francisco Bay Area. It is Rubicon Mortgage Fund, not Rubicon Mortgage Lending.Advertisement"}

By late in the afternoon of Oct. 19, the momentous nature of that day was already clear: The stock market had fallen more than 20 percent. It was the biggest one-day drop, in percentage terms, in the annals of the modern American market.I realized at once that this was a once-in-a lifetime research opportunity. So I worked late that night and the next, designing a questionnaire that would reveal investors\u2019 true thinking.Those were the days before widespread use of the internet, so I relied on paper and ink and old-fashioned snail mail. Within four days, I had mailed out 3,250 questionnaires to a broad range of individual and institutional investors. The response rate was 33 percent, and the survey provided a wealth of information.The report went on to say that the \u201cinitial decline ignited mechanical, price-insensitive selling by a number of institutions employing portfolio insurance strategies and a small number of mutual fund groups reacting to redemptions.\u201dThe Brady Commission found that portfolio insurance accounted for substantial selling on Oct. 19, but the commission could not know how much of this selling would have happened in a different form if portfolio insurance had never been invented.In fact, portfolio insurance was just a repackaged version of the age-old practice of selling when the market started to fall. With hindsight, it\u2019s clear that it was neither a breakthrough discovery nor the main cause of the decline.In that survey, I asked respondents to evaluate a list of news articles that appeared in the days before the market collapse, and to add articles that were on their minds on that day.I asked how important these were to \u201cyou personally,\u201d as opposed to \u201chow others thought about them.\u201d What is fascinating about their answers is what was missing from them: Nothing about market fundamentals stood out as a justification for widespread selling or for staying out of the market instead of buying on the dip. (Such purchases would have bolstered share prices.)Furthermore, individual assessments of news articles bore little relation to whether people bought or sold stocks that day.Instead, it appears that a powerful narrative of impending market decline was already embedded in many minds. Stock prices had dropped in the preceding week. And on the morning of Oct. 19, a graphic in The Wall Street Journal explicitly compared prices from 1922 through 1929 with those from 1980 through 1987.In short, my survey indicated that Oct. 19, 1987, was a climax of disturbing narratives. It became a day of fast reactions amid a mood of extreme crisis in which it seemed that no one knew what was going on and that you had to trust your own gut feelings.Given the state of communications then, it is amazing how quickly the panic spread. As my respondents told me on their questionnaires, most people learned of the market plunge through direct word of mouth.I first heard that the market was plummeting while lecturing to my morning class at Yale. A student in the back of the room was listening to a miniature transistor radio with an earphone, and interrupted me to tell us all about the market.Right after class, I walked to my broker\u2019s office at Merrill Lynch in downtown New Haven, to assess the mood there. My broker appeared harassed and busy, and had time enough only to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201dHe was right for long-term investors: The market began rising later that week, and in retrospect, stock charts show that buy-and-hold investors did splendidly if they stuck to their strategies. But that\u2019s easy to say now.Like the 2016 airport stampede, the 1987 stock market fall was a panic caused by fear and based on rumors, not on real danger. In 1987, a powerful feedback loop from human to human \u2014 not computer to computer \u2014 set the market spinning.We will have panics but not an exact repeat of Oct. 19, 1987. In one way, the situation has probably gotten worse: Technology has made viral rumor transmission much easier. But there are regulations in place that were intended to forestall another one-day market collapse of such severity.That should not be understood as a prediction that the market will have another great fall, however. It is simply an acknowledgment that such events involve the human psyche on a mass scale. We should not be surprised if they occur or even if, for a protracted period, the market remains remarkably calm. We are at risk, but with luck, another perfect storm \u2014 like the one that struck on Oct. 19, 1987 \u2014 might not happen in the next 30 years.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Report Calls for Sweeping Changes to Financial Rules", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration is again taking aim at the Dodd-Frank Act, releasing a Treasury Department report on Friday that recommended a vast reworking of Wall Street rules adopted in response to the financial crisis.Some of the proposed overhauls would do away with a requirement for companies to divulge the pay ratio of chief executives to workers, streamline derivatives rules, and give companies more access to capital and investors more places to put their money.The ideas were welcomed on Wall Street, where banks complain that Dodd-Frank rules have needlessly hobbled growth. But they attracted skepticism from consumer groups and others, who consider the suggestions a dangerous relaxation of checks against a cavalier financial system.Both the June report and the one released on Friday \u2014 as well as two more expected in the coming months \u2014 originated from an executive order that President Trump signed in February asking Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reposition financial rules to better match the administration\u2019s aims.Rob Nichols, chief executive of the American Bankers Association, called the Treasury recommendations \u201cpractical, reasonable and achievable.\u201d\u201cMany of the recommendations in the report would make it easier to raise capital, meet the needs of bank customers operating domestically and abroad, and focus regulatory processes on effective supervision without harming the economy,\u201d Mr. Nichols said in a statement.Among its proposals, Treasury recommended increasing the amount that can be raised in a crowdfunding offering, to $5 million from $1 million. The department, which also said it hoped to encourage more companies to pursue initial public offerings, pointed out that the number of publicly traded companies had declined by nearly 50 percent in the past two decades.Treasury also addressed rules that require companies to disclose payments associated with foreign resource extraction and the presence of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d from war-racked regions in Africa in their products. It said the rules, which are backed by human rights groups, should be repealed or limited to large, mature companies.The report touched on the costs of securities litigation, suggesting more research into arbitration as a way for companies and shareholders to resolve disputes. The document also asked for stronger regulation of the clearinghouses that operate as middlemen between buyers and sellers on Wall Street.Mike Calhoun, the president of the Center for Responsible Lending, said he was skeptical of claims that regulations stifle the economy, pointing to high profits and substantial share buybacks by banks as evidence that the institutions are \u201cawash in cash these days.\u201dThe Treasury report is \u201cmore strategic\u201d than other efforts to scale back oversight, but it is \u201cstill the wrong prescription for expanding the economy, and a dangerous one,\u201d he said.The report said the Securities and Exchange Commission and the futures trading commission should be evaluated for any \u201cregulatory overlaps and opportunities for harmonization.\u201d\u201cWe look forward to working alongside other financial regulators and Congress as we pursue our three-part mission to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation,\u201d he said.J. Christopher Giancarlo, who became the chairman of the futures trading commission in August, echoed the sentiment in his own statement, saying the recommendations would \u201cfoster financially sound markets in a way that encourages broad-based economic growth.\u201dSome of the report\u2019s suggestions will require legislative action, but many can simply be adopted as new policies by regulatory agencies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Says Reduction of Bond Portfolio Going Well", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday night that the Fed is making \u201cgood progress\u201d in reducing its vast portfolio of bond holdings, the most recent stage in the central bank\u2019s gradual unwinding of its post-crisis economic stimulus program.Ms. Yellen said a safe retreat was a crucial step in establishing that similar measures could be used to respond to future economic downturns.\u201cThe bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional tools might have to be used again,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in a speech to the National Economists Club.The Fed announced in September it would begin to reduce its $4 trillion portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities. It plans to shed $10 billion per month during the final quarter of 2017, then increase the pace by $10 billion every three months until it reaches a monthly rate of $50 billion.The Fed bought the bonds during and after the 2008 financial crisis as part of its broader campaign to revive economic growth by reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. As it sheds the bonds, it expects interest rates to rebound gradually.The Fed is also considering when to raise its benchmark interest rate again. Investors expect a quarter-point increase at the Fed\u2019s final meeting of the year in December. Ms. Yellen did not address those plans on Friday, but she has previously indicated she favors such an increase barring unexpected economic disruptions.President Trump said on Friday that he is still considering whether to appoint Ms. Yellen to a second term as chairwoman. Her current four-year term ends in early February.\u201cI really like her a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox Business Network.Mr. Trump said he is also considering two other candidates: Jerome H. Powell, a Republican member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, and John Taylor, an economist at Stanford University who has accused the Fed of raising interest rates too slowly.Mr. Trump\u2019s short list did not include two other men previously mentioned as candidates: Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor.The Fed\u2019s bond purchases have generated considerable controversy. Critics, including Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh, argued at the time that the Fed was trying too hard to revive growth, and that it was instead stoking the fires of inflation. Those criticisms proved to be misplaced. Others argue the purchases were simply ineffective.Ms. Yellen said Friday, as she has previously, that the purchases helped jump-start the economy.\u201cThe evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities purchases \u2014 by substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions of American families and businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodative \u2014 did help spur consumption and business spending, lower the unemployment rate, and stave off disinflationary pressures,\u201d she said.She added, however, that the Fed still needed to show that it could end the program.\u201cWe have met the first challenge and have made good progress to date in meeting the second,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The Fed is not selling its bond holdings. As the bonds mature, it has used the proceeds to buy new bonds. Now it is gradually reducing the reinvestment, removing the rest of the money from circulation.Ms. Yellen also defended a law that allows the Fed to pay interest on some of the money that banks deposit at the Fed.Congressional Republicans have criticized those payments as an unnecessary subsidy to the financial industry. But Ms. Yellen said the law enabled the Fed to manage its retreat.As the Fed bought bonds from banks, it paid them by increasing their reserve balances. That made it impossible to raise interest rates in the traditional manner, which is based on the scarcity of those reserves.The Fed could have reversed the process and then started raising rates, but it feared that doing so would disrupt financial markets. Instead, the Fed has raised rates by paying banks not to use the reserves.And that, in turn, allows the Fed to reduce its bond holdings slowly and smoothly.Ms. Yellen took a measured line on the potential impact of tax cuts on the course of monetary policy.In response to a question from the audience, she described fiscal policy as \u201cone of many factors\u201d that might influence the Fed\u2019s plans. The Fed could seek to offset a large fiscal stimulus by raising interest rates more quickly, but Ms. Yellen suggested that depended on details of the tax plan.The Fed is likely to be more concerned about policies that stimulate aggregate demand, while it would welcome policies that increase the economy\u2019s capacity for growth, for example, by expanding participation in the labor force, or encouraging investment.\u201cMy personal hope is that whatever Congress passes is rich in incentive effects on the supply side,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Big Question in Riyadh: The Status of Aramco\u2019s I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 It\u2019s a big week for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. For the first time since his elevation as heir to the kingdom, he will play host to a gathering of the global investing elite. Heavyweights from SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son to United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are rolling into this city to see firsthand his plans to make the city a regional financial powerhouse. Hanging over the affairs will be the status of the biggest deal in capital-markets history: the debut of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company on public markets.Since the so-called Future Investment Initiative came together a few months ago under the auspices of Saudi\u2019s enormous Public Investment Fund, questions about the viability of a planned $100 billion initial public offering of stock in Saudi Aramco, as the national oil company is known, have intensified. Chief among them is the difficulty of reaching the $2 trillion valuation for the group that the ruling family wants, according to news stories. Last week, Reuters reported that China offered to buy 5 percent of Aramco in a deal that could circumvent an offering.The snag with the Chinese option is that Saudi Arabia has other objectives beyond raising cash to fatten the kingdom\u2019s finances and fund social welfare. The Aramco offering is a key step toward making Riyadh a regional, if not international, capital for capital. It is part of the crown prince\u2019s blueprint for reducing Saudi Arabia\u2019s reliance on oil \u2014 a feat never fully achieved by a major resource economy in the modern era.As noted in a report by State Street Global Advisors on the eve of the investment initiative gathering, which began Tuesday, \u201cthe Saudi Aramco transaction should be leveraged in a much more significant way to change the relationship between the Saudi kingdom, the stewards of the economy, its citizens and the international investment community.\u201dThe crown prince is banking on Riyadh\u2019s appeal as a financial hub to meet the extraordinary ambitions of his Vision 2030 plan to move away from hydrocarbons \u2014 wise given the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles \u2014 toward other industries, including financial services. Transforming the $700 billion economy and better sharing the wealth with 33 million subjects, two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30, is of existential importance for the Saudi monarchy.Market authorities have taken strides to make the Tadawul, the Saudi stock market, an easier place for foreigners to buy shares and even short them. As a result, Saudi stocks are being considered for inclusion in indexes widely followed by investment professionals. The FTSE Russell in Britain is mulling whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging-market status. So is the American index provider MSCI, which will decide by next June whether to include Saudi shares in its MSCI Emerging Markets Index. If it does, the country\u2019s weighting, at around 2.4 percent according to State Street, could lead to inflows of around $38 billion.But the big numbers are those associated with privatizations, with Aramco top of the list. Speaking to Reuters, Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, the Saudi vice minister for economy and planning, estimated there could be $200 billion forthcoming from the sale of various assets like housing, water, telecommunications and even religious-tourism services.Beyond bringing in foreign direct investment, selling shares to the Saudi public could tighten the monarchy\u2019s grip on the hearts, minds and wallets of its people. As State Street observes in its report, such deals could involve a national privatization fund, which like a mutual fund could be offered to citizens at a discount, minimizing \u201cpublic controversies over the sale of public assets.\u201d In effect, it might foster a sense of inclusive capitalism, neutralizing criticism of the royal family\u2019s excesses, like the $500 million Italian yacht the crown prince acquired, according to news reports.Other innovations could include increased transparency about the ownership of assets that are, effectively, the state\u2019s patrimony. If Aramco incorporates good governance into its bylaws that, too, could help nurture an ownership culture among Saudis and reduce any mistrust of the ruling family. From this could follow other benefits, like the creation of a fixed-income market, albeit one compliant with sharia standards on lending and usury. That in turn would let banks off the hook for much of the risk while channeling capital to small and medium-size enterprises, and away from state juggernauts.The Future Investment Initiative gathering started with a welcome from the crown prince followed by a panel that includes the Aramco chief executive, Amir Nasser. They need to sound convincing that the I.P.O. of the biggest company ever to go public is on track. If the sale of the oil group is delayed or diverted, it would make the rest of Saudi\u2019s Vision 2030 looks increasingly cloudy, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Investors Can\u2019t Get Enough of Tajikistan\u2019s Debt", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For decades, it\u2019s been a rite of autumn: Finance ministers and central bankers from economically struggling countries arrive here for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s meetings, seeking cash infusions or bailouts from the world\u2019s richest nations.Now that tradition is being upended. Countries like Ukraine, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan still need the money. They\u2019ve just found a much more relaxed lender: investors who, in an era of rock-bottom interest rates, are searching far and wide for risky assets that will churn out decent returns.So, while government officials from those countries dutifully attended their meetings at I.M.F. headquarters last week, submitting to the usual lectures about keeping their spending in check, their bigger priority was pitching their debts to major investors at packed conferences organized by J. P. Morgan, Bank of America and the Institute of International Finance, the trade group for the global banking industry.\u201cNigeria is ready for business,\u201d said Okwu Joseph Nnanna, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, who urged a room of investors at one gathering to take advantage of the rich interest rates attached to his country\u2019s government bonds.The governor of the central bank of Egypt, Tarek Amer, was even more bullish. He bragged to the crowd of financiers that Egypt\u2019s tough economic reforms and stable currency had lured billions of dollars into the country.\u201cInvestors are feeling good \u2014 we have had $20 billion come into Egypt over the past year,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe money is pouring in.\u201d\u201cThese easy financial conditions might last for a while, but the longer they last the more the vulnerabilities build up,\u201d said Tobias Adrian, who heads the I.M.F.\u2019s monetary and capital markets division. \u201cThe impulse is to lever up when times are good, and we want to lean against that.\u201dEmerging market stocks and bonds have been popular with investors for nearly a year now, because of successful economic reforms and stable currencies.But the rush into the bonds of higher-risk developing nations shows just how short memories can be in the financial world.Mongolia, for example, was a darling of the investment community before commodity prices collapsed in 2014 and 2015. Now the country\u2019s bonds are being restructured because the government is short of funds. And it was not that long ago that Greece, even with its towering debt load, was an investor favorite.Ground zero for this mash-up between finance ministers flogging bonds and yield-starved investors looking to buy them was the lobby of the Mayflower Hotel in downtown Washington.That was where Joyce Chang, J. P. Morgan\u2019s head of global research and a pioneer in emerging market bond investing, was holding the investment bank\u2019s traditional bond jamboree, timed to coincide with the fund\u2019s twice-a-year meetings.Harried central bankers and finance ministers rushed in and out of the hotel lobby, trailing entourages of aides and security guards as their black town cars idled by the curb. After the presentations, coifed hedge fund managers \u2014 when they were not tackling the buffet of grilled flank steak, chili lime chicken and dainty tarts \u2014 converged on them with questions.On Thursday, rooms overflowing with eager listeners heard pitches from the finance minister of Brazil, whose country\u2019s economy is recovering, and the head of the central bank of Argentina, which has become an investor favorite after it recently issued a bond that doesn\u2019t mature for 100 years. The response from the floor was ebullient, with one investor pressing Brazil\u2019s finance chief, Henrique Meirelles, on whether he planned to run for president.What distinguishes this emerging market bond rally from others, bankers and economists say, is the extent to which it is being led by less financially mature markets like the Ivory Coast, Iraq and Suriname, which in the past have relied on credit from institutions such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank to finance government spending initiatives.This year, lower-income emerging economies are expected to issue close to $10 billion in government bonds, according to the I.M.F., more than the past two years combined.Of all of them, a recent $500 million bond offering by Tajikistan, a landlocked former Soviet republic that has rarely interacted with global investors, was the most curious. Tajikistan is paying investors an interest rate of just over 7 percent for 10 years, and the deal was a quick and easy sell for the country\u2019s bankers, with demand several times the amount of money secured.The half-billion dollars raised is especially staggering when compared with the size of Tajikistan\u2019s economy. The cash influx represents 7 percent of its gross domestic product and dwarfs the $74 million the country holds in foreign exchange reserves.\u201cWe were all scratching our heads over that one,\u201d said Brett A. Rowley, an emerging market bond investor at TCW in Los Angeles, which passed on the Tajikistan bonds.For his part, Mr. Rowley loves Egyptian Treasury bills. He promoted them on an investor panel at the Institute of International Finance\u2019s conference, touting their mouthwatering yields and the strength of the Egyptian pound. After the panel, he cornered Mr. Amer, the Egyptian central bank head, and said, \u201cI told everyone: Buy more T bills!\u201dOther countries are looking to dig into this fertile ground.\u201cWe have seen a lot interest in Sri Lankan paper,\u201d said P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the deputy governor of the Sri Lankan central bank. So bullish are investors about Sri Lanka, Mr. Weerasinghe said, that some are even asking that the country issue 30-year bonds. Earlier this year, Sri Lanka sold $1.5 billion in 10-year bonds and Mr. Weerasinghe said there was investor demand for seven times that amount.Mr. Nnanna, Nigeria\u2019s deputy central bank governor, said he was gearing up for a round of meetings with Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and Bank of America.The Nigerian economy has been hit hard by the drop in the price of oil and is increasingly reliant on foreign borrowing to pay for government expenditures. Earlier this year, Nigeria issued a $1 billion, 15-year bond. Demand far outstripped supply. \u201cWe are ready to issue bonds for 20 years now,\u201d Mr. Nnanna said.In the past, these frenzies often ended in pain for all. Explaining why his bonds are a safe bet, Mr. Nnanna repeated a notorious maxim attributed to Walter B. Wriston, the chief executive of Citibank \u2014 made at the onset of the Latin American debt crisis in the early 1980s.\u201cSovereign nations don\u2019t go bankrupt,\u201d Mr. Nnanna said. \u201cAnd we are a sovereign nation.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the Egyptian currency.

And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.After allegations by one employee, several Weinstein Company directors expressed alarm \u2014 but were assured there was no need to investigate.Under one scenario being teased in the company\u2019s upper echelons, Weinstein\u2019s brother Bob will assume the leadership of the company along with David Glasser, the Weinstein Company\u2019s chief operating officer and president. It\u2019s unclear if Weinstein will be suspended or forced out of the company entirely.

In all of those cases, as in this case, the history of allegations has been an almost wholly open secret, sometimes even having been reported in major outlets, and yet somehow ignored, allowed to pass, unconsidered.President Trump plans to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, according to news reports.By declining to certify Iran\u2019s compliance, Mr. Trump would essentially kick it to Congress to decide whether to reimpose punitive economic sanctions. Even among Republicans, there appears to be little appetite to do that, at least for now.The economic angle:If the Trump administration\u2019s actions make European banks fearful of lending billions to Iran to build new refineries, or expand other economic links with the West, it may fuel opposition to the deal inside Iran.Sales of the firearm accessory that the Las Vegas gunman used to modify his rifles jumped this week, causing some companies to sell out of the so-called bump stocks even as Walmart and Cabela\u2019s stripped them from their websites.The rush to buy bump stocks started Wednesday, when gun enthusiasts expressed concern on social media that bump stocks would either sell out or become illegal after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives linked them to the Las Vegas attack.The surpriseWhat they agree onCorporate tax rates need to be cut because of global competition.

Many community banks used to offer payday-like loans but stopped doing so in 2013 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a key banking regulator, issued a bulletin discouraging the products. On Thursday, the office unexpectedly repealed that guidance, citing the new consumer bureau rules.The lender was accused of paying about 300 female employees less than men in the same positions.It also faced allegations that it paid 15 black executives less than white employees in the same positions.State Street, a financial services firm, denies the allegations, according to the agreement.

{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Amazon Book Battle", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook News\u201cI want to beat them,\u201d said Mark Rubbo, Readings\u2019 co-owner, discussing Amazon as he stared across Lygon Street to where Borders used to be. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of this monolith devouring everything.\u201dBut changing Australians\u2019 reading habits may be more of a challenge. Books are bellwethers of great symbolic weight, not just because they were Amazon\u2019s first product and because the company often uses them to wedge itself into new markets, but also because books and bookstores are tightly linked to Australia\u2019s sense of itself, and to the country\u2019s beloved ecosystem of local commerce.This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school.Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia\u2019s book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States.Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they\u2019ll eventually embrace and come to love.Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon\u2019s arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia\u2019s own writing, and way of life.\u201cOur culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,\u201d Mr. Rubbo said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to defend our voice.\u201dAmazon\u2019s first \u201cfulfillment center\u201d in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products.Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia\u2019s minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom.What comes next is anyone\u2019s guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions.Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn\u2019t explained why it\u2019s taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon\u2019s American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne.Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia\u2019s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers\u2019 hands, in some cases on the same day they\u2019re ordered.\u201cIt\u2019s not about price,\u201d Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, \u201cit\u2019s about the logistics.\u201dBut isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt.For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work.\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people like supporting local businesses.\u201d\u201cI would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,\u201d he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne.But just below his own bookish calm \u2014 and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books \u2014 there are wider concerns.In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged.One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia\u2019s big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers\u2019 orders at the end of the line.The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia\u2019s labor, tax and import laws in its favor.Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected.But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia\u2019s literary culture.The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books.Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation.\u201cWhat makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,\u201d said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: \u201cIt\u2019s a retrograde move.\u201dInside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see.Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent?\u201cWe have a lot of questions,\u201d said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years.He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone.The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia\u2019s well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere.Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. \u201cI like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn\u2019t find otherwise,\u201d said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening.Amazon\u2019s deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price.Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers. She said she was told not to fret. \u201cThey were giving me a bit of a pep talk really,\u201d she said.But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent. Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment. Michael Gordon-Smith, the chief executive of the Australian Publishers Association, sent a statement by email: \u201cWe welcome any new ways to get books to Australian readers and any new investment in the Australian industry that is consistent with good corporate citizenship and respect for creators\u2019 rights.\u201dMs. Wilson and Mr. Rubbo both said that Amazon\u2019s power could bend the will of even the well-intentioned. In their nightmares, they see declining revenues, shuttered stores and silent, dying neighborhoods.\u201cIt\u2019s really crucial that these places survive and thrive,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cI wish I was more optimistic.\u201dTacey Rychter contributed reporting from Sydney.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Open to Banning \u2018Bump Stocks\u2019 Used in Massacre", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a generation, Republicans in Congress \u2014 often joined by conservative Democrats \u2014 have bottled up gun legislation, even as the carnage of mass shootings grew ever more gruesome and the weaponry ever more deadly. A decade ago, they blocked efforts to limit the size of magazines after the massacre at Virginia Tech. Five years later, Republican leaders thwarted bipartisan legislation to expand background checks of gun purchasers after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Last year, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub massacre, they blocked legislation to stop gun sales to buyers on terrorism watch lists.\u201cI own a lot of guns, and as a hunter and sportsman, I think that\u2019s our right as Americans, but I don\u2019t understand the use of this bump stock,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said, adding, \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s an obvious area we ought to explore and see if it\u2019s something Congress needs to act on.\u201dMr. Cornyn said the continuing legality of the conversion kits was \u201ca legitimate question,\u201d and told reporters he had asked Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, to convene a hearing on that issue and any others that arise out of the Las Vegas investigation.Other Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, said they would be open to considering legislation on bump stocks.\u201cWe certainly want to learn more details on what occurred in Las Vegas,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, \u201cand if there are vulnerabilities in federal law that we should be addressing to prevent such attacks in the future, we would always be open to that.\u201dIn the House, Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, said he was drafting bipartisan legislation banning the conversion kits. Representative Mark Meadows, the head of the conservative Freedom Caucus, also said he would be open to considering a bill, while Representative Bill Flores, Republican of Texas, called for an outright ban.In an often deadlocked Washington, none of the pronouncements guaranteed action. The National Rifle Association, which has poured tens of millions of dollars into Republican campaign coffers, remained mum on the bump stock discussion and could stop it cold.And Erich Pratt, executive director of another gun rights group, Gun Owners of America, vowed to block any legislation.\u201cWe see this as an item that is certainly protected by the Second Amendment, and realistically, they are already on the market, so passing a law banning them isn\u2019t going to stop bad guys like this creep in Las Vegas,\u201d he said.But Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat, tried to force the issue, introducing legislation, backed by about two dozen Democrats, that would ban bump stocks.Ms. Feinstein cautioned that bipartisan support for such narrow legislation would hardly constitute a sea change. She tried to ban bump stocks in 2013, but that was part of broader legislation to renew the assault weapons ban, which went nowhere.\u201cI mean, if not this, what?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a weapon away. It just means you can\u2019t convert it into something it\u2019s not meant to be.\u201dAt a hastily convened news conference, Ms. Feinstein said the Las Vegas massacre, which left 58 people dead and about 500 injured at a country music festival Sunday night, had hit home with her. Her daughter had planned to attend the concert but decided against going at the last minute.\u201cBump stocks\u201d are attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster, almost like machine guns. Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.Ms. Feinstein, who has spent years shepherding gun safety legislation \u2014 almost always unsuccessfully \u2014 said she introduced the measure on the advice of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who reasoned that by offering a narrowly tailored provision, she might get Republican support.Bump stocks replace a rifle\u2019s standard stock, which is the part held against the shoulder, freeing the weapon to slide back and forth rapidly, harnessing the energy from the kickback that shooters feel when the weapon fires. The stock \u201cbumps\u201d back and forth between the shooter\u2019s shoulder and trigger finger, causing the rifle to rapidly fire again and again, far faster than an unaided finger can pull a trigger.The Las Vegas gunman fired down on concertgoers from the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel. With his fixed firing positions and distance from his victims, he almost certainly was more lethal because of the conversion kits. But until the shooting, many lawmakers said, they had never heard of bump stocks.The devices were introduced during the past decade by Bump Fire and Slide Fire, both based in Moran, Tex., near Abilene. Bump Fire\u2019s website appeared to be down for much of Wednesday. The company wrote on its Facebook page on Tuesday that its servers had been overwhelmed by \u201chigh traffic volume.\u201dMultiple items on Slide Fire\u2019s site on Wednesday featured the notice, \u201cDue to extreme high demands, we are currently out of stock.\u201dBump Fire sells stocks for an AK-47 and an AR-15 for $99.99 each. Slide Fire\u2019s stocks are priced between $140 and $300. Neither company responded to a request for comment.On Gunbroker.com, an auction site for firearms and shooting accessories, at least three dozen listings featuring bump stocks had attracted multiple bids.Zack Cernok, a Pennsylvania gun owner, was one of those trying to buy a Bump Fire bump stock.\u201cI don\u2019t even have the gun for it, but I want the stock just to have it down the line,\u201d he said. \u201cI just like the idea of them and want to see how it feels and if it\u2019s worth it \u2014 for $100, it\u2019s almost not a bad investment to buy it, try it out and sell it if I don\u2019t like it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Market Bonds Are on a Roll. But How High Is the Risk?", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has been nearly two years since the Federal Reserve began to raise its core interest rate, yet income investors in the United States are still waiting for a tailwind to kick in.Those who are willing to bear additional risk might turbocharge their returns with emerging market bond funds, an often ignored slice of the fixed income sector that lately has delivered a combination of high yield and high total returns.Valuations are stretched after average gains of nearly 25 percent since early 2016, and rising rates in the United States would hurt bond prices. Yet many emerging market bond fund managers make a bullish case.These fund managers do not expect the Fed\u2019s actions to muck up the landscape.The upshot is that even if rates rise in the United States, emerging markets can remain appealing as long as the global economic outlook remains positive because they offer higher yields.Consider that investment-grade United States bonds with a five-year maturity currently yield 2.4 percent and that comparable eurozone bonds yield less than 1 percent. Yet similar-term bonds from India, Indonesia and Mexico have yields of at least 6.5 percent.What may appeal to institutional clients requires careful consideration for 401(k) savers. The geopolitical risk that comes with investing in emerging markets means such fixed-income investments are not equivalent to those held in prudent, high-grade, core United States bond funds.Beyond the risks within specific countries, China, a major trade partner for other emerging markets, casts a long shadow. If China has problems, other countries probably will, too.If you have not paid attention to emerging markets for a long while \u2014 since the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, for example, or the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s \u2014 it is worth noting that many countries have far more stable economic and monetary policies today.Many nations now allow their currencies to float, rather than be artificially fixed. They hold much more foreign currency, which may help the next time foreign investors rush for the exits. And their central banks have a stronger hand on the rudder.Countries that relied on external trade and investor demand a few decades ago now have growing, consumer-driven, domestic markets and increasing local investment, along with revised economic and monetary policies.\u201cThe label \u2018emerging markets\u2019 is almost unfortunate,\u201d Mr. Muaddi of T. Rowe Price said. \u201cIt\u2019s a label from 25 years ago when emerging markets were 15 countries.\u201dToday, he said, there are 70 emerging market countries, including established ones and their outlier cousins in so-called frontier markets, and all of them have their own idiosyncratic characteristics. \u201cTajikistan is not Indonesia,\u201d Mr. Muaddi said.Emerging market debt can be issued in local currency, or in a hard \u201cexternal\u201d currency. That is probably code for dollars, although some emerging market debt is tied to euros or Japanese yen. Even with the recent slide in the dollar, Ms. Vandersteel of GMO said, \u201clocal currencies are still cheap.\u201dBut predicting currency trends is one of the riskiest aspects of emerging market investing. And when the dollar rises, local-currency bonds tend to suffer. From 2013 through the end of 2015, the dollar gained 25 percent against a basket of currencies, and the average emerging market local currency bond fund lost 23 percent, according to Morningstar.Ms. Jones recommended that investors limit all noncore bond investments to around 10 percent of their fixed-income portfolio.\u201cRisks exist,\u201d she said, warning that volatility in emerging market bonds could be severe. \u201cThis is not a short-term trade at this level,\u201d she said. You need an investment horizon of at least five years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s President Says Election Gains Bolster His Reform Plan", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Macri\u2019s alliance \u2014 Cambiemos, or Let\u2019s Change \u2014 exceeded analysts\u2019 projections for Sunday\u2019s vote, becoming the first party since 1985 to win in Argentina\u2019s five largest electoral districts. It picked up nine seats in the Senate and 21 in the lower house of Congress, bolstering its count in the legislature, though Cambiemos remains a minority bloc.But over all, Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s party did poorly, underscoring how weak Peronism, the dominant political force here for decades, has become in the Macri era, largely as a result of internal divisions.And more broadly, the gains by the Macri alliance appeared to be another setback for the left in Latin America. In Brazil, the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in 2016 brought an end to 13 years in power by the Workers\u2019 Party. And in Chile, former President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, a conservative, appears to have a comfortable lead in the race to replace the center-left president, Michelle Bachelet, next year.Seeking to capitalize quickly on Sunday\u2019s results, Mr. Macri said he would call the country\u2019s governors, key lawmakers and leaders in the judiciary to accelerate progress on labor and tax policy overhauls, his priorities. The message appeared intended to reassure investors who have long complained about the difficulty of doing business in Argentina.\u201cThe government wants to create a system to promote employment,\u201d said Fausto Spotorno, the chief economist at Orlando Ferreres & Asociados. \u201cToday it\u2019s so expensive and risky to hire people in Argentina that there is a high rate of unemployment, and the under-the-table economy is huge.\u201dAccelerating Mr. Macri\u2019s agenda carries significant political risks, analysts say, because the government\u2019s plan to cut Argentina\u2019s deficit \u2014 currently about 4.2 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 will require unpopular cost-cutting measures.\u201cThe government is putting forward an agenda of reforms that are essential but carry important political costs,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, a political commentator. \u201cSo the plan will be based on gradualism. Every day we\u2019ll see something new.\u201d Mr. Berensztein pointed out that high public spending was one of the keys to Mr. Macri\u2019s electoral success.Sunday\u2019s election was a high point in the rise of a young political brand that came into power two years ago when Mr. Macri, a former mayor of Buenos Aires, won the presidency by billing himself as the new face of Argentine politics. It leaves him as a rare powerful and relatively popular president in a region where several other large countries are currently led by deeply unpopular lame-duck leaders.Mr. Macri\u2019s candidate in the Buenos Aires Province, which is home to nearly 40 percent of the electorate, won a four-point victory over Mrs. Kirchner.Mrs. Kirchner went on a charm offensive in the final stretch of the campaign, dialing down on the defiant style that has come to characterize her politics. She billed herself as the best hope of \u201cputting the brakes\u201d on what she called Mr. Macri\u2019s austerity policies. On Monday, she was notably silent.Analysts said that divisions that had emerged in the opposition would make it easier for the government to seal the necessary alliances to get legislation through Congress.\u201cThe truth is that Peronism has never been this weak,\u201d said Mariel Fornoni, director of Management and Fit, a political consultancy. \u201cIt has gone through low points before, but the main difference now is that it doesn\u2019t have any clear leadership and the person who is claiming to be its leader is rejected by a large segment of society.\u201dMr. Maldonado\u2019s disappearance became a rallying cry for the opposition, and snap opinion polls suggested that the discovery of his body would hurt Mr. Macri at the ballot box. But preliminary autopsy results, announced Friday, suggested that Mr. Maldonado drowned and had no visible bruises on his body.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the preliminary autopsy, Macri would have surely lost a few points,\u201d Ms. Fornoni said.On Monday, Mr. Macri vowed to \u201ccontinue supporting the judiciary to find out the truth about what happened\u201d to Mr. Maldonado.Advertisement"}

The smattering of slimy husks is a common sight underfoot in the fall, when the Lapides offer wine grapes shipped in from California.After sampling for sweetness \u2014 and conferring with his daughter and son-in-law \u2014 Mr. Buonocore, 82, settled on 10 boxes of red grapes and four boxes of white.Mr. Buonocore is a lifelong winemaker who moved to Astoria, Queens, from Naples, Italy, 50 years ago. He used to buy grapes in Astoria, but most of those providers have disappeared, said Mr. Buonocore\u2019s daughter, Patricia Argondizzo, 44.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d she said.The garden center is a hotbed for Italian immigrants during wine grape season. This year, the garden center\u2019s two-room refrigerator, which in the springtime keeps flowers from blooming too early, was stocked with more than 2,000 crates of grapes and 3,000 buckets of juice. Several stacks of grape crates \u2014 alicante, grenache, muscat \u2014 usually sit just outside the store, ready for purchase.As part of the Brooklyn Terminal Market at Foster and Remsen Avenues, the garden center, which in 1946 got its start as F & L Produce, has been in the Lapide family for the better part of 70 years. Although the Lapides are still a major distributor of watermelons, the garden center no longer stocks them.\u201cIf you drove by this market, you wouldn\u2019t want to come in,\u201d said the current owner Patrick Lapide, referring to the Terminal\u2019s drab exterior, which looks from the outside like an area meant strictly for wholesalers.But those who do take a moment to visit at this time of year will find multicolored mums and marigolds; ornamental peppers in oranges and yellows and reds; pumpkins in oranges and whites and greens; and gourds, with or without warts.There are annuals like celosia, whose velvety magenta and ivory folds look like the wrinkles of the human brain. There are fresh kitchen herbs and lengthy tables of desert flora.\u201cYou get good prices and the flowers are beautiful,\u201d said Mearl Campbell, 67, a neighborhood resident and a Plantology customer for three decades.Ms. Campbell was one of the few customers buying plants that day. Most people were there for the grapes.Joseph Morrone, 81, plucked grape after grape from the crates outside the shop. Extracting the juice through his teeth, Mr. Morrone decided the alicante tasted best; the variety would make for a strong, dark wine, he said.\u201cJoe! Joe!\u201d Mario Grimaldi, the grape salesman, called out from feet away. \u201cDid you bring the bread to eat with the grape, or you gonna eat a whole box of grapes? What the hell are you doing?\u201dMr. Morrone, who was born in Salerno, Italy, has been making wine for half a century. When it comes down to it, he said he usually buys the \u201ccheaper\u201d options.Mr. Grimaldi, who has worked at the garden center for 30 years, is not shy about his frustration with hagglers. And every customer is a haggler, he said.He stood behind a wooden table with Antonio Capricchionae, 79, as the two pored over prices on paper.\u201cUsually I get a free plant,\u201d said Mr. Capricchionae, who immigrated to the United States from Molise, Italy, in 1959 and now lives in East Rockaway, on Long Island.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a plant,\u201d said a frustrated Mr. Grimaldi between draws of his De Nobili cigar. Later, he would ask Mr. Capricchionae, \u201cWhat do you want, a fricking color TV?\u201dAs garden center employees loaded Mr. Capricchionae\u2019s car with 13 cases of grapes, Mr. Capricchionae picked up two dusty-rose-hued mums and studied them. When Mr. Grimaldi wasn\u2019t looking, he took both to his car, and drove away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Still Puzzled by Inflation, but Rate Increase Is on Track", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The persistence of slow inflation was the dominant topic at the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent policy-making meeting in September, but most officials were still inclined to raise the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate later this year.The account said that recent hurricanes had not disrupted that outlook. The Fed expects slower growth for a few months, but it does not expect a long-term effect.The Fed said after the September meeting that it would begin to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, which it accumulated beginning in 2008 as part of the effort to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The Fed is now shaving $10 billion from its portfolio each month. It will add another $10 billion to the monthly total each quarter next year, until it reaches a monthly pace of $50 billion.Ms. Yellen reviewed the reasons to worry about low inflation but concluded that the weight of evidence did not warrant a shift in the Fed\u2019s plans. \u201cGiven that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent,\u201d she said.But the minutes of the September meeting said that \u201ca few\u201d Fed officials opposed another 2017 rate move, and that \u201cseveral others\u201d remained on the fence.Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, is among the skeptics. \u201cThere\u2019s room for a very honest discussion later this year as to whether or not it\u2019s the right time to raise rates,\u201d Mr. Evans told Bloomberg News on Wednesday.The divisions are not about the economic outlook. The account noted that all participants agreed that economic activity during the summer months was in line with the Fed\u2019s expectations \u201cand that the incoming data had not materially altered the medium-term economic outlook.\u201dThe Fed expects the recent hurricanes to bring down the figures for third-quarter growth, but it anticipates a rebound in the fourth quarter and little impact from the storms going forward.The issue is the behavior of inflation. The Fed aims to keep inflation at an annual pace of about 2 percent, but it has undershot that goal consistently since the financial crisis, and the Fed says it expects to miss the target again this year.\u201cMany participants continued to believe that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market or an economy operating above its potential were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term,\u201d the account said.Those officials want to raise interest rates so long as the economy keeps growing.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s models tell them that an economy at full employment eventually produces more inflation down the road and they want the Fed funds rate to be back to normal levels before that happens,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.Some also want to raise rates because they are concerned that markets are not responding to the Fed\u2019s pressure. The Fed raises its benchmark rate to tighten financial conditions, including borrowing costs, but conditions have eased so far this year.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has fallen almost 5 percent this year; the decline was even deeper before it began to bounce back last month.The dissidents are less unified in their critiques. Some argue that employment has room to grow. The share of prime-age adults with jobs remains below the level before the recession. The account also pointed to the \u201cabsence of broad-based upward wage pressures.\u201dSome officials also see evidence that other factors may be weighing on inflation. The account noted that inflation is low in other advanced economies, and there has been some erosion in market expectations of future inflation, which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Those worries have occupied a larger portion of the official minutes with each passing meeting this year, reflecting the growing puzzlement and concern among officials. \u201cMany participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent,\u201d it said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Investors Support the Boards. But Few of Them Vote.", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameInstitutional investors have been flexing their muscles on corporate governance issues this year. So why do individual investors continue to be so disengaged on these matters?A recent analysis of investor voting at annual shareholder meetings highlights a striking contrast between the views of institutional investors and those of individuals. It was conducted by Broadridge Financial Solutions, a technology and data analytics firm and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditing and professional services firm, and it compared the votes of endowments, pension funds and mutual funds with those of retail investors at almost 3,400 annual meetings between Jan. 1 and June 30 of this year.The analysis found that even as more institutions are voting their shares against corporate management on environmental matters, executive pay and board diversity, individuals\u2019 votes are more likely to support the executives.On proposals aiming to improve board diversity, almost one-third of institutional shares were cast in support. But only 14 percent of retail investors\u2019 shares favored bringing more diversity to the ranks of corporate directors.The same split between institutions and individuals also emerged on the topic of questionable executive pay practices. At the 32 companies whose pay programs failed to win majority support from shareholders this year, individual investors were twice as likely as institutions to vote in favor of that compensation. Some 66 percent of individuals\u2019 shares were cast in support of companies whose pay plans failed to win majority approval, compared with 32 percent of institutions\u2019 shares.To a great degree, these figures reflect the fact that institutions hold the overwhelming portion of company shares \u2014 70 percent to individuals\u2019 30 percent, Broadridge data shows.But do the results prove that individual investors are pleased with the way corporations are managing governance matters? While executives might want to believe this, it\u2019s probably not the case, according to experts who study shareholder voting. They contend that for individual investors, the proxy voting system is onerous, frustrating and broken. A result, they say, is that annual vote tallies represent only a small portion of individual investors\u2019 shares and views.The Broadridge-PricewaterhouseCoopers study bears this out. It found that 91 percent of the shares owned by institutional investors \u2014 but only 29 percent of those held by individuals \u2014 were voted during the most recent proxy season on director elections and shareholder proposals covering the full array of governance issues.The main reason for this divergence is that institutions are generally required to vote their shares as part of their fiduciary duty to the investors or pension beneficiaries whose money they oversee. \u201cInstitutions vote at very high rates,\u201d said Chuck Callan, senior vice president for regulatory affairs at Broadridge, in an interview. \u201cRetail shareholders are not required to vote by law or regulation. Typically, the understanding has been that if these shareholders have a problem with a company, they vote with their feet.\u201d In other words, they sell their shares.But if you examine the results of almost any annual shareholder meeting, it also becomes clear that throngs of individual investors were absent this year in voting on directors and other governance issues.Most individuals keep their shares at their brokerage firms, but the brokers cannot vote them on the clients\u2019 behalf. Instead, the investors have to cast their votes by mail, on the phone or online. Those who fail to do so are categorized as broker nonvotes in regulatory filings.Even at troubled companies, this inertia can be widespread and surprising. At Wells Fargo\u2019s annual meeting in April, for example, when the company came under pressure for its questionable sales practices, roughly four billion shares were voted in the director elections. Broker nonvotes on those elections totaled almost 500 million shares.Institutional investors, meanwhile, have it easier when they vote their shares. They can take advantage of technological advancements in voting platforms that allow them to leave standing instructions on how they want their votes cast on particular proposals.\u201cBecause they have such a huge work flow, institutions will flag certain types of proposals and will develop guidelines on how they want to vote on them,\u201d Mr. Callan said. \u201cPlatforms for institutions integrate all that.\u201dBut proposals for a system that would allow individuals to leave standing instructions for the voting of their shares have gone nowhere. As Ms. Fisch noted, the commission has voiced concerns that such a system would require investors to make voting decisions before they had received proxy materials \u201ccontaining the disclosures mandated under the federal securities laws and possibly without consideration of the specific issues to be voted upon.\u201d The agency also warned that the availability of standing voting instructions might mean investors would not bother to read the proxy statement.Still, regulations have gotten in the way of what might be the natural market development of tools to encourage individual investor voting, Ms. Fisch said. \u201cWhen the voting platforms and proxy advisers work with institutional investors, they provide tools for categorizing issues and proposals to accommodate investor voting preferences even though the issues might differ a little,\u201d she added. \u201cI would envision a platform being able to provide retail investors that same sort of functionality.\u201dMs. Fisch and others are convinced that individual investors are interested in the makeup of corporate boards, executive pay and other governance matters. Given that technology can lower the hurdles these shareholders face in expressing their views, it seems unfair to ignore it.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yale Endowment, Often a Pacesetter, Is a Laggard This Time", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Yale endowment also trailed the mean one-year return \u2014 12.7 percent \u2014 of 450 institutions tracked by Cambridge Associates, which manages money in the nonprofit sector.Yale continues to diversify its holdings into hedge funds, where it has 25 percent of its assets, and venture capital, with a 17 percent stake, in addition to foreign equity, leveraged buyouts and real estate, as well as some bonds and cash. That diversification strategy, which Mr. Swensen pioneered, is widely followed by larger institutions.Welcome to the third annual College Access Index, a ranking of colleges based on their commitment to economic diversity.Indeed, the leaders of the M.I.T., Stanford and Princeton endowments \u2014 Seth Alexander, Robert F. Wallace and Andrew Golden, \u2014 all trained at Yale. The strategy of using outside managers to handle these diverse asset groups has been widely imitated.One holdout had long been Harvard, where a large chunk of the endowment was managed internally. But under its new chief, N. P. Narvekar, more of the funds will be overseen by outside firms as Harvard shrinks its own staff.The diversification approach at many of the largest endowments has generated some skepticism in an era when stock markets have been strong. But over a 20-year period ended June 7, Yale pointed out in its release Tuesday, the endowment produced an average annual return of 12.1 percent \u2014 outperforming domestic stocks, which returned 7.5 percent, and domestic bonds, which returned 5.2 percent.Endowments are a crucial component of university budgets. During the financial crisis of 2008, when many endowments plummeted in value, some schools had to cut spending significantly. Distributions from the Yale endowment to the operating budget have increased at an annualized rate of 9.2 percent over the past two decades. It is the university\u2019s largest source of revenue, and in the current fiscal year, it is expected to contribute $1.3 billion, roughly 34 percent of the university\u2019s operating budget.An article on Wednesday about the slowing growth of Yale University\u2019s endowment misstated part of the name of an organization that tracks investment returns in the nonprofit sector.

{"Headline": "Funds That Can Put Your Investments on a Low-Carbon Diet", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you care about climate change, your money can help shrink your carbon footprint. You can buy appliances that are more energy efficient or a hybrid or electric car \u2014 or, better yet, a bike. You can install thicker insulation in your home or solar panels on your roof.The smog has begun to clear. A spate of stock funds and E.T.F.s has appeared over the past several years that shun major fossil-fuel producers, like oil drillers and coal miners, or those with excessive greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide, spewed out mainly by the burning of fossil fuel, accounts for most of such emissions, so these new offerings often call themselves \u201clow carbon.\u201dFossil Free Funds sprang from Mr. Behar\u2019s effort to determine the carbon footprints of the funds in As You Sow\u2019s own retirement plan. The exercise showed him how tough it was to piece together the needed information. So he and a colleague, Andrew Montes, created the website, which began in 2015.The site combines Morningstar data on stock holdings with screens like the Carbon Underground 200, a global index of coal, natural gas and oil companies. If a user types, say, \u201cVanguard\u2019s S.&P. 500 index fund\u201d into the site\u2019s search box, a report is generated. That report shows that 21 companies, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, and 4.28 percent of the fund\u2019s total assets overlap with the Carbon Underground 200. That means, of $10,000 invested in the fund, $428 will end up in fossil-fuel stocks.\u201cWhat this fund is doing is giving investors the S.&P. 500 minus companies that own reserves of crude oil, natural gas and thermal coal that are economically and technically recoverable,\u201d said Christopher C. McKnett, who leads environmental, social and governance strategy for State Street Global Advisors, the E.T.F.\u2019s sponsor. The fund does not exclude reserves of metallurgical coal, which is used in the making of steel, but it does exclude utilities if they own their own reserves, he said. State Street created the E.T.F. for investors committed to divesting from fossil-fuel stocks, Mr. McKnett said.Several long-established sponsors of socially screened funds can also help put your portfolio on low-carb diet.When assembling the portfolios, Dimensional applies its usual financial metrics to companies, but it also assesses their emissions, Mr. Chi said. \u201cOur approach is to rank companies both on an absolute basis and against their peers,\u201d he said. The portfolio managers then eliminate the those with the worst emissions, de-emphasize the lesser performers and overweight the better ones. Dimensional\u2019s one absolute climate-related exclusion is coal companies.The list of climate sinners is longer at Parnassus Investments and Green Century Capital Management, two specialists in so-called socially responsible funds.A group of environmental nonprofits started Green Century in 1991 and it has long avoided the fossil-fuel industry, but its marketing did not highlight that until recently.\u201cWe didn\u2019t use the words \u2018fossil fuel free\u2019 till five years ago,\u201d Ms. Samuelrich said. \u201cBut the demand started to pick up, and we realized we should tell people. So we started promoting that, and since then, our assets have more than doubled,\u201d lately reaching $491 million for the company\u2019s three funds. Green Century also has a balanced fund that contains bonds as well as stocks.The variety of low-carbon stock funds makes it easier for people to invest this way. Whether they should invest this way, from a financial standpoint, remains a subject of debate. Investment orthodoxy says that limiting your pool of investments stunts your potential return.Jon F. Hale, director of sustainability research at Morningstar, said he doubted that people with well-diversified portfolios would see much of an impact on performance if they replaced, say, a conventional domestic, large-capitalization fund with a low-carbon one. A diverse portfolio, he said, would include funds spanning domestic and international markets, large- and small-capitalization stocks and developed and developing countries.Mr. Hale said the returns of the low-carbon fund would not track the broader market: If the energy sector were to surge, the fund would probably underperform. But, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility of a positive return, too.\u201d That could happen if the world\u2019s economy continues to move toward greater energy efficiency and a greater reliance on renewable sources like wind and solar power.Personal values have a place in investment decisions, Mr. Hale said, adding that some people viewed divestment from coal, gas and oil as a matter of morals, not money.\u201cI may be fine with the possibility of my portfolio performing a little less without fossil fuels because I want to add my voice to this movement or feel good about myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI may be willing trade off some of the other investment benefits for that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Old-School Investment Manager That Builds Wealth Quietly", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySan Francisco \u2014 In the hard-sell world of mutual funds, the art of pushing pricey investments is a source of pride for many executives.Not at Dodge & Cox.The old-school investment firm does virtually nothing to promote or market its six modestly priced, actively-managed mutual funds.To underscore his point, Mr. Pohl described a recent encounter with an executive from a rival fund company, whom he declined to identify. Mr. Pohl\u2019s peer proudly described the way that new technology allowed him to track, in real time, how its vast portfolio of mutual funds, and their many share classes, were selling across the country.Mr. Pohl was unimpressed.\u201cWe have no idea about this,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBut if you give me enough time I think I can name every single issuer of a bond or equity that we own.\u201dMr. Pohl did not rattle off the names of the 164 companies that Dodge & Cox, which manages $303 billion in assets, oversees in its portfolios. He was, however, quick to highlight the simplicity, parsimoniousness and devotion to disciplined value investing that distinguishes this traditionally minded investment firm from much of its industry.Founded in 1930 by two Depression-era bankers, Dodge & Cox has just six, single-class mutual funds, compared with an average of 464 for the largest 25 fund shops, according to Morningstar. Its fees are about half the industry average, Morningstar says. It has no sales force and says it has never paid to advertise its small stable of funds.If the indexing giant Vanguard were reincarnated as a pure stock-picking outfit, it might look a lot like Dodge & Cox: lean, cheap and not a little holier than thou.For years, fund companies that rely on active stock selection to churn out returns have been pummeled by investors switching over to lower-cost, better-performing index and exchange-traded funds. The portfolio managers at Dodge & Cox, stock pickers to their very core, have not been immune to these industry-shaking trends.Investors have been less than patient with such results. Since 2012, the Dodge & Cox Stock fund has had close to $10 billion in outflows, although the firm\u2019s other funds have had net inflows during that time.The Dodge & Cox Stock fund\u2019s five-year performance has been better. While many large capitalization mutual funds have struggled to keep pace with the surging Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which returned 14.2 percent, annualized, through September, Dodge & Cox Stock was up 15.6 percent, according to Morningstar. That put the fund in the top 2 percent of its category.While other fund companies with an active \u2014 as opposed to an index-based, or passive \u2014 investing bias are wrestling with their missions, contemplating mergers or exploring ways to use index-tracking exchange-traded funds to attract new investors, Dodge & Cox is staying true to its principles.At the root of those principles is a Vanguard-like aversion to spending money. Despite having $100 billion parked in stocks and bonds that trade in overseas markets, the company has no investment offices in Europe or Asia. In addition to doing no advertising, the firm has no public relations office and no sales force.A glance at employees\u2019 business cards highlights this self-effacing culture. Mr. Pohl and Dana M. Emery, the firm\u2019s chief executive, hand out cards free of any reference to title or position \u2014 an oddity in the status conscious world of finance.Executives at the firm insisted that there was a method to the madness: investors reaping better returns from lower fees on Dodge funds.For example: According to Morningstar, the 0.52 fee levied on the Dodge & Cox Stock fund is half the price of the average large stock fund, which charges about 1.07 percent to investors these days.\u201cThe fee differential is unique,\u201d said Andrew Daniels, an analyst at Morningstar who covers the firm\u2019s main fund, Dodge & Cox Stock. He added: \u201cTheir interests are aligned with fund holders, and, for how strong a fund this is, it\u2019s one of the cheapest active funds that you can buy.\u201dDodge & Cox is, in many ways, a throwback to a much earlier time, before mutual fund companies went public and before the now departed era when hot shot portfolio managers graced the covers of glossy magazines. Its first offering, the Balanced Fund, was established in 1931.Since then, generations of top managers have resisted the urge to sell their shares in an initial public offering. And while many firms brag about low manager turnover, few can match Dodge & Cox\u2019s numbers.Mr. Pohl, 59, has been chairman since 2013. He and Ms. Emery, who is in charge of fixed-income investing, preside over the firm\u2019s investment committee and also share operational responsibilities. He has spent 33 years at the firm; she has been there for 34.It is not uncommon for people to stay at Dodge & Cox for a long time. One of the firm\u2019s founders, E. Morris Cox, who died in 2003, came into the office regularly when he was well into his 90s. These days, the average firm tenure for all of its portfolio managers is 19 years. At the 25 largest fund families, the comparable figure is just over 8 years, according to Morningstar.Mr. Daniels cited two factors in particular that allowed the firm to keep its fees down.\u201cThey really eat their own cooking,\u201d Mr. Daniels said.Mr. Pohl, the Dodge & Cox chairman, said his company\u2019s methods enabled it to excel.\u201cWe are after a different customer,\u201d he said, \u201csomeone who does not have to read an ad or have a broker call them. And in return they get a lower fee and a better long-term return.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re watching the unlikely career resurrection of Klaus Kleinfeld, who will oversee a $500 billion economic development zone in Saudi Arabia. More on that in a moment.It took Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tiebreaking vote that struck down the ability of Americans to file class-action lawsuits against financial institutions. But Republicans had long opposed the move against arbitration clauses that had been proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it would have led to frivolous lawsuits and driven up credit card interest rates.In recent months, financial firms and their Republican allies in Congress mobilized to defeat the rule. Some credit unions and community banks also weighed in, lodging calls to lawmakers in their home states.What people are saying about the voteSome at the conference were floored that Mr. Kleinfeld had clearly landed on his feet with such large responsibility and oversight.

Facebook said the content on both pages had included someone else\u2019s personal identifiable information, which violates its terms of service.A Facebook spokeswoman didn\u2019t identify who had made the complaint about Mr. Guo.The big read Business leaders and conservative economists assert that a permanent cut in the corporate tax rate is the best way to spur investment and job growth. But the Republican proposal may not give them that reassurance.The ability to pay for the tax cuts matters because of Senate rules requiring legislation that adds to the federal deficit after a decade to expire. If Republicans can\u2019t show that a long-term tax cut will be deficit-neutral, they will have to scale back the size of the corporate tax cuts, make them temporary or find another way to pay for them.The prominent economic pessimist David Stockman, a director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration, said Wall Street was \u201cdelusional\u201d if it believed the plan would pass.\u201cThis is a fiscal disaster that when they [Wall Street] begin to look at it, they\u2019ll see it\u2019s not even remotely paid for.

{"Headline": "Why the Trade Deficit Matters, and What Trump Can Do About It", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ScenePresident Trump surely remembers when Japan was eating America\u2019s lunch.Three decades later, some protagonists have changed, but the plot remains the same. Hobbled by a two-decade slump, Japan is out of the picture. Mr. Trump\u2019s main nemeses are now Mexico and China, and he remains fixated on getting even.And yet the president\u2019s political success, 30 years after his diatribes against Japan, underscores just how much the trade deficit matters. A symbol of America\u2019s malaise, it helped propel his insurgent candidacy to the presidency by harnessing beleaguered workers\u2019 anger at the status quo.As C. Fred Bergsten, founder and director emeritus of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told me, \u201cEven if the deficit is financeable it is not sustainable in domestic political terms.\u201dThe trade deficit\u2019s political power raises a question that seems overdue: Why has an advanced nation like the United States allowed such large imbalances to persist for such a long time? Perhaps there is a case for policy makers in Washington to do something to narrow the gap.The American current account deficit \u2014 the broadest measure of the balance of trade in goods and services \u2014 is an anomaly.Economists\u2019 standard explanation of international trade says that rich countries like the United States will export capital, of which they have a lot, lending to poorer nations that have little capital but a lot of cheap labor. These poor countries, in turn, will invest the borrowed money in American-made machines for factories in which to employ their workers. So the lending will generate exports for the United States \u2014 building a trade surplus.Most developed nations adhere to this pattern most of the time. The European Union now has a current account surplus. If it weren\u2019t for the United States, so would the G7 group of major industrialized countries. But since 1980, the United States has found itself mostly on the borrowing end of the deal. It has used the foreign capital to finance investment at home, racking up huge trade deficits along the way.Some economists will argue that the trade deficit is ultimately irrelevant if there is sufficient money coming in from abroad to pay for it at a reasonable interest rate. So what if China owns a ton of Treasury bonds? Even fears that it might dump them to hurt the United States ignore that China has little incentive to do that. It would amass enormous losses, too.But it is a mistake to ignore the wounds caused by persistent trade imbalances on American workers.The trade deficit hasn\u2019t had a uniform effect across the economy. As it soared over the last half century, it was workers in industries that compete with imports \u2014 like manufacturing \u2014 who lost out. And employment shifted to industries that were not exposed to trade.The combination, Mr. Bergsten suggests, produced the protectionist backlash that delivered the presidency to Mr. Trump.The United States has run large trade deficits when its trading partners were manipulating the currency and when they weren\u2019t. It ran large trade deficits when President Ronald Reagan ran large budget deficits. It ran them again when the Clinton administration turned the budget deficit into a surplus \u2014 a change that should have increased national savings, economists argued at the time.Economists argue that the deficits will stop when Americans stop consuming and investing more than they earn, reducing the demand for money from overseas. But that is easier said than done.The one straightforward recommendation to address the trade deficit would be for Mr. Trump to do something he surely won\u2019t: drop the rest of his promised economic agenda, starting with his multitrillion-dollar tax cut, which would reduce national savings and make the trade deficit balloon.The dollar is the main currency used in global trade, as well as international capital market transactions. People and governments the world over store their wealth in American stocks and bonds. What\u2019s more, the dollar is the go-to currency in the time of financial crises, even if the crises at hand are centered in the United States. Against these forces it is hard to keep the dollar down.All Mr. Baker had to do was convince his counterparts that if they didn\u2019t play they might risk protectionist moves from Congress. And by 1989, the dollar had fallen 50 percent against the Japanese yen and more than 40 percent against the West German mark.This kind of approach seems like a perfect fit for Mr. Trump, who tends to enjoy making threats. If he did so, the trade deficit might even close. In 1991, the United States even ran a current account surplus for two full quarters.Advertisement"}

Her term ends early next year, and President Trump is deciding whether to reappoint her or pick someone else.And he may well. But there is a strong case that Trump would be serving his own political interests by reappointing Yellen, and if we know one thing about Trump, it\u2019s that he cares about his own interests.I would still be somewhat surprised if Trump reappointed Yellen. The chance to fire someone appointed by Barack Obama may prove too tempting. And Yellen is more forceful on financial-market regulation, the Fed\u2019s other main role, than most Trump administration officials.But I\u2019ve also become persuaded that for Trump\u2019s own sake, the savvy move would be reappointing Yellen. Almost nothing can hurt a president\u2019s popularity the way a weak economy can, as both George Bushes and Jimmy Carter painfully learned.For the same reason, three presidents with stronger economic performance on their watch \u2014 Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Obama \u2014 all chose to reappoint a Fed chairman who had originally been chosen by a previous president from the other political party.

{"Headline": "Focused Bets on Growth Propel Three Stock Funds", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe managers of three of the third quarter\u2019s better-performing mutual funds thrived by betting on growth: They all favored companies that have been increasing their earnings at faster-than-average rates.They are also willing to double their bets, holding far fewer stocks than the typical actively managed mutual fund.Managers sometimes load up on lots of stocks \u2014 the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar holds 164 \u2014 to diversify their holdings, preventing a few bad bets from sapping the overall return. Some research has shown, Ms. Starke said, that \u201cyou get rid of much of that risk by the time you hit 20 stocks.\u201d She said she tried to own what she called \u201ccore growth names,\u201d like Facebook and Amazon, and would then \u201cpepper in some interesting emerging companies.\u201d When managers hoard too many stocks, she said, their funds can end up performing like the overall market.In sleuthing out shares, Ms. Starke leans toward the information technology and health care sectors. \u201cThat\u2019s where you find the most innovation and differentiation,\u201d she said. Her largest holding at midyear was Alexion Pharmaceuticals, a maker of drugs for rare diseases.Alexion has been restructuring, with layoffs and a planned move of its headquarters from New Haven, Conn. to Boston. An internal investigation uncovered improper sales practices, but Ms. Starke said she viewed the company\u2019s troubles as transitory. \u201cThey have a growing drug pipeline,\u201d she said, \u201cand the bad news didn\u2019t affect the longer-term fundamentals.\u201dThe distinctive nature of biotechnology companies\u2019 product pipelines is a draw for Ms. Starke. \u201cThe companies are typically not competing against each other \u2014 they can all be addressing different diseases,\u201d she said. The health care sector, which includes biotechnology, recently accounted for about a third of her fund\u2019s assets \u2014 about twice as much as her average Morningstar peer.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 1.15 percent, returned 8.1 percent for the third quarter, compared with the 4.48 percent returned by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500.John H. Neff, one of the three portfolio managers, said that he and his two colleagues, Charles T. Akre Jr. and Thomas Saberhagen, liken their investment process to a three-legged stool. They seek businesses with strong competitive advantages, skilled and honest management and promising opportunities for reinvestment.\u201cOur job is to be as discriminating as we can in identifying these three-legged stool businesses and to be discriminating in what we pay for them,\u201d Mr. Neff said. If stocks do not meet those criteria, the fund will sometimes let cash build up. \u201cIf we\u2019re not seeing opportunities that meet that hurdle, it sits.\u201dA theme in the portfolio is what Mr. Neff called \u201cbottleneck\u201d or \u201ctoll-bridge\u201d businesses: outfits that operate at a choke point in the economy and profit from their position.Consider Mastercard, a top recent holding. The volume of electronic transactions, which Mastercard processes, continues to grow, but cash and checks still prevail worldwide, Mr. Neff said. That represents a hefty opportunity for handlers of electronic payments. \u201cWhatever you buy and wherever you buy it in the world, we own a business that has improving odds of being involved,\u201d he said.Mr. Neff said that another of the fund\u2019s top holdings, Moody\u2019s, the credit-rating agency, likewise stood athwart a toll bridge: Its ratings are critical in the issuance of bonds and other debt securities. The biggest raters \u2014 Standard & Poor\u2019s is the other \u2014 came under fire after the financial crisis because some of the subprime mortgage bonds they classified as investment-worthy ended up collapsing, and some policy makers have called for greater competition in the industry. So far, though, Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s continue to dominate, and Mr. Neff said that he and his colleagues do not foresee that changing soon.The Akre fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 1.34 percent, returned 9.99 percent in the third quarter.Mr. DuFour has latelyheard that bang coming fromtechnology stocks, which accounted for 40 percent of the fund at September\u2019s end. In picking stocks, he said, he does not heed sector classifications. \u201cI\u2019m sector agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cMy overweights change based on where I find good investments, and I see great stuff in tech now.\u201dHe added he did not see his technology investments as bets solely on computers and the web. PayPal, for example, was a top recent holding, and the company is an innovator in the technology for handling online payments. \u201cBut they also do loans and credit cards,\u201d he said.The growth in electronic payments is one of the three themes that unify the fund, he said. The others are the internet, especially the emergence of artificial intelligence, and exchanged-traded funds.Mr. DuFour said that working for Fidelity, one of the country\u2019s largest asset managers, had given him insight into the upsurge in E.T.F. investment. Fidelity, like its industry counterparts, has had money flow out of its actively managed funds and into its passively managed ones, including E.T.F.s, he said. (An E.T.F., like a traditional index mutual fund, often tracks an index.)\u201cAs I look for ways to play that, it turns out that people who own the indexes are in a very advantageous position,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, in my top 10, one of the names that shows up is Standard & Poor\u2019s,\u201d which is also a leading creator of indexes. Every E.T.F. built around, say, the S.&P. 500 must pay Standard & Poor\u2019s for theright to use the index.Mr. DuFour\u2019s fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 0.62 percent, returned 7.75 percent in the third quarter. Mr. DuFour has managed the fund since 2007. Over that time, it has returned an annualized average of 8.41 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Chair Should Be a \u2018Principled Populist\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsStephanie Kelton, a former chief economist for the Senate Budget Committee Democratic staff and a professor of public policy and economics at Stony Brook University, met with Paul McCulley, a senior fellow and professor at Cornell University Law School and former chief economist at Pacific Investment Management Company, to discuss the Federal Reserve and who should be its chair, the 2 percent inflation target, President Trump and the debate over tax cuts, and what a \u201cpopulist\u201d Fed might look like.First, do you think it would be a mistake not to reappoint Yellen?And she openly worries about our nation\u2019s ever-larger wealth and income inequality. She wants workers to have not only a job, but rising real wages.To date, the wage response has been notedly punk. So she hasn\u2019t gotten wrapped around the inflation-risk axle about the unemployment rate falling below where many think it can prudently go. I\u2019m a huge fan of Janet Yellen.To me, full employment will be when labor has pricing power relative to capital \u2014 meaning asking the boss for a raise and getting it \u2014 such that corporate profit margins shrink relative to labor\u2019s share of national income. Yes, I know that sounds radical.The Fed, as an institution, has pushed back against the idea that its 2 percent inflation target should be raised, on the notion that the transition to a higher target would be fraught with too much risk. I fully acknowledge that doing so would heighten uncertainty and thus volatility \u2014 triggering upward pressure on long-term interest rates relative to the Fed\u2019s short-term policy rate, as well as downward pressure on price-to-earnings multiples for stocks \u2014 but I do not see that as a compelling reason not to lift it.The Fed\u2019s operational independence is grounded in the thesis that the legislature cannot be trusted with monetary policy, as the electoral process is inherently biased to inflation, of overstimulating the economy with too much spending relative to taxation, running inflationary budget deficits.That simply has not been the case for a long, long time. Yes, we\u2019ve had large deficits, but inflation has been too low, not too high. Thus, I\u2019m not convinced by the argument that strict Fed independence is always and everywhere needed to discipline the fiscal authorities\u2019 inflationary bias.My point is that there is no reason for the Fed to prevent the \u201cexperiment,\u201d if Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress want to run it.President Trump is proposing enormous tax cuts that would add significantly to the deficit. His budget director, Mick Mulvaney, says \u201cwe need new deficits\u201d in order to get the 3 to 4 percent growth the White House is looking for. What do you think? Do we need deficits, and would Trump\u2019s tax cuts give us the right kind of deficits to spur growth?But I vehemently disagree with the idea that cutting taxes for the rich is the best way to go about increasing the budget deficit to boost growth. Increased public investment and tax cuts for budget-constrained families would have a far higher bang-for-the-deficit-dollar effect on growth. And even more important to me, personally, such an approach would be pass a smell test of social justice.Banks are many things, but at their core, they have a public utility function, access to the payments system \u2014 the highway, if you will, on which you get paid and pay your bills.In that sense, banks are not different than the gas company or the electric company, connecting you to the grid \u2014 a natural oligopoly. Accordingly, I take offense with the notion that banks should have the right to put cram-down arbitration clauses into every citizen\u2019s \u201chook up\u201d to the payment system.You really don\u2019t have a choice but to do business with a financial institution connected to the grid. In fact, unless you pay in person at a local I.R.S. office, you actually must have access to pay your taxes.There is nothing voluntary about needing access to the payments grid, any more than there is anything voluntary about needing access to core household utilities. Social justice \u2014 a theme to which I return again and again \u2014 demands that citizens have access to the court system for redress in the purchases of services where they have no choice but to buy.A fiery run on the shadow bank Lehman Brothers triggered the financial crisis. Our government had no choice but to rescue, then transform, Lehman\u2019s too-big-to-fail shadow bank brethren into conventional banks, with access to the government\u2019s safety nets.But that access came with the quid pro quo of the same regulatory restrictions as conventional banks, reducing the fun and profitability of their shadow banking game.Dodd-Frank imposed additional restraints on playing with maturity-transformation nitro. But bankers, of all stripes, still just want to have fun. They would now like not only a relaxation of the Dodd Frank quid pro quo, but also to be rid of the term \u201cshadow banking.\u201dBad Karma, you know. And they now have both a Congress and a Treasury friendly to their interests.I don\u2019t worry about efforts to take the term shadow banking out of the lexicon. I actually use the term \u201cmarket-based finance\u201d myself frequently. I do worry, however, about what the erase-it effort represents: a cyclical turn to regulators once again being enthralled and captured by the regulated.Stephanie Kelton, a former chief economist for the Senate Budget Committee Democratic staff, is a professor of public policy and economics at Stony Brook University.

{"Headline": "An Explanation of Initial Coin Offerings", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInitial coin offerings have come out of nowhere in 2017 to become the talk of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Programmers have raised over $3.2 billion this year by selling their own virtual currencies to investors. That is 3,000 percent more than the amount raised using coin offerings in 2016.Coin offerings are a way for start-ups or online projects to raise money without selling stock or going to venture capitalists \u2014 essentially a new form of crowdfunding.The programmers raise money by creating and selling their own virtual currency, generally with rules similar to well-known virtual currencies like Bitcoin. The new tokens are usually designed so that they can be used only on a computing service the programmers are building.Filecoin, which raised $257 million in the largest coin offering to date, is being designed to pay for storage on a global cloud storage network that the creators of Filecoin are promising to build. BET, another coin, is being designed to serve as the chips in an online casino its programmers are promising to build.\u201cPromising to build\u201d is the operative phrase here, because in almost every case the services that will supposedly make these coins valuable have not yet been finished.These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist \u2014 to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity \u2014 and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem.Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network). What\u2019s more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology.But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value.The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors. But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors don\u2019t get an ownership stake in the start-ups. If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law. A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it.Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used. So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed.In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up. When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny. In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase.After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding \u2014 similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O. The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up.The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future.The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists. The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded. The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesn\u2019t even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million.Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings don\u2019t have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors.Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital won\u2019t fund. Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum. Filecoin\u2019s cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company.It is easier than it seems. The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics. There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept. Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything.Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.China and South Korea have said it is illegal.In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds. If a coin is categorized as a security, it has to follow all relevant securities law, such as registering with the authorities and ensuring that people buying the coins are properly accredited and vetted. Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules.Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down. Some are expecting that the first targets will be the exchanges where the coins are traded.Investors don\u2019t have much recourse. The most likely outcome will be that the investors will lose the money they put into the project, though people may try to sue.A number of prominent Silicon Valley investors have argued that coin offerings could provide a way to build open-source projects that would not have otherwise received support.Some big names think this will lead to a new generation of open-source internet protocols and loosen the control of big companies like Google and Facebook.But even sophisticated enthusiasts believe that almost all of the companies currently raising money through coin offerings will fail and lose money for their investors \u2014 and probably should not happen in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sad Tale of the MyRA", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe rising stock market has recently become one of President Trump\u2019s favorite tropes. \u201cStock market has increased by 5.2 trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25 percent increase,\u201d he tweeted on Oct. 16. Yet, for most Americans, the larger issue is that this upturn is seldom felt.An equity inequity has driven America\u2019s wealth gap to historic levels. Eighty percent of Americans own only 8 percent of the nation\u2019s stocks. One-third of Americans have saved nothing for their retirement. The scale of the challenge calls for ambitious initiatives to put asset-building power and retirement security into the hands of all Americans. Instead, Republicans and Democrats have played to type, even when all evidence points to the failure of both the traditional left and the traditional right solutions.If anyone wonders why Americans have lost faith in government, the sad saga of the myRA program tells the tale.The myRA sounded like a good idea. Qualifying workers could put up to $5,500 a year into the account \u2014 or $6,500 if they were over 50 years old \u2014 which would be invested in government bonds, guaranteeing a modest but dependable return.Yet, despite the good motives, myRA was a tiny tinker when large-scale change is demanded, a government-run program instead of a market-based response, and a dramatic waste of taxpayer dollars. Because it was managed by the Treasury Department and only invested in government securities, the private sector was kept off the playing field. As opposed to individual retirement accounts, there was no flood of financial industry TV commercials trying to persuade Americans to open a myRA.Running the entire program through the federal government, the Obama administration spent $70 million and only got 20,000 Americans to invest \u2014 an outrageous cost of $3,500 for each new account. Of that, $10 million went to a single bank \u2014 Comerica \u2014 to act as custodian for this small number of simple, non-trading accounts.Inheriting this debacle, the Trump administration could have reformed this program. Or it could have replaced it. Instead, it repealed it without anything to take its place. The cabinet is stacked with millionaires while Americans sitting on the sidelines of asset building are being told they are on their own.When it comes to the crisis of retirement security and asset building, the financial industry has been either callous in a focus on serving only the very wealthy or rapacious as it saddles everyday investors with high fees. The federal government has oscillated between incompetence and indifference; between being softheaded or hardhearted. And the plight of the hundreds of millions of Americans continues as they watch inequality grow and their financial security wither.It was not always this way. Just 10 years ago, a bipartisan collection of senators \u2014 Jeff Sessions, Jim DeMint and Rick Santorum on one side of the aisle and Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer on the other \u2014 came together to support legislation to give newborn Americans a $500 \u201cbaby bond\u201d that would grow over time. Amid the tumult of the Great Recession, this idea of a \u201cnest egg in every crib\u201d went the way of the Republicans\u2019 promise in 1928 to put \u201ca chicken in every pot\u201d during the Great Depression.Perhaps in a Washington struggling to find a way to make tax reform bold and bipartisan, this idea may yet have new lease on life. Whether it is policy or private sector innovation, an alternative to the status quo in Washington and on Wall Street is the only way to bridge the growing gap between a surging investing class and vast majority of Americans falling ever further behind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Grow Stronger, China Has to Grow More Slowly", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen President Xi Jinping of China took power in 2012, digital cash hardly existed. Last year, the Chinese made $9 trillion in mobile payments, 80 times more than Americans. Chinese consumers pay for 25 percent of their purchases with digital cash delivered by a mobile phone app, and about one in seven carry no paper currency. In big cities like Shanghai, it\u2019s hard to use paper to pay taxi fares or restaurant bills.The rapid rise of a cashless society is a vivid example of how China broke out as a tech superpower in Mr. Xi\u2019s first term. Left largely unregulated and free to innovate \u2014 on condition that they cooperate with government censors \u2014 the New China\u2019s private-sector tech giants have made stunning advances.Now that the 2017 Communist Party Congress has confirmed Mr. Xi\u2019s complete hold on power for five more years, the question is how will he use this clout in pursuit of China\u2019s ultimate goal: to catch up with the United States as the world\u2019s leading economic superpower.The answer depends on whether Mr. Xi recognizes that to continue growing stronger, China will have to grow more slowly. In its rush to catch the United States, China has been prioritizing growth that is wildly ambitious for a maturing, middle-income country. To hit its growth target, Beijing has been pumping record amounts of debt into the state-owned industries of Old China. Those debts now represent the biggest threat to the New China and Mr. Xi\u2019s superpower ambitions.The state-run economy of Old China still accounts for a sizable share of economic output, roughly 30 percent. Since 2008 more and more of the loans intended to prop up Old China have been going to risky investments like stocks and real estate and wasteful public construction projects. While it took one dollar of debt to fuel a dollar of growth before 2008, lately it has taken four dollars of debt.Much has been said about all the money the United States, Europe and Japan have printed to stimulate the post-crisis recovery, but China has printed more than twice as much as those three combined, expanding its money supply by $16 trillion. A lot of this money has been diverted from industry into stock and real estate bubbles, rattling Chinese investors. By 2015 Chinese investors were sending billions of dollars\u2019 worth of renminbi abroad every month. To prevent a capital flight crisis, Beijing had to slap on new controls.There is now a great pool of money trapped in China, itching to escape. Foreigners don\u2019t have faith in a currency they can\u2019t move freely, any more than locals do, and today the renminbi accounts for less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves, compared with over 60 percent for the United States dollar. Beijing had hoped to establish the renminbi as a reserve currency and make China a financial superpower, but it has made no progress.To create trust in its currency and financial system, China has to quit pumping out debt to hit its unrealistic annual growth target of 6.5 percent. That target reflects the pace required to meet a goal set at the 2012 Party Congress, which was to double the size of the economy by 2020. Every time growth slips below 6.5 percent, the authorities roll out more debt, fearful that slower growth will undermine their geopolitical goals. Continuing on this path, China may double G.D.P. by 2020, but debt (excluding the financial sector) will rise from a precarious 235 percent of G.D.P. today to a potentially destabilizing 280 percent.The most important step Mr. Xi could take is to scrap the habit of setting growth targets. To stabilize debt at the current level, China would need to accept growth of no more than 5 percent \u2014 about the pace of previous \u201cmiracle\u201d economies like Japan and South Korea at a similar stage of development. To aim higher is to push China toward a debt crisis that could derail growth for years.China has been able to keep the debt flowing longer than many people expected because in many cases the state owns both lender and borrower, and can keep shifting the debt from one hand to the other, like a three-card-monte player. Optimists think Beijing can play this game indefinitely, because the debt is domestically held, but eventually the banks will run short of money, in the form of deposits.For the first time in China\u2019s modern history, total loans in the banking system now exceed deposits and are growing at a rate that will probably push loans to above 120 percent of deposits by 2020. At that point in a debt binge, history shows, a financial crisis of some kind usually breaks out, even in countries like China, where the debt is funded internally and not by foreigners.Any crisis in Old China is likely to spill over into the vibrant private sectors, which are relatively debt-free. The private sector now accounts for 70 percent of economic output but only 30 percent of corporate debt. The only way to prevent a ripple-effect crisis in the New China is to slow the flow of debt, which means dropping growth targets grounded in political ambition rather than economic logic.Mr. Xi seems to understand the perils of debt, which has undermined many past empires, including dynasties in China. He recently questioned the official obsession with G.D.P. growth \u2014 saying development is \u201cnot a numbers game\u201d and that most Chinese care more about quality-of-life issues like pollution. Significantly, in his speech last week at the Party Congress, Mr. Xi did not refer to the 2020 growth target, implying flexibility on the need to achieve it.But until Mr. Xi outright scraps the growth target, all the players in the Old China are going to put a priority on hitting it, no matter how much debt it takes. Fitful government attempts to tighten credit regulations have merely shifted the flow of debt to new targets, most recently mortgage loans. The International Monetary Fund argues that China is much more likely to \u201cbecome a rich country in the long run\u201d if it puts more emphasis on slower debt growth and less on hitting high growth targets.If China\u2019s economy is allowed to slow further \u2014 as previous miracle economies did at a similar stage of development \u2014 it will take longer for the economy to match the size of the United States economy, certainly much longer than China\u2019s leaders had hoped. Better, though, to be remembered for putting China on the long path to real superpower status than the shorter path to crisis.Ruchir Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s $700 Billion Gift to Wealthy Foreigners", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy is Donald Trump planning to give away $700 billion \u2014 that\u2019s billion, with a \u201cb\u201d \u2014 to foreigners, no strings attached? You probably didn\u2019t know that he\u2019s planning to do this. In fact, he himself almost surely has no idea that he\u2019s planning to do this. But it would be one clearly predictable consequence of the tax \u201creform\u201d he and his congressional allies are trying to pass.For what it\u2019s worth, the argument goes like this: Cutting corporate taxes would bring foreign capital into the United States, which would raise investment, which would increase productivity, and this productivity would then get reflected in higher wages. If this sounds like a convoluted and uncertain story, with many weak links in the supposed chain of events that ends up helping workers so much, that\u2019s because it is.There are, in reality, multiple reasons not to believe much of this account, ranging from the fact that a lot of the corporate income we tax represents monopoly profits \u2014 which won\u2019t be competed away even if foreign money comes flooding in \u2014 to the sheer size of the U.S. economy, which can\u2019t pull in lots of foreign capital without driving up interest rates worldwide.Realistically, then, the benefits from cutting corporate taxes would overwhelmingly flow into after-tax profits rather than wages, especially in the first few years and probably for a decade or more. And this in turn means that the main beneficiaries would be stockholders, not workers.But that\u2019s not the whole story, either \u2014 it gets worse.The whole sales pitch for the Trump tax plan rests on the claim that everything is different because we\u2019re now part of a global financial market. The truth is that this makes less difference than many imagine.What this means is that around 35 percent of a tax cut from an administration that proudly uses the slogan \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2014 $700 billion over the next decade \u2014 wouldn\u2019t even go to Americans. Instead, it would be a windfall to wealthy foreigners, who would probably gain a lot more from the tax cut than U.S. workers. Oh, and it makes all that talk about allies not paying their \u201cfair share\u201d sound kind of silly, doesn\u2019t it?Now, it may sound extreme to say that Trump and his allies want to take away health care from millions largely so that they can give wealthy foreigners a $700 billion gift.

{"Headline": "The Benefits (and the Catch) of Health Savings Accounts", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserIt\u2019s benefits open enrollment season at many employers, and workers are increasingly likely to hear about an option, known as an H.S.A., that can help them pay for medical expenses and save money on their taxes.H.S.A.s, or health savings accounts, are not yet as familiar as their better-known cousin, the F.S.A., flexible spending account. But H.S.A.s are becoming more common, according to the latest data.H.S.A.s offer a triple tax benefit. Contributions can be deducted pretax from your paycheck, lowering your taxable income; any interest or investment gains on the money is tax free; and withdrawals from the account are tax free, as long you spend the money on eligible items.And if you change jobs, the H.S.A. moves with you.But there\u2019s a catch: The savings accounts are available only with certain health insurance plans meeting specific criteria, like high deductibles \u2014 at least $1,300 for an individual and $2,600 for a family. (A deductible is the amount you pay for care before your health plan pays.)High-deductible health plans typically have cheaper monthly premiums \u2014 but you\u2019ll pay more out of pocket for care. The H.S.A. is meant to help cover those costs.You can set aside as much as $3,400 for an individual, or $6,750 for a family, in an H.S.A. You can leave the money in a basic, interest-bearing savings account or, in some cases, invest the money \u2014 just as you would with a 401(k) retirement account \u2014 for the long term.Ryan McCostlin, an expert in individual and family health care at the advisory firm Bernard Health, said the tax-free growth available with H.S.A.s made them powerful savings tools. \u201cConsumers should put that money in the market and let it grow slowly over time,\u201d Mr. McCostlin said in an email.Fidelity, which offers H.S.A.s, said money invested in a health savings account could help provide cash to cover needed health and medical costs in retirement. It estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring this year will need $275,000 to cover health and medical costs throughout retirement. (The cost estimate assumes enrollment in Medicare coverage but does not include extra costs like a nursing home or long-term care.)Many H.S.A.s, however, require that you have a minimum amount saved \u2014 say, $1,000 \u2014 before you can invest. The idea is that you should have some money set aside before you take investment risks.\u201cIf you will need the funds in the near future to pay medical bills, it may not make sense to invest,\u201d said Roy Ramthun, an H.S.A. consultant.But some account providers let you invest at any time. The health finance start-up Lively, for instance, allows H.S.A. participants to invest with no minimum balance. Lively offers a basic H.S.A. free, or charges users a flat $2.50 a month to invest in low-cost mutual funds and exchange-traded funds through the online brokerage firm TD Ameritrade.(Basketball fans may be interested to know that one of Lively\u2019s financial backers is the N.B.A. star Kevin Durant, who said in a prepared statement that he was \u201cdrawn to tech that helps people in real ways.\u201d)Here are some questions and answers about health savings accounts:Do I have to spend the money in my H.S.A. by a certain date?No. There\u2019s no deadline for spending the money in an H.S.A.; the balance simply rolls over year to year. (The Employee Benefit Research Institute said more than 90 percent of H.S.A.s ended 2016 with funds to roll over for future expenses).What can I buy using my H.S.A.?Can I have an H.S.A. if I\u2019m self-employed?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan Stocks Hit 21-Year High as Investors Shrug Off Concerns", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors appear to be looking at the bright side.But Japan has some of its own good news to share.On Wednesday, the government said corporate machinery orders, a closely watched indicator of business spending, had risen for the second month in a row in August, gaining 3.4 percent.It will be some time before Japan can hope to set all-time records. Stocks remain well below the levels they achieved at the height of Japan\u2019s late-1980s asset bubble. The bursting of that bubble left the country with a glut of production capacity for years, a result of dwindling consumption and overinvestment during the boom years.That imbalance is beginning to be rectified. Growing global demand for Japan\u2019s goods, a tightening labor market and a number of other factors have taken up some of that slack. The business cycle also has been favorable: Companies are beginning to spend more to maintain aging factories and equipment, said Mitsumaru Kumagai, chief economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research.That improvement is still nascent, Mr. Kumagai and others warn. Japan\u2019s growth spurt has been modest, and the wage and price gains are in their early days. Japan still has overcapacity to deal with.\u201cFor capital spending to take off in earnest will require companies to use up even more of their factory capacity,\u201d Mr. Kumagai said.The Nikkei 225 stock index on Wednesday edged up 58 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 20,881, its highest level since December 1996.Japan\u2019s recent stock moves have also been helped by the political scene in the country.Japan is set to hold parliamentary elections on Oct. 22, and analysts project that the governing Liberal Democratic Party will retain its hold on power.After a start that generated a flood of news coverage, Ms. Koike\u2019s new venture has stumbled.

{"Headline": "Should You Invest Your I.R.A. in Friends, Family or Charitable Work?", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringAbout five years ago, a good friend of William C. Brown, a tax lawyer in Des Moines, lost his job. The friend\u2019s wife ran a child-care center in a building she owned \u2014 but because of their financial difficulties, the couple fell behind on their mortgage payments.Their bank threatened to foreclose.Despondent, the couple went to Mr. Brown for assistance. Mr. Brown, who is now 63, decided that the best way to help them would be to buy the child-care center and then rent the property to them on a long-term lease, with an option for them to buy it back. So he did.\u201cWe\u2019re hearing that our clients are excited to be making a difference in a local community in a way that they didn\u2019t know was possible,\u201d said Matt Wilson, the chief executive officer of Equity Trust Company, a custodian of self-directed I.R.A.s in Westlake, Ohio.One Equity Trust client used his I.R.A. funds to issue a promissory note, so his friend could acquire a property to start a group home for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress. Another provided capital for small businesses seeking to expand. A third helped medical offices purchase X-ray and imaging equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s also inspiring other people to find a mission to diversify or expand their retirement portfolio but also giving back,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.\u201cMost people know that they can make charitable contributions via their distribution,\u201d said Curtis Glovier, chairman and chief executive of Pensco Trust Company, an alternative asset custodian in San Francisco that specializes in self-directed I.R.A.s. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get the word out that you don\u2019t need to just invest in plain vanilla mutual funds.\u201dHoward Teich, a psychologist in private practice in San Francisco, got the memo. Eighteen months ago, Dr. Teich, 76, invested his self-directed I.R.A. in Geostellar, which markets solar systems online. \u201cIt\u2019s the future,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be able to invest in something healthy that you\u2019re passionate about, like alternative energies \u2014 it doesn\u2019t get any better. I\u2019m taking a risk like any entrepreneur, but this is one way to take some action.\u201dA large part of the attraction to a self-directed I.R.A. is that the investor is in control. This is also the challenge.Clearly, this kind of investing is not for everyone. No investment is a sure thing, but investing precious retirement money in neighborhood businesses, or a pal\u2019s peanut farms, comes with risks far beyond the usual volatility in the stock market. You could lose it all \u2014 and lose a friend in the process.\u201cEvery investment has different risks,\u201d said Kirk Chisholm, a wealth manager in Lexington, Mass. \u201cThe obvious risk is making a bad investment,\u201d he said. After all, that\u2019s the whole point of investing for retirement \u2014 to build a nest egg. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing it just to help someone out, that\u2019s not a good investment. You want to make sure it makes your retirement money grow, or why invest at all?\u201dHe also suggests people invest in areas in which they have some expertise rather than operating blindly, even if they have the desire to do something good for another person or the community.\u201cYou can be well intentioned and still be misguided,\u201d said Nevin Adams, chief content officer at the American Retirement Association, a nonprofit member organization in Arlington, Va. \u201cBut the reality is, this is your I.R.A.; the reason it has protections is because it\u2019s something you are investing for retirement. It might be a good cause, but it might not be good for your retirement.\u201dMr. Brown \u2014 the man who invested in his friend\u2019s child-care building \u2014 has a big advantage in this dangerous game: Because he is a tax lawyer by profession he is well aware of the potential risks and how to avoid them.In his case, he structured a lease and option to buy back that would provide him with a fixed 10 percent annual return, regardless of how long he owned the real estate and when his friends exercised the option. He is aware that commercial real estate investors normally expect a greater return (rent plus appreciation), he said. But \u201cI didn\u2019t feel right doing it in the manner most real estate investors would do it, in light of my relationship with this friend.\u201d\u201cThe option was structured at a price equal to my purchase price, with a portion of their rent payments being credited against the purchase price if and when they exercised the option,\u201d he said. That structure gave his friends an incentive to exercise the option as soon as they could, while still giving Mr. Brown the 10 percent annual return he was seeking.\u201cIt also worked so that I did not feel I was gouging them, while still protecting my retirement-plan assets,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hearing Amazon\u2019s Footsteps, the Health Care Industry Shudders", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 With little more than a whiff of Amazon\u2019s interest in a new business, the company can crater the stocks of potential competitors, prompting them to consider bold acquisitions and other drastic measures in response. Just ask companies in the home improvement, meal-kit and grocery businesses.The likelihood of Amazon\u2019s eventually getting into the pharmacy business is high, several analysts and a former employee said. But it is not clear when it will make that move or how aggressive it intends to be.Brian Tanquilut, an analyst for Jefferies, noted that the company acquired many of the wholesale pharmacy licenses between fall of last year and early this year, around when the company started selling medical supplies to businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not evidence of a retail entry into the pharmacy business,\u201d he said.An Amazon spokeswoman, Lori Torgerson, refused to comment on \u201crumors or speculation\u201d about Amazon entering the pharmacy business, but she shared a statement that suggested other motivations for the paperwork. \u201cWholesale licenses are required for Amazon Business to sell professional-use only medical devices in certain states,\u201d she said.There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business. Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions.\u201cThe pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole,\u201d he said.While Mr. Ladd said he isn\u2019t privy to the company\u2019s current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried. \u201cMy advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care,\u201d he said.If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said.The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront. To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state \u2014 a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cThey can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business,\u201d said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners.She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business.The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers. Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason. Amazon\u2019s recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies.\u201cA large part of the infrastructure is already there,\u201d said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo.In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers. \u201cWe certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator,\u201d he said.If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers.This would be far more complex. It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one. Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use. The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon.Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way. The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs.Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications.No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is \u201cclearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way.\u201dBut while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right. \u201cIt is just a sensitive topic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes.\u201dFollow Nick Wingfield on Twitter @nickwingfieldAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gunman\u2019s Girlfriend Arrives in U.S. and Is Expected to Be Questioned", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive BriefingLAS VEGAS \u2014 Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of the gunman in the Las Vegas mass shooting, arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday night and was met by the authorities, according to a law enforcement official. She was expected to be questioned upon her arrival, a federal official said.Twelve rifles the gunman had in his hotel suite on Sunday were outfitted with a \u201cbump stock,\u201d a device that would enable them to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said at a news conference late Tuesday.\u2022 The police received the first call about shots being fired at 10:08 p.m. Sunday and Mr. Paddock stopped shooting at 10:19 p.m., around the time security guards approached his 32nd-floor luxury suite in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.\u2022 Mr. Paddock had placed one camera inside his hotel room, over the peephole facing the hallway, and two outside his room, including one on a service cart. \u201cI anticipate he was looking for anybody coming to take him into custody,\u201d Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said.\u2022 Jill A. Snyder, a special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said that 47 firearms \u2014 rifles, shotguns and pistols \u2014 had been recovered from the hotel suite and at two Nevada properties Mr. Paddock owned. The weapons were purchased in California, Nevada, Texas and Utah, Ms. Snyder said.\u2022 Undersheriff Kevin McMahill confirmed the authenticity of leaked photographs of the deceased gunman, with a revolver by his side, and of his hotel suite, showing ammunition and rifles. An internal investigation has been opened into the release of the photos, he said.\u2022 Investigators also were looking into whether Mr. Paddock had planned an earlier attack in Las Vegas before deciding to target the concert on Sunday night, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Mr. Paddock had multiple semiautomatic rifles, weapons that fire a single round with each pull of the trigger. A fully automatic weapon, like a machine gun, will quickly fire round after round with a single pull of the finger, until the user releases the trigger or empties the magazine.Fully automatic weapons, tightly regulated by federal law since the 1930s, are much rarer than semiautomatic ones. Military versions of assault rifles often have a setting for fully automatic fire, but the versions made for the civilian market do not.The rapid fire heard on recordings of the Las Vegas shooting suggested a fully automatic weapon, and police officers called it that on radio traffic. But replacing a standard rifle stock, the part that rests against the shoulder, with a bump stock allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire at a rate comparable to a fully automatic rifle \u2014 much faster than a human user can pull and release the trigger.Bump stocks are legal and inexpensive, with some versions advertised for $99.A standard stock is firmly fixed to the rifle. But a bump stock allows the body of the rifle to slide a short distance back and forth, harnessing the recoil energy of each shot. The shooter does not move the trigger finger; instead, the weapon bounces, or \u201cbumps,\u201d rapidly between shoulder and finger.In 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California proposed outlawing bump stocks, but Congress has not acted on her proposal. She proposed a ban again on Tuesday.Las Vegas police officers took cover and directed concertgoers to safety as gunshots rang out on Sunday, newly released body camera footage shows.\u201cHey, you guys, get down,\u201d one officer shouted at bystanders between volleys of gunfire. \u201cGo that way. Get out of here. There are gunshots coming from over there. Go that way.\u201dAmid confusion about where the blasts were coming from, some people rebuffed requests to evacuate. \u201cThat\u2019s fireworks,\u201d one bystander shouted at officers. Another yelled expletives when told to take cover.As sirens blared and gunfire crackled, the video showed officers straining to find the source of the shots.\u201cHey, they\u2019re shooting right at us, guys,\u201d one officer said as he and his colleagues crouched behind a wall with their weapons drawn. \u201cEverybody stay down, stay down.\u201d\u201cNorth of the Mandalay Bay, it\u2019s coming out of a window,\u201d another officer then says.The three-minute video released by the police on Tuesday was a compilation of footage from the cameras of several officers at the scene.\u201cThere\u2019s multiple people shot up there,\u201d someone says in one clip.\u201cWe see muzzle blasts from the Mandalay Bay,\u201d someone, apparently an officer, said in another clip.President Trump on Tuesday called Mr. Paddock \u201ca sick man, a demented man,\u201d adding that \u201cwe are dealing with a very, very sick individual.\u201dHe also said that there would be some sort of discussion about gun legislation, but was not specific.\u201cWe will be talking about gun laws as time goes by,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he prepared to leave Washington for hurricane-battered Puerto Rico.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, rebuffed questions about potential legislative action during his regular news conference on Tuesday afternoon, saying that the massacre was being politicized.\u201cLook, the investigation\u2019s not even been completed,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any.\u201dThe president is scheduled to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday.The police continued to block some traffic along the southern end of the strip on Tuesday evening as they combed over the concert site, which was littered with lawn chairs, backpacks and other personal belongings fans left behind as they fled.The venue was effectively frozen in time, with the stage still intact just the way it had been when the shooting began, and signs beckoning \u201cCome on in!\u201d at the entrance. A handful of flowers and red heart balloons had been placed on the median.Most of the people killed in the shooting died on the concert grounds, the police said.Although many witnesses gathered in the intersection of Reno Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard on Monday, by Tuesday they had been replaced with dozens of television cameras from all over the world.How one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history unfolded.At least 23 firearms, including a handgun, were found in Mr. Paddock\u2019s hotel suite, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Police Department said Mr. Paddock used multiple rifles during the attack.A federal law enforcement official earlier said two rifles were outfitted with scopes and set up on tripods in front of two big windows. Another official said that among the weapons were AR-15-style assault rifles. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to divulge details of the investigation.Sheriff Lombardo said that Mr. Paddock brought at least 10 suitcases into his hotel room over a period of time.The sheriff said that Mr. Paddock fired through his hotel room door at security guards, striking one in the leg. The guard is still alive, he said. SWAT officers went in after the guard was shot.In addition to the weapons at the hotel, the sheriff said the police retrieved 19 firearms, as well as explosives, several thousand rounds of ammunition and \u201celectronic devices\u201d from Mr. Paddock\u2019s home in Mesquite, Nev.The investigation into Mr. Paddock\u2019s gun arsenal led investigators to New Frontier Armory, a large North Las Vegas dealer, distributor and manufacturer of firearms.David M. Famiglietti, the company\u2019s president, issued a statement on Tuesday confirming that Mr. Paddock purchased \u201cseveral\u201d rifles and shotguns from the business last spring \u2014 all at the same time. It\u2019s not uncommon for customers to do this to save money on background check fees, Mr. Famiglietti said.\u201cThe firearms he purchased did not leave our store capable of what we\u2019ve seen and heard in the video without modification,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not fully automatic firearms, nor were they modified in any way \u2014 legally or illegally \u2014 when they were purchased from us.\u201dMr. Famiglietti said that nothing about Mr. Paddock raised red flags with the store\u2019s sales clerk. On the contrary, according to Mr. Famiglietti, Mr. Paddock seemed to be interested in competitive shooting, asking the clerk a lot of questions about three-gun shooting matches \u2014 an increasingly popular sport in which players use a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol.\u201cHe just seemed like a normal guy,\u201d said Mr. Famiglietti, whose store has been the target of hate mail, threatening phone calls and fake reviews since the shooting. \u201cWe obviously did not sell him these firearms with the intent that he would use them to hurt anyone in any way.\u201dOn Monday, a Mesquite, Nev., gun dealer, Guns & Guitars, acknowledged having sold two rifles and a handgun to Mr. Paddock. Like the purchases at Frontier, those were cleared by state and federal background checks.Investigators are trying to piece together his financial history to search for clues that could help determine what set him off.Mr. Paddock often bet heavily at the major casino hotels, and his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, 62, who was out of the country at the time of the shooting, had worked for some of those hotels. They lived in Mesquite, Nev., 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, and he also owned a home in Reno.Ms. Danley boarded a flight from Manila to Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to Antonette Mangrobang, a spokeswoman for the Philippine Immigration Bureau. The authorities, who met Ms. Danley at the Los Angeles airport, have called her a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the shooting investigation, which does not necessarily mean that she is suspected of committing a crime.The police estimated that when the shooting began, there were 22,000 people at the Harvest Festival, listening to Jason Aldean, the final act of the three-day event.Video of the shooting captured nine seconds of continuous, rapid fire, followed by 37 seconds of silence from the weapon and panicked screaming from the crowd. Gunfire then erupted again and again in extended bursts. Some concertgoers thought the noise was fireworks, but as it became clear what was happening, people fled, many of them unsure where the shots were coming from, or where they should go.\u201cEveryone was running, you could see people getting shot,\u201d said Gail Davis, one of the witnesses. \u201cI\u2019ve never been that scared in my life,\u201d she added. \u201cTo have this happen, I can\u2019t wrap my mind around it.\u201dWithin minutes, a police officer on the scene radioed to report cases of gunshot wounds \u201cto the chest, legs, terminal arteries at the medical tent.\u201dA few minutes later, an officer said, \u201cWe\u2019re making tourniquets out of blankets, but I\u2019m running out of blankets here.\u201dReporting was contributed by Ken Belson, Jennifer Medina, Mitch Smith and John Eligon from Las Vegas; Julie Turkewitz from Mesquite, Nev.; Russell Goldman from Hong Kong; Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Eileen Sullivan and Rebecca R.

{"Headline": "Small Endowments May Get to Invest in Bridgewater Associates", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world\u2019s biggest hedge fund is trying to get bigger, with the help of small endowments and foundations.Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund firm with $160 billion in assets under management, is in talks with Cambridge Associates about creating a dedicated investment fund to take in money from the consulting firm\u2019s institutional clients, which include endowments and foundations, said two people familiar with those talks who are not authorized to speak publicly.Bridgewater, founded in 1975 by Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor, generally requires that clients have at least $7.5 billion of investable assets in order to put money into the hedge fund. Many investors pay at least $500,000 \u2014 and sometimes as much as $4 million \u2014 a year in fees to Bridgewater.Those thresholds, among the highest in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry, put Bridgewater out of reach for all but a sliver of the world\u2019s biggest institutional investors.The arrangement under discussion with Cambridge would pool together investment dollars from the firm\u2019s clients so the new fund could meet Bridgewater\u2019s minimum requirements. The deal also would give Cambridge a better opportunity to negotiate lower fees and better terms with Bridgewater, which takes in most of its investment dollars directly from large institutional investors.Cambridge, in a statement, said it does not \u201cdiscuss manager relationships or details of fees and terms that we negotiate on behalf of our clients.\u201d A Bridgewater spokesman declined to comment.A number of Cambridge clients already have money with Bridgewater and would not be required to move money to the new investment fund.The possible arrangement with Cambridge is part of a broader effort by Bridgewater to rake in more assets.The firm is working on a new China-focused portfolio that will invest mainly in Chinese bonds, stocks and commodities. The fund will be open only to investors who do not live in China.Bridgewater\u2019s two main hedge fund portfolios \u2014 Pure Alpha and All Weather \u2014 both posted big market-beating returns in 2010 and 2011. But in recent years the performances of those funds have been far more modest.This year the Pure Alpha fund is down about 2 percent, and All Weather is up more than 8 percent through the end of September. The average hedge fund, as measured by Hedge Fund Research\u2019s broadest index, is up 5.7 percent this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing by Betting on the Sponsors of Sports", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout three years ago, he asked Nick Fullerton, a friend who is a financial planner, how they could make money off those teams and leagues even though almost none of them are publicly held.\u201cHe said, \u2018I have a crazy idea and let\u2019s see if it makes sense,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cWe started talking about sports, and revenue of the sports leagues, and how fast they were going versus the overall economy, and we tried to figure out how to invest in that.\u201dAs Mr. Kozimor recalled, he was struggling to figure out, \u201cHow can you participate on the owner level?\u201d and not merely be a spectator of profitable sports.Mr. Fullerton said he had then learned that since 2009, the shares of some publicly traded companies with sport sponsorships had outperformed their industry counterparts. He declined to provide supporting data.To embody that theory in a financial instrument, the partners turned to the Global Index Group in Seattle, which helped them create an exchange-traded fund that included dozens of companies with sponsorships with Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League and the National Hockey League, as well as with individual teams and broadcasters.\u201cWe wanted the investor to have an ownership role in their sports,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said.Unlike mutual funds, which are priced at the end of each trading day, E.T.F.s like ProSports Sponsors can be bought and sold like common stock. E.T.F.s are passively managed, so expenses are generally lower than those for actively managed funds.Investments in E.T.F.s have been growing faster than those in mutual funds as investors become more comfortable with them. According to Morningstar, over the past 18 years, the amount of assets invested in mutual funds has grown 9 percent per year compared with 34 percent growth in E.T.F.s. Matt Hougan, the chief executive of Inside E.T.F.s, which runs conferences and seminars, said that a cumulative $1.5 trillion has poured into E.T.F.s since 2008, while mutual funds have had a net outflow of $100 billion.\u201cE.T.F.s are like cellphones while mutual funds are like landlines,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a newer technology, a little cheaper, more tax efficient and more easily tradable.\u201dThe first E.T.F.s tracked familiar indexes like the S.& P. 500. But as their popularity has grown, companies have created a greater variety of funds, including ones based on popular themes as a way of appealing to more investors.To create their E.T.F., Mr. Fullerton and Mr. Kozimor listed the names of every official sponsor in the four major sports leagues. Of those 105 companies, they eliminated any that were not listed on an American or Canadian exchange or did not have an American Depositary Receipt.They then dropped companies that did not have a market capitalization of at least $1 billion or a certain amount of daily trading volume.That still left dozens of big companies, including Electronic Arts, which makes video games; CBS Corp., which televises N.F.L. games; and Under Armour, which makes gear that athletes wear.\u201cWe created this so you can invest in what you know,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said.The fund\u2019s start date, July 11, coincided with Major League Baseball\u2019s All-Star game, and it rose 4.7 percent through September. It had about $4 million in assets under management, Ben Jaffe, a fund spokesman, said.One question for the broader E.T.F. market is whether such funds are being sliced too thin, and whether hyper-specialized ones like ProSports Sponsors are performing well enough to justify higher expense ratios than more traditional funds.Alex Bryan, who tracks E.T.F.s for Morningstar, does not cover the sports fund because it is so new. But he said he was skeptical that these specialized funds were worth the extra expense. Some fund managers cherry-pick statistics to make the stocks in their funds look like they performed better than those of their peers.Mr. Bryan added that some managers marketed their niche funds to appeal to investors who wanted to put their money in companies that sold things they understood. But, he said, it was not even clear how much money companies like Geico and Ford Motors earned from being sponsors of pro sports leagues, and therefore the effects of sponsorship on their stock prices were muddy.It may simply be, he said, that big companies have the money to spend on such sponsorships.\u201cFirms that have enough money to spend on sport sponsorships may just have more money,\u201d he said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any obvious connection between sports sponsorships and stock performance.\u201dThe fund has not been around long enough to know whether it will be a sensible investment, but it certainly provides fans with a familiar choice.\u201cPeople get sports, people get advertising,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cA lot of products, you need a Ph.D. to understand.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Bonds Aren\u2019t Boring Right Now", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market\u2019s relentless gains have been getting the big headlines but the bond market\u2019s performance has been startling, too \u2014 and in ways that are troubling for many investors.Stocks and bonds are complementary partners in standard portfolios. While stocks typically have a higher return potential, bonds are generally less risky and provide a hedge against a stock market plunge, as they did during the bear market that started in 2007.The dilemma now is that despite a rocky bond market over the last month, bond prices are still so high \u2014 and their yields so low \u2014 that bonds simply can\u2019t provide much buffering.\u201cIt\u2019s inescapable,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. \u201cAt their current prices, bonds can\u2019t help as much in a stock downturn. And the likelihood is that in the next few years, bond returns won\u2019t be very good, either.\u201dThese gloomy tidings from the bond market have been overwhelmed by spectacular news on the stock side of things. Stocks have been surging for more than eight years and anyone lucky enough to have money in the market that long is sitting on sizable gains. Is it time to cash out of stocks? Maybe. But it\u2019s possible that the good times will continue to roll.As Laszlo Birinyi, the independent stock strategist who has been correctly bullish since early 2009, wrote in a note to clients this past week: \u201cOur strategy remains unchanged. Stay invested, expect higher prices and ignore the noise from both the bulls and the bears.\u201d Mr. Birinyi monitors fund flows in and out of stocks closely, and he says they provide a neutral signal. \u201cThe market continues to forecast a grinding trend,\u201d he said.Upward momentum is in the stock market\u2019s favor. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t simply die of old age,\u201d Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that would cause the bull market to end.\u201dBut stocks over all are no longer cheap. While the economy is still growing, despite evident political turmoil in Washington and elsewhere around the globe, it is easy to make a case for extreme caution in the stock market, given its elevated levels.That is age-old advice. There is a problem with it right now, though: This is not an ideal moment to be putting money into bonds.The immediate outlook for fixed-income investments isn\u2019t wonderful, many strategists say. After all, bond prices rallied for many years, too, and are already at high levels. Yields, which move in the opposite direction, are extremely low on a historical basis, though they have been rising lately.The last month, in fact, has been a poor one for bonds. The benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index declined by half a percentage point. That would be negligible for the broad stock market but it\u2019s a lot for bonds and it could presage further difficulties ahead.While it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint cause and effect, there are several logical explanations for the recent run-up in bond yields \u2014 and the decline in prices. They appear to be a consequence of expectations for change in both monetary policy \u2014 orchestrated by the Federal Reserve and other central banks \u2014 and in fiscal policy, which is the product of politicians in Washington and other capitals.Briefly, the Fed has begun raising short-term interest rates and reversing the expansion of its balance sheet. It says it is likely to keep doing so, assuming that economic growth continues and inflation rises. Those changes in themselves could disrupt the bond market.Then, there are the bond market ripples caused by potential shifts in fiscal policy, including changes in the tax code. The details of an eventual tax overhaul \u2014 if there is one \u2014 are impossible to know now. But that hasn\u2019t stopped investors from calculating the odds of various outcomes. A combination of rising government deficits and declining Federal Reserve bond holdings could produce the equivalent of an earthquake for fixed-income investors. Yields could rise sharply and prices could plummet.\u201cIt\u2019s only the last few weeks that these possibilities have begun to be priced into bond prices,\u201d Mr. Ripley said.The bond market turmoil leaves investors in a bit of a muddle. The central reasons for holding bonds remain intact: Bonds will still buffer a portfolio and generate income. But in the near future, they aren\u2019t likely to do so as effectively as in the past.Prudent people should temper their expectations. That\u2019s the advice of a man with a formidable track record, John Bogle, who founded Vanguard. \u201cCurrent bond yields are an excellent predictor of returns for the next 10 years,\u201d he reminded me in a phone conversation. Based on current yields, he estimated, a portfolio containing a mix of government and corporate bonds is likely to generate an annualized return of only about 3 percent.That\u2019s not much. But it\u2019s not far behind his expectation for stocks. After the titanic rally, which has produced tremendous profits, he said, stocks have outrun fundamental values through \u201cspeculation\u201d and are, therefore, likely to produce annualized stock returns of only 4 percent over the next decade, he said.\u201cCompared with stocks,\u201d he said, \u201cbonds are a good value, better than they have been in years.\u201dIt still makes sense to hold stocks and bonds in a diversified portfolio, he said, and his estimates are only that, estimates. Think it through for yourself, he said, and draw your own conclusions. Just be realistic about them.\u201cInvest for the long run but don\u2019t expect too much,\u201d Mr. Bogle said. \u201cIf you do that, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201dAn earlier version of a graphic accompanying this article mislabeled the scale of an E.T.F. that tracks the bond market. It is a measure of an index, not a price.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hiking Mountains, Gladly, With a Marine Turned Fund Manager", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFORT INDIANTOWN GAP, Pa. \u2014 It was 9 p.m., and about 60 financial executives chattered nervously outside a barrack full of bunk beds at this United States Army training post in central Pennsylvania.They had come from New York, Toronto, Philadelphia and beyond at the behest of Wesley R. Gray, an investment manager and former Marine Corps officer, to trek 28 miles through the mountains. The truly motivated would lug 30-pound packs.\u201cWe are here to march for the fallen,\u201d Mr. Gray shouted, describing the next day\u2019s hike as a \u201chaze ex,\u201d Marine jargon for a hazing exercise. He distributed dogtags of troops who had died in battle, ordering that they be worn on the march.In the cult-like world of machine-driven, systematic investing, chasing the latest philosopher king up a mountain counts as just another day at the office.He has attracted an intense following among billionaire investors, pension funds and exchange-traded-fund junkies who reject the old Wall Street way of mutual and hedge fund managers charging steep fees for mediocre returns.That Mr. Gray, who is 37, was once an embedded adviser to the Iraqi Army, works out of a garage in suburban Philadelphia and uses the Marine Corps motto Semper Fi to sign off on emails has only added to his mystique.Since his days studying finance in college, Mr. Gray has been trying to devise computer models that can unearth stock market winners more efficiently than fund managers.The explosion in popularity of exchange traded funds, which track market indexes while trading like a stock on a public exchange, has allowed him to put his theory to the test.\u201cEverything we do is based on how we get rid of the human and how we program instead,\u201d Mr. Gray said.By design, Mr. Gray\u2019s funds are volatile. His algorithms target stocks that appear deeply undervalued or poised for explosive growth. Those are the same types of stocks that tend to be susceptible to violent price movements.The September trek was organized by the Pennsylvania National Guard to honor fallen troops. For the past two years, Mr. Gray has used the event as a venue for like-minded investors to gather in an unconventional setting.At 8 a.m. on the day of the hike, Mr. Gray was among a swarm of about 500 civilians and enlisted personnel pushing up the mountainside. His group included a few clients and a collection of investment advisers and E.T.F. specialists who, beyond their shared interest in high finance, wanted to see if they could keep up with Mr. Gray. There were also several job applicants whom he was judging for mental toughness.Mr. Gray was walking briskly, and he bore his 40-pound pack with ease.He is a compact, wiry man who wears his hair military-style short. He livens up long riffs on efficient markets theory with persistent profanity.In contrast to his interviewer, his conversation was not interrupted by heavy breathing.Growing up on a ranch in Colorado, Mr. Gray had a gift for numbers as well as a desire to serve his country.In 2011, he fielded a phone call from Edward J. Stern, the son of the billionaire investor Leonard Stern. The younger Mr. Stern was responsible for investing the family fortune, and he had grown frustrated with humans as investors, having seen firsthand the losses his fund managers had racked up during the financial crisis. He was taken with Mr. Gray\u2019s musings about building computer models that, in theory, would be cheaper and more efficient than paying high fees to a fallible hedge fund hotshot.\u201cHe opened my eyes to systematic, quant, get-the-human-element-out style of investing,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cIt made a lot of sense to me.\u201dAfter a few years of consulting with Mr. Stern, Mr. Gray persuaded him to seed a fund that would deploy these strategies with $20 million.Today, Mr. Gray\u2019s fund manages just over $700 million on behalf of pension funds and wealthy individuals and families.Mr. Gray still works out of his garage. There are now seven employees, four of whom have military backgrounds \u2014 including a Navy pilot, a combat engineer from the Army and one other Marine.Mr. Gray says that when he hires, the first thing he looks for are people skilled in explaining arcane financial topics to a broader audience, via white papers, podcasts and various forms of social media.So don\u2019t bother asking him how he markets his funds.While he has attracted sophisticated institutions and multimillionaires to invest in his main fund, it remains unclear how successful he will be at persuading smaller (and less knowledgeable) investors to purchase his E.T.F.s.\u201cThey are not for everyone,\u201d said Ben Johnson, an E.T.F. expert at Morningstar and a participant in the march. Indeed, Mr. Johnson said, referring to the volatility of Mr. Gray\u2019s funds, \u201cyou have to be willing to have your face ripped off from time to time.\u201dIn a way, it was that willingness that led 60 middle-aged finance professionals (and one senseless reporter) to march up and down mountains, with heavy packs, in 80-degree heat \u2014 on a Saturday, no less.The hardier among us finished the course in eight hours.That group did not include Mr. Gray.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Charges Ahead, Despite the World\u2019s Storms", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHurricanes in North America, earthquakes in Latin America, tensions on the Korean Peninsula and political turbulence in the United States, Germany and Spain have produced little but shrugs on Wall Street.The stock market\u2019s rise \u2014 not just in recent monthsbut for eight years \u2014 suggests that traders are convinced the Federal Reserve will meet any meaningful decline with fresh steps to prop stocks up. In the bond market, by contrast, rising yields betray a growing sense that monetary policy will become a headwind.If that belief spreads to the stock market, fund managers and investment strategists warn, it could disrupt a long bull run that has left stocks expensive by historical yardsticks and more susceptible to a decline.That something, Ms. Scott said, could be an economy that is \u201csomewhat more strong than people appreciate,\u201d leading to a faster pace of rate hikes. That would be especially hard on stocks in high-growth sectors like technology that have been strong performers lately.She acknowledged that the fund owns \u201ca lot of expensive growth stocks\u201d and said that she was taking some profits and putting the money into areas such as health care and business services.If the yield curve goes beyond flattening, into outright inversion, with short rates above long rates, it might be a sign of a recession, so even a flattening yield curve is worrisome.\u201cIt has been often said that the smartest guy in the room is the yield curve,\u201d Mr. Rivelle said. The flattening could be \u201csignaling that prospects for growth and inflation are more muted.\u201dStocks nonetheless reached new highs in the third quarter this year, unmoved by warnings from Fed officials that monetary policy would be tightening. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 4 percent for the quarter.The Fed\u2019s signals seemed to be taken more seriously in the bond market. Treasury issues rallied initially, then sold off, leaving the 10-year note yielding 2.33 percent at the end of the quarter, compared with 2.3 percent three months earlier and well above its 2.06 percent yield in early September.Mr. Rivelle advised investors to emphasize shorter-term \u201csecurities that focus on more dull parts of the bond market,\u201d such as high-quality municipal issues, AAA-rated mortgages and government-guaranteed student loans. He said he was \u201cmore skeptical of high-yield and emerging markets.\u201d\u201cIf you wanted to take a walk on the wild side,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should have been doing that in 2010.\u201dThe average domestic stock fund returned 4.2 percent, led by a 5.5 percent gain for specialists in larger growth stocks. Technology was the big winner among sector funds, rising 9 percent.Optimists contend that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy has been close to ideal, and that the stock and bond markets are reacting appropriately.Mr. Sanchez said he anticipated a gradual rise in interest rates for the rest of the year and a \u201cshallow rise\u201d in 2018. And while he finds the economic backdrop benign for bonds, he acknowledged that they are \u201cpriced for optimal inflation,\u201d leaving them at risk if his appraisal is off.\u201cRight now we see no signals that tell us the cycle is about to end,\u201d he said. \u201cThe upshot is we\u2019re going to get a steeper yield curve and see bond yields gradually moving higher.\u201d As for stocks, he added, \u201cthe bottom line is this is still a constructive environment.\u201dExpanded margins and price-earnings multiples are responsible for more than half of the advance of the present bull run, the report shows. They are all but certain to snap back, probably before long, it warns.That leads GMO to forecast a decline of 3.9 percent a year for the next seven years for stocks of large American companies, with smaller companies and developed foreign markets doing better, but still losing ground. The only stock markets that GMO expects to produce gains, of 2.9 percent a year, are in emerging economies. Most bonds are expected to lose money, too, with emerging markets again doing best.Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, echoed the belief that investors had few places to hide. He examined valuations of 15 stock markets and 15 bond markets since 1800 and concluded that \u201cat an aggregate level, an equally weighted bond/equity portfolio has never been more expensive.\u201d Bonds alone have never had such rich valuations, meaning low yields, since 1800, he said, and stocks have been more expensive just over 10 percent of the time.Mr. Reid said the high valuations come at a particularly fraught time, because of \u201cthe incredibly unique size of central bank balance sheets, debt levels, multi-century all-time lows in interest rates and even the level of potentially game-changing populist political support around the globe.\u201dRich valuations were among the factors that prompted warnings in the third quarter of an imminent correction in stocks. In September, Citi Research put the odds that one would begin in the succeeding three months at 45 percent. Citi cited the flattening yield curve and soft growth in earnings, along with the high valuations, in explaining its estimate.Other firms used snippets of data to argue that a decline was anything but imminent.The stock market seldom falls just because it is overvalued; there usually is another catalyst. A more aggressive Fed is one obvious candidate, but not the only one.Wall Street has been largely unperturbed by North Korea\u2019s missile tests, but that would almost certainly change if a war ensues. Efforts to change the federal health care and tax laws remain works in progress \u2014 without much progress \u2014 potentially testing investors\u2019 patience. Ramifications of a stronger than expected showing by the far right in Germany\u2019s elections and a violent crackdown by the authorities in Spain as Catalonians voted overwhelmingly for independence in a referendum could unnerve the markets, too.If overvaluation does not cause declines, it exacerbates them once they start. Some investment advisers are gravitating toward foreign markets because they are cheaper and, especially in Europe and Japan, have central banks that continue to flood the economies with cash.\u201cI think it\u2019s very early in their cycle,\u201d Mr. Sanchez of Fiduciary Trust said of those markets. \u201cThere was a rolling debt crisis in Europe for six or seven years. After having a subdued growth profile, there\u2019s some pent-up demand there, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S.\u201dThe average international stock fund rose a healthy 5.4 percent in the third quarter, led by gains of 7.9 percent in emerging markets, 10.9 percent in China and 18 percent in Latin America.Mr. Turnill of BlackRock said that investors were \u201cpaid to take risk in emerging markets in particular.\u201d As for international markets in general, he cited their lower valuations and \u201chigher operational leverage to economic expansion,\u201d meaning that earnings of companies there were more sensitive to a pickup in activity than those of American companies.Both strategists also like American stocks. Mr. Turnill is partial to the technology and financial sectors, while Mr. Sanchez favors larger companies over smaller ones, although he noted that an overhaul of the tax code would benefit smaller companies.Mr. Sanchez, emphasizing his enthusiasm for stocks, said: \u201cWe have good macro, good micro, and financial conditions are as optimal as they possibly can get.\u201dDoesn\u2019t that mean things can only get worse? Even if the Fed is steering the economy well enough and North Korea is steering its missiles into open water instead of at people, other adverse developments can pop up and hurt markets that are expensive and therefore vulnerable.Mr. Sanchez acknowledged that no matter how good the times are, it is still wise to moderate expectations.\u201cI think market returns will become more modest and more subject to volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect more of the same from an economic standpoint, but I think it\u2019s very unlikely to expect the risk/return profile we\u2019ve had to date.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economy Is Humming. Bankers Are Cheering. What Could Go Wrong?", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the global economy has been defined by dissonance.There has been the Japanese recession. The financial crises in the United States and Europe. And drama in emerging markets throughout.But as central bankers, finance ministers and money managers descend on Washington this week for the fall meetings of the International Monetary Fund, they will confront an unusual reality: global markets and economies rising in unison.Never mind political turmoil, populist uprisings and threats of nuclear war. From Wall Street to Washington, economists have been upgrading their forecasts for the global economy this year, with the consensus now pointing to an expansion of more than 3 percent \u2014 up noticeably from 2.6 percent in 2016.Economists from the I.M.F. are likely to follow suit when the fund releases its biannual report on the global economy on Tuesday.The rosy numbers are noteworthy. But what\u2019s more startling is that virtually every major developed and emerging economy is growing simultaneously, the first time this has happened in 10 years.\u201cIn terms of positive cycles, it is difficult to find very many precedents here,\u201d said Brian Coulton, the chief economist at Fitch, the debt ratings agency. \u201cIt is the strongest growth we have seen since 2010.\u201dIn Japan, a reform-minded government and aggressive action by the central bank have pushed growth to 1.5 percent \u2014 up from 0.3 percent three years ago.In Europe, strong domestic demand in Germany and robust recoveries in countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy are expected to spur 2.2 percent growth in the eurozone. That would be more than double its average annual growth in the previous five years.Aggressive infrastructure spending by China; bold economic reforms by countries including Brazil, Indonesia and India; and rising commodities prices (helping countries such as Russia) have spurred growth in emerging markets.And in the United States, despite doubts about President Trump\u2019s ability to pass a major tax bill, the economy and financial markets chug along.In fact, one of the few large economies not following an upward path is Britain, whose pending exit from the European Union is taking a toll. Having grown at an average annual pace of just over 2 percent from 2012 to 2016, the British economy is expanding just 1.5 percent this year.Still, the good news may result in some backslapping this week for policy makers and regulators more accustomed in recent years to putting out financial fires than basking in improved economic well-being.\u201cThe meetings will celebrate this period of synchronized economic growth and calm financial markets,\u201d said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser to the fund giant Allianz.Mr. El-Erian, for example, said he was nervous about several possibilities: that global growth could taper off; that prices of stocks, bonds and other financial assets are unsustainably high; and, most important, that markets might not be prepared when central banks reverse their efforts to stimulate economies by keeping interest rates low and buying huge sums of assets.But for the time being, investors, economists and policy officials point to a growing quantity of data that highlight the power of this recent burst of economic growth.A big driver for growth in emerging markets, said Mr. Coulton, the economist at Fitch, has been Chinese imports, which are up more than 10 percent this year. China is the world\u2019s largest consumer of raw materials such as oil, steel and copper, and it is increasingly buying them from emerging economies.Global portfolio managers like Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners, who oversees $9 billion, have been quick to capitalize, snapping up shares of Russian banks and French construction companies.\u201cThe global economy looks pretty darn good,\u201d Mr. Jain said.But with interest rates still historically low, investors have been pushing into even riskier assets, including the bonds of emerging-market economies, to eke out returns.Some countries are taking advantage of the frenzy by issuing more debt. Argentina recently sold so-called century bonds, which don\u2019t come due for 100 years. Jordan and Ukraine issued government bonds that mature in 30 years and 15 years, respectively.Susan Lund, an expert on global financial trends at the McKinsey Global Institute, said these types of investments from global asset managers tended to be longer term \u2014 and thus less destabilizing \u2014 than the so-called hot money from commercial banks that contributed to recent debt crises in the United States and Europe.Are things getting too hot?\u201cWe are in a boom today, but we should not forget that the financial system is still relatively unstable,\u201d said Jim Reid, a credit strategist at Deutsche Bank.Pick your poison: an abrupt slowdown in China, the rise of populism, debt problems in Japan or an ugly outcome to Britain\u2019s move to leave the European Union.His overriding worry, though, is that investors and policy makers aren\u2019t prepared for what will happen when global central banks put a halt to their easy-money policies.Since the 2008 crisis, Mr. Reid noted, central banks have accumulated more than $14 trillion in assets \u2014 an amount that exceeds the annual output of China by $3 trillion.What happens when the central banks all start to sell?\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cAnd no one knows what the outcome will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Today: A Bull Runs Free in Brooklyn", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this fresh Wednesday.A brown bull put on a quite a show in Prospect Park yesterday.The animal made his way through the streets of Brooklyn to the park around 11 a.m.On his way there, he meandered through Park Slope, where Rosie Schaap, 46, a writer (and contributor to The Times) who lives in the neighborhood, found him. She said she thought it was a pair of children wearing a cow costume charging up the block.\u201cBut it was stunning to me how fast it was moving,\u201d Ms. Schaap said. By the time it passed her, she realized it was a bull.\u201cThe most remarkable thing was that it stayed on the sidewalk,\u201d she said.After breaking into the park, the young bull seemed to grow sheepish (pardon us), slowing down to spend nearly an hour stock-still on the artificial grass of a sports field, staring back at dozens of gawkers who had gathered on the other side of a chain-link fence to watch.A high-speed chase it was not.The spectators were joined by thousands more online, after a live TV helicopter feed on ABC 7 showed the cow prancing around the park \u2014 and, spoiler, his eventual capture by the police.But it wasn\u2019t all utter nonsense.On his freedom run, the bull knocked over a stroller with a child, who was taken to an area hospital, according to the police.As unusual as the incident seemed, renegade cows and bulls have happened before in the city.The Brooklyn bull was eventually brought down by tranquilizer, administered at about 1 p.m., and led into a trailer about 30 minutes later, according to the police.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Get mooving, a fabulous fall day is ahead.Your morning commute looks nice, if nippy.

The National Rifle Association said in a statement on Thursday that it \u201cbelieves that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.\u201dSlide Fire \u2014 which boasts on its website that it \u201crevolutionized recreational shooting\u201d \u2014 soon ran out of stock and stopped taking orders.But bump stocks, he said, can help a semiautomatic firearm recreate the adrenaline-inducing power of an automatic weapon.\u201cSome people like drag racing, some people like skiing and some people, like me, love full auto,\u201d he told Ammoland.Fiercely protective of his creation, Mr. Cottle has repeatedly \u2014 and successfully \u2014 sued competitors for patent infringement. But before this week, the product remained largely obscure except in certain gun enthusiast circles.\u201cIt was only ever a niche product to begin with \u2014 it was a tiny component of the industry that wasn\u2019t really well known,\u201d said Rommel Dionisio, managing director at Aegis Capital. \u201cIt was never a significant seller.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s considered the Mr. Potato Head of firearms, because you can put a lot of different accessories on it \u2014 barrels, sound suppressors, scopes and more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe accessories market exploded.\u201dEquipment, apparel and supplies constitute 12.8 percent of the $2.5 billion online gun and ammunition industry, with ammunition, handguns and long guns making up the rest, according to IBISWorld, a market research firm.Slide Fire sells online and also through a retail network that, within 11 months of starting business, included 500 outlets, according to The Albany News.Mr. Cottle joined the military at 19 and was in the Air Force for nine years, attaining the rank of staff sergeant. He was involved in the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts, and medically retired from the military after developing meningitis and encephalitis, he told The Abilene Reporter-News in 2006.Back in Texas, while out shooting with a friend, Mr. Cottle was frustrated with his weapon\u2019s firing speed, according to The Albany News. He crafted a prototype bump stock out of wood and metal in two hours.The letter noted that the stock \u201chas no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed.\u201d It also mentioned that Mr. Cottle\u2019s letter had described the bump stock as \u201cintended to assist persons whose hands have limited mobility to \u2018bump-fire\u2019 an AR-15 type rifle.\u201dSlide Fire\u2019s product \u201cgrants shooters the freedom of controlled rapid fire without compromising the safety of themselves or others around them,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website. Mr. Cottle has appeared on YouTube promoting his bump stocks, priced from $140 to $300.But the internet also abounds with tutorials on how to gin up homemade versions of the accessory using belt loops and rubber bands. On YouTube, videos show AR-15 rifles equipped with 3D-printed bump stocks and \u201cbump boards\u201d made of wood.Mr. Cottle is listed as an inventor on several slide-action stock patents and has doggedly defended his products against copycats.\u201cThe technology sets our company apart,\u201d Mr. Cottle said in a video on the company website. \u201cThere is no one that does what we do.\u201dIn 2014, Slide Fire sued Bump Fire, a company selling $99 bump stocks. Slide Fire alleged infringement on eight of its patents, winning a court judgment last year that forced Bump Fire to stop producing and selling stocks that functionally mirror Slide Fire\u2019s products.Back home, Slide Fire is seen as a hometown anchor of sorts. Mr. Cottle hired local residents, including a former teacher and a neighbor, and became a major employer in the area, according to The Albany News.He told the publication that the company\u2019s success was a miracle.\u201cThis is beyond a Cinderella story,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Growing Call for New Look at \u2018Bump Stocks,\u2019 Including From the N.R.A.", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith support building in Congress for action against devices like those the Las Vegas gunman had, which allow a rifle to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, the National Rifle Association on Thursday endorsed tighter restrictions on the gadgets, but did not say they should be outlawed.The stance by the N.R.A., and growing support for regulation from Republicans on Capitol Hill, represent a small but notable shift for an organization and political party that have consistently opposed any gun controls for many years.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has said that the apparatus does not violate federal laws that, since the 1930s, have sharply limited the manufacture and possession of fully automatic weapons, or machine guns. In a statement on Thursday, the N.R.A. said the bureau should revisit the issue and \u201cimmediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.\u201d\u201cThe N.R.A. believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations,\u201d the group said.\u201cBump stocks\u201d are attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster, almost like machine guns. Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.Sales of bump stocks surged this week, after news emerged that they might have been used in the Las Vegas shooting. Some retailers ran out of the devices, even as others decided to stop offering them on their websites.In the House, Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, has drafted a measure banning bump stocks, and he said on Thursday that his office has been flooded with calls from \u201cdozens\u201d of his fellow Republicans, who want to sign on.\u201cI think we are on the verge of a breakthrough when it comes to sensible gun policy,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said.His comments followed those of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who during a morning interview with MSNBC also raised questions about the conversions, and said he was open to legislation. \u201cClearly that\u2019s something we need to look into,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.Separately, Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, is circulating a letter among his colleagues, calling on the A.T.F. to re-evaluate bump stocks, which he said have \u201cno place in civilized society.\u201dBut gun control advocates drew a sharp distinction between a ban, like that proposed by Senator Feinstein, and merely asking the firearms agency to re-evaluate the matter, as the N.R.A. and Mr. Kinzinger have.\u201cIf they had actually said we support bipartisan legislation, you might have characterized it as a concession,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cBut they\u2019re actually just punting it back to the very federal agency that said bump stocks were legal. I don\u2019t think this is a concession, it\u2019s just a wink and a nod.\u201dIn its statement, the N.R.A. also urged Congress to pass one of the group\u2019s highest legislative priorities, a bill that would allow anyone who is licensed by one state to carry a concealed weapon to do so in any other state that allows concealed carry. The organization did not explicitly tie concealed carry reciprocity to regulation of rapid-fire devices, but another pro-gun group did.Gun Owners of America said Thursday that it opposed a bump stock ban, but added in a statement, \u201cIf law makers want a vote on bump stocks, they should vote on reciprocity as well.\u201dFifty-eight people were killed in the Las Vegas massacre. The same number were killed by gun violence in 28 days in Chicago.Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, accused the N.R.A. of pursuing \u201ca road to nonaction.\u201d He noted that a regulation \u2014 as opposed to a law \u2014 could take years to enact, and that Democrats have opposed the reciprocity measure.\u201cI think it\u2019s a highly dangerous and deceptive dodge,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal, who is co-sponsoring legislation to ban bump stocks, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s typical N.R.A. evasion and avoidance of reality; the simple, stark political fact is there is growing support for a ban, a complete prohibition.\u201dOn a fully automatic weapon, when the user pulls the trigger, the weapon will quickly fire round after round, until the trigger is released or the magazine empties. On a semiautomatic, each pull of the trigger fires a single bullet, and reloads the weapon for the next shot. Military assault rifles can be fired either in automatic or semiautomatic mode; similar-looking guns sold on the American civilian market are semiautomatic only.But there are a few devices on the market that make a semiautomatic weapon mimic the much higher rate of fire of a fully automatic one \u2014 though accuracy typically suffers, and the weapon can overheat, damaging it or quickly making it hard to handle. The devices include bump stocks, trigger cranks, and what are sometimes called rapid-reset triggers, any of which allow a semiautomatic weapon to fire faster than a human finger can pull a trigger, unassisted.Recordings of the Las Vegas shooting include the sound of extremely rapid shooting, and police officers responding to the scene radioed that they believed they were under fire from fully automatic weapons. That could be explained by the bump stocks Mr. Paddock had, though law enforcement officials have not said definitively whether he actually used those devices.The officials have said Mr. Paddock, who fatally shot himself, fired multiple rifles during the shooting, which would be consistent with weapons fitted with bump stocks overheating. Photographs that have leaked of the hotel suite appear to show his left hand encased in a mitt, which could have been protection against overheating.Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a reported from New York, and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Kurt Vonnegut Found His Voice and His Themes", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one: I once stalked Kurt Vonnegut.There\u2019s a sort of writer \u2014 often male, typically born in the mid- to late-20th century \u2014 for whom this won\u2019t be a surprise, for whom \u201cVonnegut\u201d is practically a stage of development (it comes somewhere between adolescence and first rejection letter).In 1986, I was that sort, a college journalism student and young father who secured suspect press credentials to interview the famous novelist when he came to my hometown to lecture at Gonzaga University. As we settled into a classroom, I shakily read the first question in my spiral notebook (\u201cUm, if you could give advice to a young writer \u2026\u201d).\u201cOh, uh, I\u2019m 20.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re writing for Esquire?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d I admitted, \u201cthey haven\u2019t actually accepted the piece yet.\u201dDespite my dubious credentials, Vonnegut spent the next 15 minutes generously offering advice on how to be a writer \u2014 or, at least how he\u2019d done it. After surviving the Dresden firebombing as a prisoner in World War II and working briefly in public relations, he supported his family writing short stories for the rich 1950s magazine market, where he developed the wry, aphoristic voice that would lead to his career as a beloved novelist and moral sage.I found myself thinking back to that 30-year-old advice (which was 30 years old when he gave it) while lugging around the huge volume of Vonnegut\u2019s newly released \u201cComplete Stories.\u201d Even in 1986, Vonnegut mused that his path was about as relevant \u201cas how to repair a Model T.\u201dThis is the 911-page question \u2014 what to make of a trunkful of stories written (and often, rejected) 60 years ago for a market with such narrow specs: short, kicky stories for white, middle-class readers with a snap at the end worthy of O. Henry (or better yet, \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d).For completists, this will be like a boxed set of a musician\u2019s early work \u2014 Vonnegut\u2019s Sun Studio sessions \u2014 98 stories, including five recovered from the author\u2019s papers at Indiana University and published for the first time here.Most of these stories were written for mainstream magazines like Collier\u2019s, Ladies\u2019 Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and The Saturday Evening Post. Those slicks paid a handsome 50 cents a word, but Vonnegut sometimes settled for the down-market penny-a-word sci-fi magazines like the brilliantly named Worlds of If.It\u2019s fascinating to watch him work themes that would later animate his 14 novels and five books of nonfiction: the cruel stupidity of war, the dehumanizing dangers of technology, the distillation of American values into mere greed and selfishness. Longtime readers will recognize familiar Vonnegut characters and settings alongside pleas for peace and personal decency. Throughout, too, there runs Vonnegut\u2019s 30-year attempt to find a narrative form to contain the horrors of Dresden, bits of his masterpiece \u201cSlaughterhouse-Five\u201d sprinkled like ash in stories such as \u201cGreat Day,\u201d in which the author first uses time travel to write about war.It\u2019s also fun watching a young Vonnegut try on other styles, as in his nod to noir, \u201cMr. Z,\u201d in which a theology student interviews a woman in prison, \u201ca trinket brunette \u2026 hard as nails,\u201d who, talking about an old boyfriend\u2019s death, \u201cdidn\u2019t sound sorry. She didn\u2019t even sound interested.\u201d\u201cComplete Stories\u201d was compiled and edited by Vonnegut\u2019s longtime friend Dan Wakefield and the scholar Jerome Klinkowitz, and they do a great job contextualizing the work \u2014 an enterprise Klinkowitz refers to as \u201cShort Stories of the 1950s, Inc., Kurt Vonnegut, proprietor.\u201d The editors divide them into eight categories: war, women, science, romance, work ethic versus fame and fortune, behavior, \u201cthe band director\u201d and futuristic. These divisions don\u2019t entirely cohere (show me a story that wouldn\u2019t fit into a file labeled \u201cbehavior\u201d) but they do get at the author\u2019s persistent themes.Before each section, Klinkowitz and Wakefield point out recurring bits, tell us about acceptances and rejections and offer Vonnegut\u2019s own thoughts on things, quoting for instance the poignant 1949 letter to his father upon his first acceptance: \u201cI think I\u2019m on my way.\u201dThere\u2019s also a lovely foreword by Dave Eggers, who has his own meeting-Vonnegut story (\u201cHe was everything you would have wanted him to be. Gentle, funny and quick to laugh\u201d) and who observes that the lost art here might be the so-called moral story: \u201cWhat\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong \u2026 how to live. In 2017, this is a radical act.\u201dIt all adds up to a fascinating portrait-of-the-artist-on-the-make in the booming 1950s.And it makes you wish the stories were better.Oh, there are some classics here \u2014 \u201cHarrison Bergeron,\u201d \u201cLong Walk to Forever,\u201d \u201cThe Hyannis Port Story\u201d \u2014 but those have been available in book form since at least 1968, when Vonnegut first culled the pile to make up his collection \u201cWelcome to the Monkey House.\u201dThe mining of Vonnegut\u2019s older, fragmentary and dated work has been a going concern for 20 years, accelerated by his death in 2007 at age 84.Since then, there have been at least four collections of lost, unpublished and \u201cnewly discovered\u201d work (most of which reappears in \u201cComplete Stories\u201d), a book of interviews and conversations, a book of letters, a book of drawings, a book of advice for the young, a book of graduation speeches and \u201cThe Vonnegut Encyclopedia.\u201d That\u2019s to say nothing of mugs, votive candles, T-shirts and a Twitter feed beaming out daily Vonnegutisms (\u201cI really wonder what gives us the right to wreck this poor planet of ours\u201d) to 214,000 followers.The author was still kicking when this excavation began, and he provided the most honest assessment of his own marginalia in his introduction to 1999\u2019s \u201cBagombo Snuff Box\u201d: \u201cThis old man\u2019s hope has to be that some of his earliest tales, for all their mildness and innocence and clumsiness, may \u2026 still entertain. \u2026 But there is no greatness in this or my other collection, nor was there meant to be.\u201dThat about covers it. Vonnegut wasn\u2019t going for interiority, character depth or musicality. Especially clumsy was his treatment of women and romance, as in the story \u201cUnpaid Consultant,\u201d in which an investment adviser, a stocks-and-bonds man, visits an old girlfriend: \u201cMost married women won\u2019t meet an old beau for cocktails, send him a Christmas card or even look him straight in the eye. But if they happen to need something an old beau sells \u2014 anything from an appendectomy to Venetian blinds \u2014 they\u2019ll come bouncing back into his life, all pink and smiling, to get it for wholesale or less.\u201dI wish I could report the narrator of that story is played as a fool. Instead, the female characters here are furniture or bouncing, pink operators. Of course you can\u2019t blame Vonnegut for society\u2019s sexism (in the 1950s, or now) but if these are indeed moral stories, it\u2019s a male, white, affluent morality. Vonnegut himself, as Wakefield writes, puzzled over his inability to \u201cdo women well.\u201dSimilarly, the dialects of some black waiters and soldiers and the poor will induce groans. As for the five stories from the archives, \u201cCity\u201d has a lovely back-and-forth alternating point of view between a boy and a girl meeting on a bus, but the rest might have stayed lost.That\u2019s not to say, answering the original question, that there\u2019s nothing relevant for the reader in 2017. Over and over, you imagine what the plain-spoken socialist war veteran from Indiana would make of our planet-destroying, science-denying, reality-TV American disaster.\u201cI used to wonder what was going to become of all the Americans like him,\u201d he writes at the end of a story called \u201cThe Epizootic,\u201d \u201ca bright and shiny new race that believed that life was a matter of making one\u2019s family richer and richer and richer, or it wasn\u2019t life. I often wondered what would become of them.\u201dWell, now we know: They get elected president.A bibliographic note with an earlier version of this review misspelled the name of one of the book\u2019s editors. He is Jerome Klinkowitz, not Klimkowitz.JESS WALTER\u2019S books include, most recently, the novel \u201cBeautiful Ruins\u201d and the story collection \u201cWe Live in Water.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Investor Tries to Shake Up Sina, a Pillar of China\u2019s Internet", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese internet boom has been good to Sina. Maybe, protests one of its American investors, it could have been better.Still, Sina finds itself embroiled in an unusual situation for a company with a surging stock price: a proxy fight. Aristeia Capital, a hedge fund based in Connecticut, is lobbying Sina shareholders to back its two candidates for the company\u2019s board in a bid to shake up Sina\u2019s business and give shareholders fatter returns. This week, the other shareholders will weigh in, casting their votes before a shareholder meeting set for Friday.Proxy fights in general are not uncommon, but one between a Chinese company and an American investor is the first of its kind, according to disclosures tracked by the data provider FactSet. And the campaign has helped to underscore the limits of foreign ownership of Chinese internet companies.Sina, one of the first Chinese tech companies to list its shares in New York, has called Aristeia \u201cself-serving\u201d and na\u00efve about how China\u2019s internet sector works.In turn, Aristeia, which manages $3 billion in investor money, has accused Sina of \u201cfailing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.\u201dForeign investors seem less than worried about any lack of control or lapses in corporate governance if the market is any indication. Shares in those companies have been on a tear in markets around the world as Chinese consumers reliably use their smartphones to buy electronics, shop for groceries, make investments, play games and look for dates.With more than 700 million users, China is the world\u2019s largest single internet market. Weibo has 313 million monthly average users.Still, some investors are quietly complaining about corporate governance practices.Chinese companies that list shares in the United States are not necessarily subject to American rules. Most are incorporated in light regulatory jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands.As a result, Chinese companies often behave differently. While Sina holds a regular annual meeting, some of its peers do not, a standard for the United States. Baidu, the search engine giant, has not held an annual shareholder meeting since 2008. JD.com, the online retailer, has never held one.\u201cInvestors have been getting a bit fed up with companies like Baidu and JD.com not having general meetings,\u201d said Jamie Allen, the secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association.A spokesman for JD.com said: \u201cInvestors appreciate our candor both on earnings calls and in engagement throughout the year. This issue has rarely, if ever, been raised to us.\u201d Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.Foreign investors also typically have fewer shareholder protections. To get around Chinese restrictions on outside investments in sensitive industries, many companies use a complicated legal structure, called a variable interest entity, or V.I.E. Under those arrangements, shareholders have rights to the profits of a company, but they do not control key assets \u2014 potentially leaving them exposed if the company runs into trouble or the Chinese government declares the structure illegal.Sina was a key player in the Chinese internet\u2019s emergence as a social and economic force. Its Weibo service, once derided by critics as a knockoff of Twitter, has grown in size and functionality to the point where it is now a must-read for many people.That separate listing helped set off the fight with Aristeia. Sina\u2019s shares have risen nearly 75 percent so far this year. But Weibo\u2019s performance has been better, with the stock more than doubling. Based on their stock market values, Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina \u2014 a gap that Aristeia says points to lackluster management and poor corporate governance.Sina uses a V.I.E. structure. Only one of the five director seats is available each year. The chairman and chief executive, Charles Chao, has a permanent position; the other members serve four-year terms.Aristeia is pushing for representation on the board so that directors will consider measures that would result in more money for shareholders. These include a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo or a buyback of shares by management.Sina says that any deal proposed by Aristeia would not clear because of China\u2019s complicated telecom and media rules. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, also owns a stake in Weibo, further complicating its options, Sina said.\u201cThe time, resources and capital invested to pursue a transaction with a high likelihood of failure, rather than accretive and value creating opportunities, is not in the best interests of Sina shareholders,\u201d Sina said in a statement.Some outsiders disagree. \u201cI think Sina has built in Weibo a very valuable asset that is not being reflected in its share price,\u201d said Randy Gelber, a managing director at UBS, the Swiss bank.\u201cIt would seem like there should be some common ground from both sides on how to realize that value,\u201d he said.Two proxy advisers \u2014 Glass Lewis & Company and International Shareholder Services \u2014 have given some weight to Aristeia\u2019s arguments. Glass Lewis recommended that Sina expand its board to allow Aristeia\u2019s nominees, and I.S.S. recommended that Sina shareholders support one of the two nominees.\u201cAn examination of the arguments reveals compelling reasons for shareholders to seek change at the company,\u201d I.S.S. said.It is also unfolding as the Chinese government looks to take a more active role in how its corporate giants are managed.Even if Aristeia emerges victorious, the real test could be whether its candidates will be able to push for change internally.\u201cThe question is whether that board member would be able to do anything other than jump up and down at meetings,\u201d said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management.videoAdvertisement"}

The performance threatens to add insult to injury. The last surviving original member of the Dow Jones industrial average risks being excluded from the benchmark.With roots that go back to Thomas Edison\u2019s electric-light company in the 1870s, G.E. was one of 12 companies selected by Dow Jones when it created its market indicator in 1896. While some, like the American Cotton Oil Company and the National Lead Company, have long since faded into history, G.E. became a symbol of American industrial prowess. It began electrifying the railways in the 1890s, built the first American jet engine in 1941 and supplied the silicon for Neil Armstrong\u2019s moon boots.

But there are a handful of policies that could reduce the likelihood of such events, or reduce the number of people killed when such shootings do occur. And several of them have strong public support.These are findings from surveys we conducted a year ago about the recurring problem of gun violence in the United States. We asked dozens of researchers in criminology, law and public health to assess a range of policies often proposed to prevent gun deaths. We also conducted a national poll to measure public support for the same set of measures.The policies in the upper right corner of our matrix are those that were deemed effective and popular. The most effective one, according to our experts, would be restricting gun sales to anyone found guilty of a violent crime. Under federal law, such limitations apply to those convicted of felonies or domestic violence crimes. That idea has not been debated much among federal policy makers.In general, the public was more accepting of measures limiting the types of people who could obtain weapons than of restrictions on the types of guns and accessories available on the market.We did not ask specifically about \u201cbump stocks,\u201d but we did ask about a broader set of gun modification restrictions that were part of a 1990s law known as the assault weapons ban, and about outlawing large-capacity ammunition magazines that enable rapid fire. Our experts thought both ideas could reduce the death toll from mass shootings, but they were not among the most popular ideas with the public.Select Measures That May Help Prevent Mass ShootingsWhen we developed our list of measures, we focused on policies that were not part of federal law. And we gathered ideas from advocates on the left and the right \u2013 some part of the mainstream political conversation, and some extremely unlikely to be considered.No state has adopted more than a handful of the ideas our experts deemed to be effective, but some states have adopted more of our experts\u2019 preferred measures than others. Nevada has adopted relatively few. In the accompanying table, we compared Nevada with California, which has been particularly aggressive about passing gun-control measures, and Mississippi, which is among the most permissive in its approach to firearms. The table omits policies that could be instituted only by the federal government.100% of Americans SupportUniversal checks for gun buyersEXperts say not effectiveSchool weapons banExperts Say Effective0% of Americans Support3.54.04.55.05.5100% of Americans SupportUniversal checks for gun buyersSchool weapons banEXperts say not effectiveExperts Say Effective0% of Americans Support3.54.04.55.05.5In 2016, Nevadans narrowly approved a ballot measure that called for instituting a universal background check for all gun purchases. Currently, people who buy guns from a federally licensed dealer must undergo a background check, but not those who buy guns from individuals, including at gun shows or through internet classified sites.The ballot initiative has not yet been enacted. The governor and attorney general, who oppose the policy, have said it is unenforceable because the F.B.I. has not agreed to conduct the checks for the states, as specified in the measure. Advocates have protested, and are preparing to bring a lawsuit this month if no further action is taken.To build a list of possible policies, we consulted the academic literature on laws from American states and foreign countries and spoke with advocates for gun rights and gun control. Both surveys were conducted in June 2016.For our effectiveness survey, we asked experts in gun policy to evaluate each idea on a scale of 1 to 10, according to how effective they thought it would be in reducing fatalities. We asked the experts to ignore considerations of political or legal feasibility.Our expert panel consisted of 32 current or retired academics in criminology, public health and law, who have published extensively in peer-reviewed academic journals on gun policy. We know our sample is small and may not include every expert that readers would like consulted. But we feel it represents a useful, if imperfect, measure of what people steeped in the research think might save lives.The panel of academics included: Cathy Barber, Magdalena Cerd\u00e1, Jay Corzine, John Donohue, Laura Dugan, Liza H.

{"Headline": "Banning \u2018Bump Stocks\u2019 Won\u2019t Solve Anything", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Congress and even the National Rifle Association seem on the verge of a breakthrough: regulating the so-called bump stocks used in that killing spree, aftermarket devices that effectively turn legal, semiautomatic rifles into deadly, automatic weapons of war.Whenever the N.R.A. embraces a gun-control measure, it\u2019s worth looking further under the hood. And, in fact, a ban on bump stocks falls into the same trap as so many previous attempts at \u201csensible\u201d gun control have \u2014 it treats a symptom, but not the disease. As with the assault-weapons ban, it\u2019s not how the gun looks that matters; it\u2019s how it works.While the Las Vegas massacre was remarkable for its spree of fire, it fit a pattern: Many mass shootings involve rifles designed for automatic fire for the military, the design of which has then been modified to operate as legal, semiautomatic weapons for the civilian market \u2014 the AR-15, related to the military\u2019s M-16, being the most famous, but not the only, example.Civilian ownership of machine guns, which fire continuously as long as the trigger is pulled, has been restricted in the United States since 1934. But their semiautomatic equivalents, which fire just once with each pull of the trigger but to a casual observer look no different from the military versions, have become wildly popular. At my local gun store Thursday, there were as many semiautomatic, military-style weapons as anything; indeed, more than traditional deer-hunting guns shaped from steel and walnut. A beautiful Brazilian over-and-under shotgun-rifle combination sat in a corner, underpriced and apparently unloved. (I personally don\u2019t understand it; having been issued an M-16 by Uncle Sam in the summer of 1983, I cannot think of another firearm I\u2019d less like to lug into the woods on the first day of hunting season.)But again, aesthetics don\u2019t matter. And while most gun owners might be happy with keeping their rifles as semiautomatic, the proliferation of modification kits, books and YouTube videos demonstrates that many are eager to effectively convert them to automatics. Bump stocks are just the cheapest, simplest way to make a semiautomatic rifle act like an automatic.Open up, say, a Winchester 94, a .30-30 rifle \u2014 a so-called lever-action rifle, popular with deer hunters \u2014 and you\u2019ll find about six mostly flat, stamped metal parts held together with springs and pins. Open up an M-16 or its AR-15 civilian cousin and you\u2019ll find something else entirely: a tubular metal bolt, which slides back with the expulsion of gas as the bullet goes off, allowing the spring-fed magazine beneath to pop another round in place behind the chamber; the returning bolt then pushes it into place.The only real difference between the military and civilian versions is that the M-16 bolt is longer, and the stamped-metal components lock when set to automatic fire, allowing it to fire scores of bullets in several seconds. (Some claim the M-16 can fire up to 700 rounds a minute, but that\u2019s true only in theory; in practice, the rate is limited by magazine size, among other things.)Or take the hottest new rifle, the HK416, originally designed for the German military. A semiautomatic version of the original, the MR556, is available to civilians for a cool $2,800 and up. I know someone who spent $10,000 on two of them. To sell to civilians, the manufacturer, Heckler & Koch, made fairly minor modifications. Its receiver \u2014 where bullet, trigger, bolt and barrel meet \u2014 is the same as the military version\u2019s. But the trigger mechanisms inside, known as the trigger group, are attached differently in the civilian version, and a U-shaped metal ledge is removed.True, a good gunsmith will tell you that while it can be done, converting a semi-automatic military-origin rifle to an automatic isn\u2019t necessarily easy. The main obstacle is that you have to make a number of parts at home, and if you don\u2019t mill them correctly, they can break under the intense heat and pressure of automatic fire. But it\u2019s not impossible, and not surprisingly, the sort of gun owners attracted to these sorts of weapons are often the ones with the patience and machine-shop prowess to give it a go.The only solution, it seems, is to extend the ban on automatic weapons to include gas-powered, semiautomatic rifles that are merely modified versions of their military analogues. Semiautomatic pistols, which don\u2019t meet that criteria and are hard to convert, would be unaffected, as would shotguns, bolt-action rifles and lever-action rifles. But after Las Vegas, we can\u2019t close our eyes to the ease with which someone can unleash automatic weapon fire on a crowd of people. Nor can we pretend that banning just one conversion technique will solve the problem.Richard Parker is the author of \u201cLone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

BlackRock is the beneficiary of a global rush by investors to place their money in so-called passive investments, rather than the traditional actively managed mutual funds.The influx of money \u2014 along with soaring financial markets \u2014 helped boost Blackrock\u2019s profits for the third quarter, which were up 13 percent.Of the $96 billion in new money that BlackRock brought in during the third quarter, most of it, $52 billion, came into its exchange-traded funds business, which operates under the brand iShares.BlackRock, along with its chief competitor, Vanguard, has been at the forefront of the recent boom in passive investing, cashing in on investor frustration with mutual funds, which charge higher fees and, of late, have not performed on par with stock market indexes.Together, these two investment giants now oversee more than $10 trillion in assets.Exchange-traded funds track all the broad stock and bond market indexes as well as a wide range of investment strategies, some of which are designed to replicate the approaches of portfolio managers picking value or growth stocks.BlackRock now oversees $1.6 trillion in E.T.F.s, by far the most in the industry, and its leadership has made it clear that these types of investment funds represent the future for BlackRock. And the results this quarter reveal why: funds with active strategies took in $5.7 billion while passive offerings attracted $70 billion.In an interview, BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, said that he was not worried about regulators\u2019 concerns that stock markets are getting too frothy.At a news conference on Wednesday, top officials at the International Monetary Fund warned bluntly about rising asset prices and investors pushing aggressively into high-risk, high-return stocks and bonds.Mr. Fink highlighted uniform global growth, political stability in Germany and France and the prospect of stronger earnings this quarter as solid reasons for investor optimism.He also cited a growing willingness by global investors to tune out political controversy, be it concerns about Catalonian independence from Spain or the latest tweet from President Trump.\u201cThe world is more resilient than it has been in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Fink said. \u201cPolitically, people may be frightened but economically they are feeling much better.\u201dThird Point, a hedge fund known for taking large stakes in companies and then pushing for change to boost returns, took a position in BlackRock last August.

P. & G. can make that happen only by bringing all three to its side. Vanguard, with 181 million shares, is the largest. State Street owns 115 million and BlackRock 156 million, according to ISS. To put it another way, Mr. Peltz has to win just one of the three. Though that sounds like a tall order for P. & G., past voting records give it a chance.

Wayfair Is Counting on It", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly on a fall morning, the sweat was already beading on Sean Williams\u2019s brow as he and his partner wrestled with a problem worthy of a geometry class: figuring out the series of lifts, tilts and tugs needed to squeeze a sectional sofa through the front door of a New Jersey home.Just a few days earlier, Jeanne Korchak had found the perfect L-shaped sectional for her Fair Haven home from a website run by the online home furnishings giant Wayfair. Now it was up to Mr. Williams to flawlessly deliver and assemble the sectional. A single rip or ding and Wayfair would wind up taking the furniture back.After Mr. Williams declared he was done, Mrs. Korchak stepped into the room, her eyes zeroing in on a beige sofa cushion. \u201cIs that a stain?\u201d she asked. The room fell silent.These days, ordering a shirt or a pair of shoes online and having them delivered to your home is easy. And while online grocery delivery may occasionally result in a broken egg or melted ice cream, it\u2019s hardly the end of the world.But ordering big, expensive furniture \u2014 a sofa, dining room table or mattress \u2014 online is a more complex challenge. Is that chair more teal or more turquoise? It\u2019s hard to tell through the pixels. Do the cushions feel like you\u2019re sitting on a cloud or on a boulder?And that\u2019s before the demanding task of delivery. Oversize couches meet small door frames. Fragile crystal chandeliers meet floors. Vanities are the bane of all deliverymen, managing to be both bulky, weighing hundreds of pounds, and delicate, with easily scratched or nicked tops.This is the knotty space that Wayfair is trying to own.This year, Boston-based Wayfair will sell around $4 billion worth of ceiling fans, dog beds, espresso machines, hot tubs and artificial Christmas trees (around 55,000 sold in the last 12 months) online. That\u2019s nearly double what it sold two years ago and just a little less than the home furnishings giant Williams-Sonoma, which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm.It\u2019s a growth story that has proved irresistible to Wall Street; Wayfair\u2019s stock price has more than doubled this year, to $71.But the big question hovering over Wayfair is whether the company can ever make money by delivering bulk furniture virtually for free. The company is expected to lose nearly $200 million this year and has been a favorite of short sellers, betting that the company\u2019s stock price will fall.Most major furniture retailers will charge at least $130 to deliver a couch. But Wayfair will ship or deliver any purchases costing $49 or more for free, bringing large pieces of furniture into the entrance of your home. (Taking the item to a specific room or assembling it costs extra.) And if the order is damaged or if the customer simply doesn\u2019t like the color, Wayfair says, it will take the item back.Noting that Wayfair\u2019s profit margins are considerably less than those of its competitors and that Amazon has signaled its interest in the space, some analysts argue that it may be difficult for Wayfair to produce profits. There has also been speculation in the industry that Amazon or Walmart could acquire Wayfair.\u201cIt feels like 1999,\u201d said Andrew Left, the executive editor of Citron Research, who has bet that Wayfair\u2019s stock will fall. That was when the stocks of dot-coms and e-commerce firms soared, even though the vast majority were unprofitable.Wayfair argues that the margins of its competitors, like Restoration Hardware or Williams-Sonoma, are higher because they are building extra profit into their pricing. A sofa from another company may start at $1,000, but Wayfair sells its sofas at an average price of $600, a spokeswoman said.Wayfair also noted that its earnings in the United States before taxes and other expenses had been positive this year, and said its net losses were due to its investments in its international businesses.Wayfair was founded by Niraj Shah and Steve Conine, friends and engineers who graduated from Cornell University in 1995. Within three years, the pair had sold their first company, an information technology consulting business, for $10 million.But in 2002, as dot-coms collapsed, the two men noticed that small, specialized online retailers were still growing at a rapid clip.\u201cOne lady had a website selling birdhouses that she stored in the garage,\u201d Mr. Shah said in an interview. \u201cShe was looking to sell her business because she couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand.\u201dSo the two men started racksandstands.com, a website selling, well, stands and racks for televisions. In its first four months, the site amassed $400,000 in sales.By 2010, the company was an incongruous collection of 270 websites, from cookware.com to everygrandfatherclock.com to outdoorrugs.com. So Mr. Shah and Mr. Conine consolidated the sites under one digital umbrella, and ultimately called it Wayfair.Today, sitting under that umbrella is a dizzying array of more than eight million products. The company offers 7,328 types of coffee tables, 106,430 different area rugs (20,073 of them blue) and 759 different standing coat racks.To help customers wade through its virtual bazaar, Wayfair has some of its 1,000 software engineers constantly developing new features for its app. One allows consumers to snap a photo of an item, a couch or chair, that Wayfair then matches with products on its website. Another recently released feature produces a 3-D image of the Wayfair product, allowing consumers to see how a piece looks in a room and, perhaps more important, whether it will fit the room\u2019s dimensions.But many traditional retailers argue that furniture remains a category where consumers will be reluctant to buy solely online.\u201cHaving a real-world presence, we believe, is a competitive advantage,\u201d said Marta Benson, the president of Pottery Barn.While about half of the revenues for Williams-Sonoma come from online sales, Ms. Benson noted that plenty of customers \u201cwant to sit, touch and feel some categories before they purchase.\u201dStill, investors have rewarded Wayfair\u2019s explosive growth since the company went public in 2014. With its soaring share price, Wayfair has a market capitalization of $6.2 billion. That\u2019s $2 billion more than Williams-Sonoma\u2019s valuation.But a big difference is that Williams-Sonoma is profitable, making $300 million last year.In an effort to bring down some of its costs, Wayfair has spent much of the past year changing its shipping and delivery models.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing it in-house,\u201d said Sharif Sleiman, Wayfair\u2019s head of supply chain and operations as he strolled through one of two new warehouses that Wayfair has built just outside Princeton, N.J.The combined warehouses \u2014 the size of 17 football fields, with racks that stretch 40 feet to the ceiling \u2014 hold some of Wayfair\u2019s most popular smaller household items and furniture, from scrub brushes to lamps, that can be shipped throughout the Northeast on United Parcel Service or FedEx trucks.\u201cWe\u2019re able to deliver faster, within one or two days,\u201d Mr. Sleiman said, \u201cand we\u2019re seeing less damage.\u201dBut delivering the bigger pieces of furniture is much trickier. A year ago, all of the \u201clast mile\u201d warehouse facilities were run by third parties. But concerns about inconsistent customer service and damaged tables and beds prompted Wayfair to take over half of the facilities, trying to infuse a sense of teamwork and enthusiasm among its workers.\u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d shouted a group of two dozen deliverymen standing in a Wayfair warehouse in Linden, N.J., about 10 miles south of Newark, at 4:38 on a recent morning.\u201cLouder,\u201d the team leader demanded.A few minutes later, the group broke up, allowing Sean Williams and the other drivers to check their deliveries and routes for the day.Mr. Williams and the others are employed by a third-party freight delivery firm, but Wayfair puts the drivers through extensive customer training, shows them how to handle fragile items and gives them bonuses for good customer feedback.Mr. Williams\u2019s first delivery that morning \u2014 dropping off and assembling a cocktail table \u2014 went smoothly. But in Fair Haven, he hit a snag with the sectional sofa.On this day, at least, Wayfair escaped the fate of returned furniture. A few dabs with a baby wipe and the mark on the cushion disappeared.Mrs. Korchak declared that she was pleased with her purchase, and, about 30 minutes after he had arrived, Mr. Williams pulled the truck out, headed for his next delivery.Advertisement"}
