{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s C.E.O. and More at the DealBook Conference: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We\u2019re following how the health care industry plans to fight back against President Trump\u2019s move to undercut the Affordable Care Act. More on that in a moment.This morning, we\u2019re announcing the speaker lineup for our sixth annual conference.Andrew will host a series of conversations throughout the day with some of the biggest newsmakers at the intersection of business and policy.Among them:A rare public interview with one of the most influential women in the worlds of business and philanthropy, whose organization invests in businesses like The Atlantic and the Washington Wizards and in causes like immigration and education.Also: Will the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback be able to prove that the N.F.L.\u2019s owners have banded together to prevent him from playing?From the filing:Respondents N.F.L. and N.F.L. Team Owners have colluded to deprive Mr. Kaepernick of employment rights in retaliation for Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s leadership and advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equality in the United States.\u201cAnybody that thinks that there\u2019s been any conversations going on among teams about Colin Kaepernick is crazy.\u201dLegal experts call such cases difficult to prove. Under the [collective bargaining agreement], the mere fact that a player is unsigned does not constitute evidence of collusion.Why this matters\u2022 Mr. Kapernick\u2019s protest during the national anthem set off President Trump\u2019s attacks against the league, pitting players against owners and drawing sponsors into the fray.\u2022 If N.F.L. owners had hoped for a swift end to the controversy, they\u2019re probably disappointed.The answer:And Steve Bannon went on record to say that the White House move was meant to destroy the Obama health care plan.Bannon said Trump\u2019s decision to not continue funding Obamacare subsidies, announced Thursday, was designed to \u201cblow up\u201d the health care law and insurance marketplaces.\u201cGonna blow those exchanges up, right?\u201d Bannon said.Terminating this critical program will do just the opposite. This action will make it harder for patients to access the care they need. Costs will go up and choices will be restricted.The insurers may have backing from Republican politicians who protested the move.But the biggest opposition may come from some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own base.The bottom lineWill a coalition of insurers, politicians and voters overturn what Mr. Trump has started?\u2022 The Senate is scheduled to vote tomorrow on starting debate on the 2018 fiscal year budget.What happens when perhaps the most hotly anticipated initial public offering doesn\u2019t take place?Reports now say that Aramco probably would list on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul exchange next year. But the company may pursue a private placement with investors from China and others instead of listing abroad.Who could take a hit?What to watch forWhether Saudi officials will say anything at the their government\u2019s Future Investment Initiative conference later this month. (Andrew will attend.)Pundit cornerIf Weinstein Co. were bought whole and continued to operate, suitors might include hedge funds looking to have a U.S. entertainment asset, a person close to the company said.Another possibility is that Weinstein Co. would be shut down and its library of movies and TV shows and other assets sold in pieces.\u201cI know they\u2019re saying, \u2018Shut this company down.\u2019 Well, they didn\u2019t shut Fox News down, they didn\u2019t shut NBC down. My brother is the one that should pay with everything.He also told the publication that the Weinstein Company wasn\u2019t for sale and that its lenders \u201cgave their support.\u201dBut is that enough?Content partners like Apple, CBS, Amazon, and the writer-actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, already have ended, or want to end, projects with the studio.In other Weinstein newsThe publisher of Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer set Wall Street abuzz this month when he questioned how Bridgewater worked.\u201cBridgewater is a secretive and eccentric firm and I let my suspicions of that get in the way of our ordinarily comprehensive due diligence.\u201dBut don\u2019t think that Mr. Grant has become a booster of Ray Dalio\u2019s firm. He still thinks the hedge fund will be a \u201cfigurehead of the next crisis\u201d:\u201cI think the nature of its trading will present a difficulty in the next downturn, if that downturn, especially, is characterized by an unscripted rise in interest rates.\u201dAmEx, with a market cap of $82.1 billion, trades at 15 times forward earnings.

{"Headline": "The Art of Destroying an Artwork", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe decision came after intense protests, but it also set off its own debate. Critics called it censorship, and worried that advocacy groups \u2014 in this case, animal rights organizations \u2014 now had veto power over art and its public display.But there\u2019s a problem with this binary formulation, which opposes the sacrosanct art object to the interests and demands of the public. Curators need to think about more creative ways to withdraw art from public display. Rather than thinking of calls to remove art as either right or wrong, institutions should think of them as creative opportunities to reimagine who their public is.But in some ways, even though the two institutions\u2019 responses were different, they also had more in common than you\u2019d think. The Guggenheim acquiesced, positioning itself along the way as a victim of censorship; the Whitney refused, and sought to soften this refusal with programs and texts. In both cases, the museums reinforced a debate about an artwork that only makes room for one question: Should it stay or should it go?What we should be asking, instead, is how it should \u201cgo.\u201d A work of art could be destroyed (burned, buried, shredded), edited, documented, mourned or even substituted. It could be supplemented with performances, talks, protests. It could be turned into minimalist furniture for the museum cafe, or sold on eBay, with the proceeds going to charity.Contemporary art theory has long held that the artwork takes place not in the moment of creation or exhibition, but rather in the ways that it circulates in the world. That\u2019s why withdrawal isn\u2019t just a negative act. The museum is actively putting the withdrawal into the world, which will then circulate beside and on top of the artwork, as a rumor, a footnote, a filter. I am arguing for a creative acceptance of the pressure to withdraw an artwork, rather than either outright rejection or reluctant acquiescence.For a different example, look to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. In the spring the museum erected an outdoor sculpture by the artist Sam Durant that replicated the gallows where 38 Dakota people were executed in 1862.Was that \u201ccensorship\u201d? The work was removed, but in a creative way that arguably added more meaning to the work than it ever would have had it remained standing.In some ways, the emptying out of \u201cTheater of the World\u201d also made it more meaningful. Huang Yong Ping, the Paris-based Chinese provocateur behind that work, has frequently been censored. His work \u201cBat Project II,\u201d a reproduction of part of an American spy plane that crashed into a Chinese fighter, was withdrawn from the 2002 Guangzhou Triennial. The depression that the artwork left in the ground remained, however, as a haunting trace of the original work. Whether intentional or not, this sort of lasting reminder of a work should be an inspiration for how museums can handle controversial works: removal, but not erasure.For another example, look to how artists responded to the Whitney Biennial. Parker Bright occupied the space in front of the Till painting on several days with text written across his shirt: \u201cNo lynch mob\u201d and \u201cBlack death spectacle.\u201d His intervention confronted viewers with the reality of a physical body, not just an abstraction of one.A banner that Pastiche Lumumba hung from the High Line, which runs alongside the Whitney, drew attention to the way that history is not yet past: \u201cThe white woman whose lies got Emmett Till lynched is still alive in 2017. Feel old yet?\u201d For observers like myself, this performance was more compelling than the original painting.Social media has changed how we communicate, and social inequity continues to differentiate how we feel. These dynamics are changing the way we curate. For one thing, the work of exhibition-making no longer ends when the show opens. Instead, it continues as a process of listening, a public performance that goes on for months.The \u201cshould it stay or should it go\u201d approach fumbles the opportunity to broaden and enrich what that \u201cus\u201d is. It\u2019s a difficult question, and we will not agree, but even asking it together creates a kind of community. It falls to curators to facilitate this conversation. Institutions, following the lead of artists, should respond creatively to the call for censorship. Perhaps the withdrawal of the artwork can make room for something else to come into view: a new public.David Xu Borgonjon is a curator and writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At 100, Thelonious Monk Gets a Hero\u2019s Celebration", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookOn the final two nights of a 10-day festival here celebrating Monk\u2019s 100th birthday, two of today\u2019s great tenor saxophonists put their hands on his music. From very different angles, they showed what makes him jazz\u2019s most popular composer to cover, and one of its most difficult.The context was the same for Joshua Redman on Wednesday as it was for Ravi Coltrane on Thursday: They were backed by a standard jazz trio led by the pianist Ethan Iverson as they played tight renditions of classic Monk repertoire. But while Mr. Redman soloed with a smokestack effusiveness, getting underneath the melodies and setting them alight, Mr. Coltrane\u2019s horn was liquid. It seemed to move freely on its own, as if any expansion or turn was coming directly from the notes themselves.The major focus, perhaps inevitably, was on Monk\u2019s pen. The 60-plus tunes he is known to have written are some of the most beloved pieces in jazz\u2019s canon, partly because they live just barely outside of its conventional language. That\u2019s what the daytime show on Oct. 21 was about, when five pianists took turns playing solo and duo renditions of almost every work Monk wrote. The same applied for the performances of the J.D. Allen Trio, which worked with a different guest each of the festival\u2019s first three nights.This set was one of the moments when the spirit of Monk\u2019s piano playing got called up and shocked back to life in the air of the present day. This came naturally through Mr. Moran\u2019s fingers and his memory. He grew up idolizing Monk and reworked Monk\u2019s language of halting gestures and piquant dissonance, eventually rendering his own approach. Playing with Mr. Sorey here, he often reduced Monk\u2019s song themes to scaffolds and wisps; his own chiming, splintery swing feels attested to Monk\u2019s long shadow, even in a context dominated by free improvisation.\u201cI didn\u2019t learn what the normal way is to do things: Monk is my normal way to do things,\u201d Mr. Moran said after the festival, describing his formative years. \u201cWhen that\u2019s the bar that you pull against, you already know certain things about how the body works with the piano, how important dance is to a song, how great swing feels at a medium tempo if you\u2019re doing it right.\u201dRather than dashing futurism, his bebop was about arrangement and choreography. Each note in his compositions sounds like a weight-bearing limb, supporting the body of the song and leading into the next movement. And those limbs often pause to hold a pose: On a simple, singsong piece like \u201cRhythm-a-Ning\u201d or a wound-up work like \u201cCriss Cross,\u201d he uses silence more than speed.\u201cThere are few artists that everyone would have such a uniform agreement on: \u2018Yes, let\u2019s check out this repertoire,\u2019\u201d Mr. Iverson said in an interview Thursday. \u201cEveryone that has come down to do this festival has been like, \u2018Oh yeah, I\u2019d like to study some Monk.\u2019 Everybody is excited and sometimes a little daunted by trying to play the songs right, trying to have a personal opinion.\u201dA hundred years after Monk\u2019s birth, on Oct. 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, N.C., roughly 60 miles east of Durham, we\u2019re deep into something like the post-history of jazz \u2014 at least as a definable style and a set of universal touchstones. New ensembles rarely spend much time on standard repertoire, and most mainline jazz is growing from the conservatory and the composer\u2019s mind, not the fertile space of jam sessions. (Monk first developed a following as the house pianist at Minton\u2019s, the Harlem club whose jam sessions in the \u201940s incubated bebop.) To be an improvising musician nowadays almost always means writing your own textbook, often with source material from outside the blues and jazz tradition.At Durham Fruit and Produce Company, an old warehouse that has recently been retrofitted as a small performing arts venue, sculptural work by the North Carolina-based artist Andr\u00e9 Leon Gray was installed throughout the building: near the entrance, an altar with accouterments to Monk; down the hall, an image of the pianist\u2019s silhouette inscribed with his catchphrase, \u201cAlways know;\u201d onstage, a tar painting of Monk\u2019s face, surrounded by black and white keys arranged in a loose asymmetry.And in the lobby, just beside the makeshift bar, there was a listening station with some turntables set up. Vinyl copies of Monk\u2019s full discography were available for attendees to spin. The afternoon before the festival\u2019s final show, when Mr. Coltrane performed with Mr. Iverson\u2019s trio, I sat down and cued up \u201cMonk\u2019s Music,\u201d the classic septet recording from 1957. (A young John Coltrane, Ravi\u2019s father, appears on the album.)The festival\u2019s live proceedings seemed to defend jazz\u2019s old idea that the onstage ritual can encompass both veneration and invention. And then there was the listening station: a reminder that the old texts remain. In a time of postmodern splay, Monk is here to stay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better Way to Trace Scattered Refugees", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesThe cellphone in Masomo\u2019s bedroom in Ottawa, Canada, rang at 6:30 a.m. on May 26. Usually he turns his phone off at night, but the night before he had forgotten \u2014 fortunately.He heard a voice in French. \u201cI\u2019m calling from Nairobi,\u201d a man said, then asked Masomo his name, his village and whether he had family members he has not heard from for years. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve found your brother,\u201d the man said. \u201cShall we patch him though?\u201d Masomo, who works at a university, had been searching for Ishara for almost a decade. (He asked that I do not identify him or his brother, so these are childhood names.)Masomo had moved to Ottawa in 2005 at the invitation of a relative, leaving his natal village in the Kivu region of Democratic Republic of Congo, where civilians have been under siege from armies, militias and warlords for decades.His family was prominent, and therefore a frequent target. \u201cYou are emotionally numb and in survival mode all the time,\u201d said Masomo. \u201cEvery time you hear a bullet, you try to figure out which direction it\u2019s coming from and run the opposite way. We spent many nights in the bush under the trees.\u201dIn 2009, one of Masomo\u2019s brothers and a cousin were killed, and the family fled. From Ottawa, Masomo lost contact. There were no phones in the village, so he called people he knew in a nearby city, and contacted the Red Cross. No one knew where his family had gone.Most United Nations agencies rely for family tracing on the International Committee of the Red Cross, the global network of national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. Florence Anselmo, who directs the I.C.R.C.\u2019s Central Tracing Agency, said that the I.C.R.C. and United Nations agencies can\u2019t look in one another\u2019s databases. That\u2019s necessary for privacy reasons, but it\u2019s an obstacle to family tracing.The organization is working on developing an algorithm for matching, but for now, the search engines are human. \u201cWhen we talk about tracing, it\u2019s not only about data matching,\u201d Anselmo said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole part about accompanying families: the human aspect, professionals as well as volunteers who are able to look for people \u2014 even go house to house if needed.\u201dThis is the mom-and-pop general store model of tracing: The customer makes a request at the counter, then a shopkeeper with knowledge of her goods and a kind smile goes to the back and brings it out, throwing in a lollipop. But the world has 65 million forcibly displaced people, a record number. Personalized help to choose from limited stock is appropriate in many cases. But it cannot possibly be enough.Refunite seeks to become the eBay of family tracing. In 2005, Christopher and David Mikkelsen helped a friend, an Afghani refugee in Copenhagen named Mansour, look for his family. The Mikkelsens eventually found one of his brothers in southern Russia, and helped Mansour and the brother to meet. \u201cThe agency in Denmark literally did not know what its counterparts in Sweden or Australia had,\u201d said Christopher. \u201cThis was absurd.\u201dChristopher was a musician and writer, and David was a documentary filmmaker. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about refugees, or about technology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we thought: People scatter globally. We need a global solution. Just create a simple Excel spreadsheet and share it internationally! How hard can this be?\u201dPretty hard, apparently. During 2006 and 2007, the brothers took their idea to international agencies and refugee aid groups all over the world. No one bit.So they did it themselves, finding an enthusiastic response from corporations and their foundations. \u201cWe went from being laughed out of every office in this field to having access at every single C.E.O.\u2019s office in every company we approached,\u201d said Christopher. SAP, a global software company, built Refunite\u2019s first management system, and Ericsson built its first mobile platform. FedEx donates shipping, the H & M foundation is sponsoring a pilot of interactive voice response in Pakistan, and S.A.S., the Scandinavian airline, donates flights.Now United Nations organizations and refugee groups work with Refunite. The International Rescue Committee was Refunite\u2019s partner for its first work in South Sudan. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees facilitates Refunite\u2019s outreach in camps and refers family tracing cases; Refunite, in turn, sends people who need protection to the U.N.H.C.R.Because so much is done free of cost by partners, Refunite can be the world\u2019s largest missing persons platform and still be tiny; it has a staff of 25 and an annual budget of $2 million.In addition to the basics, registrants can add personal information they believe will help family members identify them \u2014 a childhood nickname, for example. The algorithm identifies potential matches. The searcher can then contact a possible match through the Refunite platform.Mikkelsen said that so far, 750,000 people have registered. Countries with the most users are Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan and Iraq.That\u2019s a tiny percentage of the world\u2019s displaced and their families, and Refunite\u2019s numbers reflect this; Mikkelsen said there have been about 6,000 reconnections so far.What about that ultimate search machine, Facebook? Well, Facebook is only for people who can read, have smartphones and can afford data. In some countries, that\u2019s most people \u2014 Syrians, for example, are typically educated and middle class, and indeed, few of them use Refunite.\u201cI think about a woman, 55 years old, three children, semiliterate, who flees from Somalia to Kenya,\u201d said Mikkelsen. \u201cIf I can serve her needs, we\u2019re in position to capture the full arc.\u201dIt\u2019s not easy. People can use Refunite\u2019s web platform in 12 languages and its text service in five. But refugees speak hundreds. It\u2019s relatively simple to create text service in a new language. It\u2019s very difficult to create interactive voice response, because machines need to learn from lots of material.Then there are challenges with names. There are many, many Abdi Mohameds in Somalia, for example. And cultural practices vary. Mikkelsen talked about one young man who had trouble filling in his mother\u2019s name. A mother, in his parlance, was a woman who helped raise him. \u201cI have five mothers,\u201d he said.The biggest challenge is getting the word out. Radio stations serving refugee camps or large groups of displaced people are crucial. Mobile operators like Safaricom in Kenya blast out millions of text messages in local languages about Refunite. Then word-of-mouth \u2014 the best advertising \u2014 kicks in. At the start of one text blast campaign, 80 percent of people calling the text center had heard about Refunite through a text. Three months later, 80 percent had heard about Refunite through word-of-mouth.\u201cMy brother had grown into an older man after that long,\u201d Masomo said. \u201cBut of course I could recognize the voice.\u201dAfter effusive greetings, the brothers talked about their parents (who were well) and other family members, who had landed with Ishara in a refugee camp in Uganda. They exchanged mobile numbers. In all, they talked for 15 minutes.Refunite\u2019s work is done with the first phone call; the organization doesn\u2019t facilitate in-person reunions. Masamo and Ishara have called each other many times since the first call.Then in August, Masomo flew to Uganda. There was joy in seeing his family. \u201cBut we mourned together people we had lost,\u201d he said. And while he lives a stable life in Canada, his family in Uganda left all they had behind, and in the refugee camp there are few ways to make a living. Health care is also hard to get, he said.It was painful for him to see. \u201cI am trying to find information to help them resettle,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many obstacles. It is more difficult than I had thought.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Amazon Book Battle", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook News\u201cI want to beat them,\u201d said Mark Rubbo, Readings\u2019 co-owner, discussing Amazon as he stared across Lygon Street to where Borders used to be. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of this monolith devouring everything.\u201dBut changing Australians\u2019 reading habits may be more of a challenge. Books are bellwethers of great symbolic weight, not just because they were Amazon\u2019s first product and because the company often uses them to wedge itself into new markets, but also because books and bookstores are tightly linked to Australia\u2019s sense of itself, and to the country\u2019s beloved ecosystem of local commerce.This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school.Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia\u2019s book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States.Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they\u2019ll eventually embrace and come to love.Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon\u2019s arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia\u2019s own writing, and way of life.\u201cOur culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,\u201d Mr. Rubbo said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to defend our voice.\u201dAmazon\u2019s first \u201cfulfillment center\u201d in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products.Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia\u2019s minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom.What comes next is anyone\u2019s guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions.Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn\u2019t explained why it\u2019s taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon\u2019s American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne.Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia\u2019s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers\u2019 hands, in some cases on the same day they\u2019re ordered.\u201cIt\u2019s not about price,\u201d Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, \u201cit\u2019s about the logistics.\u201dBut isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt.For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work.\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people like supporting local businesses.\u201d\u201cI would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,\u201d he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne.But just below his own bookish calm \u2014 and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books \u2014 there are wider concerns.In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged.One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia\u2019s big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers\u2019 orders at the end of the line.The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia\u2019s labor, tax and import laws in its favor.Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected.But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia\u2019s literary culture.The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books.Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation.\u201cWhat makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,\u201d said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: \u201cIt\u2019s a retrograde move.\u201dInside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see.Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent?\u201cWe have a lot of questions,\u201d said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years.He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone.The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia\u2019s well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere.Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. \u201cI like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn\u2019t find otherwise,\u201d said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening.Amazon\u2019s deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price.Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers.

Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment.

Or looking at feminist art that was too shocking for the 1960s and \u201970s. Or walking into the mouth of a Russian-made beast. On purpose.But the main fair, with some 160 contemporary art exhibitions, is more than enough to keep an eager collector happy for days. Here are a few booths worth peeking into and lingering.In real life, some are on loan from museums, some are by world-famous artists (like Louise Bourgeois and Henry Moore), and some were bought on eBay. Part of the premise is what organizers call the \u201cpower of display,\u201d positioning everyday objects as art.Marcel Duchamp always understood that concept; his \u201cBouche-\u00c9vier\u201d (\u201cSink Stopper\u201d) is part of the show. Victoria Siddall, director of Frieze London, in a telephone interview from her office in London, described this presentation as \u201cwildly ambitious\u201d with a real \u201celement of fun\u201d at heart. She added, \u201cI think they may even have a museum gift shop.\u201dHis newest series is Negatives, and his latest work, \u201cneg lapresmidi,\u201d will have its first public showing at Frieze. Its subject: The dance genius Vaslav Nijinsky and his ballet \u201cL\u2019Apr\u00e8s-Midi d\u2019un Faune,\u201d which shocked Paris in 1912 with its amorous goat-man deity and all those woodland goddesses.Mr. Ruff, who lives and works in D\u00fcsseldorf, starts with historical sepia photos and does a transfer that results in the look of cyanotypes (early blueprint-like photography).Ms. Tompkins, Renate Bertlmann, Birgit J\u00fcrgenssen, Marilyn Minter and Penny Slinger were chosen, Ms. Siddall said, because their art, when it was made, was considered too \u201cpolitically subversive or sexually explicit\u201d to be included in museum surveys. But their time may have come, as Alison M. Gingeras, the section\u2019s curator, will discuss in a special talk on Oct. 6.Ms. Tompkins\u2019s work could be compared to Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s; a major difference, though, is that some of her pictures are seven feet tall.The fair program casually describes her predominant subject matter as \u201cwhite hairy nude males,\u201d so it should be interesting to see why the five very recent Cheng paintings on display have titles like \u201cBethany Beach\u201d and \u201cInside Jen\u2019s Freezer.\u201d\u201cHuman perception and reality\u201d are her subjects, according to her London gallery, Hales. She does paintings, paper works and mixed media, and her influences include Greek myths, science fiction and modernist industrial design. Sometimes it all comes out in intense colors and textures, like \u201cGreen Space,\u201d her 1974 oil, to be shown here.Another Egyptian artist, Taha Belal, contributes sculptures (using materials like mirrors, cardboard and aluminum foil) that ponder the interface between his two identities: an artist and a young guy who has a day job in an office.Tamara Al Samerraei, who was born in Kuwait and lives in Lebanon, is represented by her large acrylic paintings, which begin with faded snapshots from pretty poolside summers but suggest change ahead.\u201cYou walk through this big, gaping mouth of the figure,\u201d Ms. Siddall said, to find a mix of artwork and viewer participation. The only guarantee is that everyone who plays Lucky Draw, reaching into the acrylic barrel filled with raffle tickets, will come away with a prize.The marble and bronze sculptures that look like trees were created by the Arte Povera veteran Giuseppe Penone. The pool, described as \u201ca pulsating, beating body of water,\u201d is by the Spanish sculptor Cristina Iglesias. Ms. Iglesias created \u201cDeep Fountain\u201d in Antwerp in 2006 and has been exploring the use of water in art ever since.Advertisement"}

That is the sort of story the tech industry loves to tell about itself: It is bringing freedom, enlightenment and a better future for all mankind.Their amount of concentrated authority resembles the divine right of kings, and is sparking a backlash that is still gathering force.\u201cFor 10 years, the arguments in tech were about which chief executive was more like Jesus. Which one was going to run for president. Who did the best job convincing the work force to lean in,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cNow sentiments are shifting. The worm has turned.\u201dUnderlying the meet-and-greets is the reality that the internet long ago became a business, which means the companies\u2019 first imperative is to do right by their stockholders.\u201cFor all the lip service that Silicon Valley has given to changing the world, its ultimate focus has been on what it can monetize,\u201d Mr. Baird said.\u201cThe result?\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery voice is heard. The cacophony more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harassment and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen.\u201dSuch complaints, repeated at regular intervals, did not stop the tech world from seizing the moment. Millions and then billions of people flocked to its services. The chief executives were regarded as sages. Disruption was the highest good.Mr. Rosenstein, a co-founder of Asana, an office productivity start-up, said in an email that he had banned not just Facebook but also the Safari and Chrome browsers, Gmail and other applications.\u201cI realized that I spend a lot of time mindlessly interacting with my phone in ways that aren\u2019t serving me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook is a very powerful tool that I continue to use every day, just with more mindfulness.\u201dIf social media is on the defensive, Mr. Zuckerberg is particularly on the spot \u2014 a rare event in a golden career that has made him, at 33, one of the richest and most influential people on the planet.\u201cWe have a saying: \u2018Move fast and break things,\u2019\u201d he wrote in his 2012 manifesto. \u201cThe idea is that if you never break anything, you\u2019re probably not moving fast enough.\u201dFacebook dropped that motto two years later, but critics say too much of the implicit arrogance has lingered. Mr. Galloway, whose new book, \u201cThe Four,\u201d analyzes the power of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, said the social media network was still fumbling its response.\u201cZuckerberg and Facebook are violating the No. 1 rule of crisis management: Overcorrect for the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir attitude is that anything that damages their profits is impossible for them to do.\u201dJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, said the network was doing its best.\u201cFacebook is an important part of many people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous responsibility \u2014 and one that we take incredibly seriously.\u201dSome social media entrepreneurs acknowledge that they are confronting issues they never imagined as employees of start-ups struggling to survive.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to think through the repercussions of everything we did,\u201d Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, said in an interview shortly before he rejoined the service last spring.He maintained that Twitter was getting an unfair rap: \u201cFor every bad thing, there are a thousand good things.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that sometimes \u201cit gets a little messy.\u201dDespite the swell of criticism, the vast majority of investors, consumers and regulators seem not to have changed their behavior. People still eagerly await the new iPhone. Facebook has more than two billion users. President Trump likes to criticize Amazon on Twitter, but his administration ignored pleas for a rigorous examination of Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods.\u201cThis war, like so many wars, is going to start in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor.For some tech companies, the new power is a heavy weight. Cloudflare, which provides many sites with essential protection from hacking, made its first editorial decision in August: It lifted its protection from The Daily Stormer, basically expunging the neo-Nazi site from the visible web.\u201cIncreasingly tech companies are going to be put into the position of making these sorts of judgments,\u201d said Matthew Prince, Cloudflare\u2019s chief executive.The picture is likely to get even more complicated. Mr. Prince foresees several possible dystopian futures. One is where every search engine has a political point of view, and users gravitate toward the one they feel most comfortable with. That would further balkanize the internet.Another possibility is the opposite extreme: Under the pressure of regulation, all hate speech \u2014 and eventually all dissent \u2014 is filtered out.\u201cPeople are realizing that technology isn\u2019t neutral,\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cI used to travel to Europe to hear these fears.

{"Headline": "Sade\u2019s Quiet Storm of Cool", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "The singer doesn\u2019t have to say a thing to loom over the culture.Supported byNot long ago, a tattoo shop in Brooklyn got a bad review on Yelp. A customer was angry \u2014 not about his new ink, but about the soundtrack that accompanied his trip there.\u201cWhy are you playing Sade,\u201d he wrote, inserting an expletive. This was music he found fit for \u201ca plastic surgeon\u2019s waiting room,\u201d not a cool tattoo parlor.One can sort of understand where he was coming from.But then and now, Sade had an appeal that lifted it far above the slush pile of schlock.The band\u2019s trench-coat-favoring Nigerian-born frontwoman, Helen Adu, known to the world just as Sade, is more responsible for the popularizing of gold hoop earrings than an entire industry of jewelry executives. She did not so much wear polka dots as single-handedly rescue them from the dustbin of Upper West Side frumpiness.As a generation turned, house D.J.s turned remixes of Sade ballads into club classics, and a raft of hip-hop artists repeatedly sampled her.So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, \u201cProud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week,\u201d obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the store\u2019s side.\u201cAll that says is your understanding of the world and what\u2019s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,\u201d one wrote.Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu\u2019s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they\u2019d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.Demand for T-shirts from Sade\u2019s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico\u2019s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade\u2019s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. \u201cI\u2019d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don\u2019t understand,\u201d Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.\u201cI used to say to people about Sade, \u2018This isn\u2019t going to impress everyone in the room,\u201d Mr. Matamoros said. \u201cGet an Iron Maiden shirt if that\u2019s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.\u201dNot anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it\u2019s pronounced Shar-day; it\u2019s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade\u2019s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world\u2019s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band\u2019s \u201cLove Deluxe\u201d and \u201cLover\u2019s Rock\u201d albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.\u201cShe was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,\u201d said Susan Blond, a former vice president and publicity director at Epic who now heads an agency where clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.\u201cShe was very young, but she was very sophisticated,\u201d Ms. Blond said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t follow anyone else\u2019s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn\u2019t mind designer clothes, but you\u2019d never ever look at her and say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a Chanel outfit.\u2019 She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.\u201dIn a way, Ms. Adu\u2019s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, \u201cSmooth Operator,\u201d she was lamenting what happens when \u201csentiment is left to chance.\u201dThe saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn\u2019t asking \u2014 as Ms. Jones did \u2014 for a guy to \u201cdrive it in between.\u201dCalling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?\u201dDan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade\u2019s first four albums, said, \u201cThere was grace to everything she did.\u201dAlthough Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn\u2019t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.\u201cShe never enjoyed promotion of any type,\u201d Mr. Beck said. \u201cIt was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, \u2018You\u2019ll hate it but we\u2019ll get it all done and when you\u2019re done you\u2019re done.\u2019 And she laughed, and that\u2019s what we did for the next two albums after that.\u201d(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner\u2019s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade\u2019s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.\u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll do that for you, but I don\u2019t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,\u2019\u201d Mr. Watson said. \u201cI said, \u2018The shoot is for you. You control all the images.\u2019 Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.\u201d Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, \u201cLover\u2019s Rock,\u201d grossed $26 million. The second, for \u201cSoldier of Love,\u201d grossed $50 million.)In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine\u2019s entertainment director, didn\u2019t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. \u201cSade,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never know how someone\u2019s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, \u2018Sade, Oh my God. I love it.\u2019 It felt expensive, cool and timeless.\u201dThere\u2019s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn\u2019t sure.\u201cIt\u2019s always like that with Sade,\u201d he said. \u201cTime will go by and she\u2019ll start working on it. For her, it\u2019s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don\u2019t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.\u201d\u201cWhen we were having our first success with her, I said, \u2018This lady could have a hit album when she\u2019s 90 years old.\u2019 Most artists try too hard,\u201d Mr. Beck said. \u201cAnd consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn\u2019t out there waving their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at you every five minutes. She\u2019s completely unique.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d scene in which Reese Witherspoon\u2019s character hears Sade.

{"Headline": "Vivian Maier, Through a Clearer Lens", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesNo one would find the prospect of posthumous fame more appalling than the photographer Vivian Maier. In life, she fanatically concealed her traces: She liked strong bolts on her doors, fake names (she had at least three in rotation) and what seemed to be a spurious French accent. She rarely discussed or shared her work. Many assumed she was homeless.\u201cI\u2019m sort of a spy,\u201d she\u2019d tell people. \u201cI\u2019m the mystery woman.\u201dShe died in a nursing home in 2009, at 83, slipping away as anonymously as she\u2019d lived. Her story would have ended there \u2014 but she had left riches in her wake.But stories \u2014 like snapshots \u2014 are shaped by people, and for particular purposes. There\u2019s always an angle. A new biography, \u201cVivian Maier: A Photographer\u2019s Life and Afterlife,\u201d by Pamela Bannos, strives to rescue Maier all over again, this time from the men who promulgated the Maier myth and profited off her work; chiefly Maloof, who controlled her copyright for a time. After a legal battle \u2014 \u201cthe Vivian Mire,\u201d one critic called it \u2014 her estate passed into a trust last year, where it will be held for possible heirs and eventually released into the public domain.The book braids together three strands: a brisk, rather generic history of American photography; a biography of Maier; and a withering account of how the artist has been represented since her death. \u201cMy goal was always to recognize and give Maier agency within her own story,\u201d Bannos writes. She tries to dislodge the portrayal of Maier as a mysterious, freakish figure, and to see a person where others have seen mostly pathology: her hoarding and possible paranoia.Bannos makes the case that Maier lived a much larger, more varied life than assumed. This famous recluse once took a five-month trip around the world as well as a subarctic train expedition, both times traveling with just her camera for company. As for her notorious secrecy, it served a purpose, at least in the beginning. Her parents were frantic dissemblers who struggled to conceal scandals of illegitimacy, abandonment and institutionalization. Of course Maier was wary about sharing her personal details, Bannos reasons: Who would hire a nanny with such a sordid family life?Nor should we be so struck that Maier never wanted to show her work to anyone. Sharing comes easily, too easily, to us. Not so for Maier, who told a friend that \u201cif she had not kept her images secret, people would have stolen or misused them\u201d \u2014 how prophetic that now seems. And her compulsive photographing prefigured our own relationship with our phones, Bannos says, our own desire to constantly document our lives.In this way, almost point by point, Bannos refutes how Maier has been marketed. And she looks at how it has benefited Maloof et al. to present Maier as a strange, incapable wraith, how it made them look all the more heroic, and allowed them to cavalierly overlook her absolute unwillingness to show her work publicly.In a strange coincidence, Bannos reports, 21 years after Maier lived on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, where she cared for the dark-haired girl who often appears in her photos, Susan Sontag would move into the penthouse of the very same building and begin the essays in \u201cOn Photography.\u201d \u201cPhotographs alter and enlarge our notions of what is worth looking at and what we have a right to observe,\u201d Sontag wrote in the opening pages of that book. \u201cThey are a grammar and, even more importantly, an ethics of seeing. Finally, the most grandiose result of the photographic enterprise is to give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Diabetes Monitor That Spares the Fingers", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past year and a half I\u2019ve been buying a medical device from Italy that has improved my life immeasurably. It wasn\u2019t easy: I roped in a good friend who had moved to Milan to buy the device and ship it to me because it wasn\u2019t yet available in the States. And it was expensive: over $1,600 a year.But my black-market purchase helps me manage my Type 1 diabetes without the need to draw blood from my callused fingers 10-plus times a day to track my glucose level, a ritual that had been an unpleasant part of my life for decades.The FreeStyle Libre, made by Abbott, is a flash glucose sensor that allows people with diabetes to view our blood sugar every minute of the day without a single finger prick. While there are similar devices on the market \u2014 called continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs \u2014 the Libre is the least invasive one I\u2019ve seen. It takes readings from a sensor under the skin but doesn\u2019t require finger sticks for calibration, and is about the size of a quarter and as thick as two. And it\u2019s helping me keep my diabetes under better control.There have been some challenges: The Milanese UPS store wanted a letter detailing exactly what was in the box. My credit card\u2019s fraud department called (\u201cYes, the charge for $365 from Milan is mine\u201d).The Libre I buy from Italy has a self-adhesive, waterproof white sensor that sticks to my arm for 14 days. It took some trial and error to get used to it. One sensor flipped off from over-aggressive toweling at the gym; another came loose after a backpack strap nicked it. Finally, rather than the spot on my outer arm that the manufacturer recommends, I tried putting the sensor on the inside of my arm, which is where it rests right now. It\u2019s barely noticeable, although occasionally a small child will demand to know what it is.I can see real-time results on a small digital reader (or an Android phone app): an arrow going up, down or level alongside my blood glucose number. The resulting data set \u2014 averages, trends and patterns \u2014 monitors my glucose status 24/7.At first, scanning the Libre to check my results after breakfast, lunch or dinner was like bingeing on my favorite Netflix show. I\u2019d show the readout, a blue line with peaks and valleys, to friends and family: Look how I stayed in the normal range all day!Or the flip side: Look what happened after an intense workout. Even without food in my stomach, my blood sugar often, but not always, rose during exercise, which made planning tricky. The device gives me a window to the impact of cortisol, a stress hormone, which prompts a rush of glucose into my bloodstream.After a year and a half of paying well over $2,000 out of pocket \u2014 six sensors every three months along with shipping fees \u2014 my condition has improved. My hemoglobin A1C now clocks in around 6.3 to 6.5, down from 7.0, and my doctor is thrilled. (An A1C level of 5.7 percent is considered normal in people without diabetes.)Dr. Pratik Choudhary, a senior lecturer and consultant at the diabetes center at King\u2019s College London who previewed the Libre early on, said there are limits to its usefulness. \u201cIt is just not cost effective at current prices,\u201d he said. Dozens of studies have shown that continuous glucose monitoring leads to lower hemoglobin A1C results but for someone with tight control (like me), a half point percent change in A1C is a \u201cminimal improvement to quality of life.\u201dStill, how do we quantify peace of mind?The treasure trove of data I get from the Libre \u2014 days, weeks and months of data \u2014 has made it easier for me to manage my life. Learning that it would be available by prescription at major pharmacies in the States late this year seemed like great news.But the model sold here will have a 10-day sensor, rather than the 14-day sensors used worldwide, along with an extended warm-up time \u2014 12 hours for the F.D.A.-approved version versus one hour for my Italian model. That seems like a step backward. I also don\u2019t know how expensive it will be, or whether my insurance under the increasingly shaky Affordable Care Act will cover it. Until those questions are answered, I may stick with my Milan-to-Manhattan route.Larissa Zimberoff, a freelance writer in New York City, has been living with Type 1 diabetes for over 30 years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Frieze London Matures, Choices Push Boundaries", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn tone and style, they harken back to their unusual origins. \u201cFrieze began as a magazine,\u201d said Victoria Siddall, the director of Frieze Fairs, of the still-published art guide. \u201cWe were founded in the early \u201990s in London to tell people about what was exciting in contemporary art and what was going to be interesting in the future.\u201dThe organizers have tried to impart a thoughtful and envelope-pushing feel that springs from that inception. \u201cThe idea is to make the fairs places for discussion and debate about art, as well as buying and selling art,\u201d Ms. Siddall said. \u201cAnd, we\u2019ve created a slightly different atmosphere, I think.\u201dThat goal has attracted new blood to Frieze London this year \u2014 first-time exhibitors include galleries from Lima, Peru; Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Cape Town and Cairo \u2014 and it is reflected in the way the fair is organized.As is typical, there is a section for the heavy-hitter galleries from around the globe, including Marian Goodman, Metro Pictures and Michael Werner, and also a subsidized section for newer galleries. Focus, for galleries less than 12 years old, may present collectors with some fresh faces among dealers, including Carlos/Ishikawa, Instituto de Visi\u00f3n and Kraupa-Tuskany Zeidler.The nine presentations, all focusing on one artist, will highlight some of the most boundary-pushing feminist art and \u201ccreate a market for artists whose work is probably not the easiest to sell,\u201d Ms. Siddall said. For instance, Galerie Andrea Caratsch of St. Moritz will present work by Betty Tompkins, known for her photo-realistic paintings of intercourse.Ms. Gingeras said that the section evolved out of a book she was writing on the same topic. \u201cA lot of women in my generation were spoiled children of the feminist second wave,\u201d she said. \u201cWe took it for granted.\u201dWhen Frieze contacted her, Ms. Gingeras said her initial response was, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I want to curate something for an art fair,\u201d adding that she had not done such a thing before. \u201cBut I thought, I\u2019ll just pitch what I am working on and wait for a \u2018no.\u2019\u201dWhen the yes came, she attributed it to the commitment on the part of the organizers that \u201cthe commercial aspect can\u2019t override the content.\u201dSomewhat less button-pushing will be the booth of the Los Angeles gallery David Kordansky, showing punchy and graphic paintings and sculptures by Will Boone, including the enamel on bronze sculpture \u201cPrisoner\u201d (2017), depicting hands grasping prison bars.The first prize for the most high-concept booth may go to Hauser & Wirth, with \u201cBronze Age c. 3500 BC \u2013 AD 2017.\u201d All the works on view will be in bronze, but only half will be for sale; a quarter are loans from museums, and the last quarter are items bought on eBay and elsewhere just for the display.Neil Wenman, a senior director of Hauser & Wirth\u2019s London branch, said the idea was to set the booth in a fictional environment simulating a \u201cregional, underfunded museum.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it in a lighthearted way.\u201dHe secured the involvement of Mary Beard, an author and Cambridge professor who made the topic of Rome a best seller with the book \u201cS.P.Q.R.,\u201d getting her to record an acoustiguide and videos. There is even a gift shop.The rationale for going to such lengths was simple. \u201cWe all go to so many art fairs,\u201d Mr. Wenman said. \u201cAnd they tend to bleed into one.\u201d For the practically minded, works by Louise Bourgeois, Jenny Holzer, Paul McCarthy and David Smith will be for sale.A few galleries will be addressing urbanism and the built environment, among them OMR of Mexico City, making its first appearance in the fair. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the waiting list for a couple of years,\u201d said Cristobal Riestra, a partner in Galer\u00eda OMR. \u201cCompetition is fiercer than ever.\u201dOMR\u2019s booth will hold 16 works, including Jose D\u00e1vila\u2019s sculpture \u201cUntitled (Pac Man)\u201d and Pia Camil\u2019s sculpture \u201cTelluride Interior,\u201d both from 2016. \u201cI think there is something urban in all of them \u2014 something that addresses the relationship between nature and the man-made,\u201d Mr. Riestra said.Visitors to Frieze London who are ready to look at art from previous decades and centuries can stroll through Regent\u2019s Park (perhaps taking the long way through Queen Mary\u2019s Gardens) to get to Frieze Masters, next to the London Zoo.Luxembourg & Dayan will show a booth packed full of the playful and strange works by the late Italian artist Enrico Baj, who made, among other works, paintings of furniture partly out of pieces of furniture, creating his own kind of collage. The works on view will include \u201cMontagna\u201d (1958).Just because the art at Frieze Masters is older does not mean that the visitors are. \u201cThis fair is totally different than the Continental fairs \u2014 it\u2019s a younger crowd of people,\u201d said Ulrich Fiedler, whose Berlin gallery specializes in avant-garde design from the early 20th century. He will show 30 pieces from the Bauhaus that he intends to place with buyers from major museums.Galerie Ulrich Fiedler first showed at Frieze Masters last year. \u201cI was surprised at the level of interest,\u201d Mr. Fiedler said of his presentation of the De Stijl movement. \u201cI didn\u2019t have one break.\u201dThe interest among younger visitors fits with the organizers\u2019 conception of the event. \u201cThere are other fairs showing historical art,\u201d Ms. Siddall said, referring to the European Fine Art Fair, La Biennale Paris and other shows. \u201cBut there was a feeling that we could do it differently, and give it a much more contemporary feel and context.\u201dMichael Rosenfeld Gallery of New York will devote its booth to black artists from the United States to coincide with \u201cSoul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power,\u201d on view until Oct. 22 at London\u2019s Tate Modern. Two mixed-media collages will be among the works on view: Romare Bearden\u2019s \u201cGray Interior\u201d (1969) and Betye Saar\u2019s \u201cDr. Damballa Ju Ju\u201d (1989).\u201cAfrican-American art has alway been part of our program,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said. \u201cWe have always wanted to expand the canon of art. I have always just shown artists I loved, and the world has woken up.\u201dAs for the Frieze Masters context, Mr. Rosenfeld echoed many art world insiders. \u201cIt\u2019s a love-hate relationship I have with fairs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have become an important part of our program, and we put as much energy into them as we do to shows in our gallery.\u201dThe Tate Modern tie-in is part of that effort. \u201cIt\u2019s a costly endeavor, to tie to a museum show like this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to sell art. We have to walk that fine line.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "You\u2019ll Wear What They Tell You to Wear", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Way We Shop NowSubscription clothing services should make you feel great. Shouldn\u2019t they? The authors Emily Gould and Rumaan Alam investigate.As so many emotional journeys do, this one began with me expressing disgust on Twitter. In this instance, I was angry about the proliferation of lifestyle-touting subscription clothing services. I\u2019d recently seen ads for Bombfell on the subway (\u201cIf shopping isn\u2019t your bag, you\u2019re going to love our box\u201d) and hit a personal tipping point.Clothing delivery services seem somehow dystopian, and although I was freaked out by them, I didn\u2019t fully understand why. Twitter people rushed to fill me in, as I\u2019d hoped they would. Clothing subscriptions provide a utilitarian uniform for cubicle-bound automatons, people said. They enforce a kind of fascistic conformity, like Mao suits but more cheaply made and less chic. They infantilize us in the same way that meal kit delivery services do: by replacing labor done by someone who might care how we\u2019re fed or what we\u2019re wearing (say, a loving parent) with labor done by workers at the bottom rung of a start-up, or even maybe by an algorithm designed to take key words and turn them into outfits. It sounded so much worse than I\u2019d even imagined, and of course this made me want to find out more. So Rumaan Alam and I decided to make ourselves his \u2019n\u2019 hers guinea pigs in a harrowing experiment: Together, we would try out the experience of several of the most popular subscription services. We would take notes on our experiences and compare them. In doing so, we would learn a truth. Are clothing subscriptions the Soylent of fashion \u2014 or are they maybe just a fun and convenient new way to shop?The deal: Seven days to return before you get charged; average price, $89 an article.RUMAAN: Newfangled clothing subscription services are at heart good old-fashioned businesses, in that they make so many promises that it\u2019s impossible to keep them all. If you have someone at home all day or your UPS driver knows where to hide boxes behind your garage, the promise is convenience. If you live far from any stores or simply don\u2019t have time to shop, the promise is access. If you feel overwhelmed by shopping, the promise is attention. If you feel underwhelmed by shopping, the promise is novelty. If you don\u2019t care about fashion, they\u2019ll care for you; if you do care about fashion, they\u2019ll be your clothes buddy. Like so many entities that pledge to disrupt, the subscription service model exchanges one set of hassles for another, more modern, set of hassles. Spend time with the computer instead of a sales clerk. Visit the post office instead of your local shop.My first subscription was to Bombfell, the ubiquitous Instagram advertiser that sounds like a Roger Moore-era Bond film. The enrollment process emphasizes the user over the clothing; you describe your body type, your general style, and indicate anything you know you have no interest in, like boot-cut jeans or graphic tees. (Check, and check.) I am someone who is interested in fashion, which doesn\u2019t put me outside Bombfell\u2019s target demographic, because what the company sells is something I\u2019m interested in too: ease. I appreciate that the delivery was fast and the customer service attentive. The pricing was not an issue because you pay only if you keep the clothes Bombfell sends you and I returned everything. In my enrollment, I told Bombfell that I was simply too busy to shop, that I had a modern sense of style. They sent me a long sleeve tee, a chambray shirt, a pair of brown pants and a pair of faded black jeans, all perfectly serviceable. This was more like the clothing a mother might choose for an adult son, rather than what I expect from a stylist, even if that\u2019s just a term of art for a customer service representative. Especially galling, I thought, was the long sleeve tee, which Bombfell assured me was a design that was theirs alone. Exclusivity is meant to be alluring, but it\u2019s hard not to reason that per some arrangement, every customer, no matter his style or needs, is going to be sent this particular garment. Part of this site\u2019s appeal is, I think, its prices, but I refuse to pretend that $68 is a fair price for a cotton tee.EMILY: I started with Le Tote because I get served its Instagram ads most often, and because one Twitter dissenter had mentioned finding it useful when starting a new job. It also seemed to be the cheapest and most flexible of all the services; you can wear the clothes for as long as you want and then send them back, which spurs the shipment of a new box, purportedly styled just for you. All the options it showed for outfits you would potentially wear seemed irretrievably wack to me, but Le Tote does allow you to choose what\u2019s in your shipment from a set of options, to which it adds a few \u201cfun\u201d extras. My first Tote contained a striped shirt, a faux suede moto jacket, a pair of leggings with Nike written up the side, and (fun!) a vending-machine-quality ring and a floral scarf. The whole thing cost $147, if I wanted to buy it all, which I did not; $147 seemed expensive, considering the plastic fast-fashion quality of the clothes in it.I was left with one burning question. Is Le Tote a play on words? A \u201clitotes\u201d is a figure of speech that uses deliberately exaggerated understatement to make a point, like \u201cnot bad\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not my first rodeo.\u201d Like \u201cLe Tote clothes aren\u2019t the best I\u2019ve ever worn.\u201d I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not a play on words, actually.The deal: You\u2019re sent five things, you try them, return what you don\u2019t like. Bonus fun: You get 25 percent off if you buy all five.RUMAAN: Stitch Fix is in the business of style more than convenience. You can hear it in the very name, the notion that your wardrobe is something that can be fixed, and that will in turn fix your life. The style questionnaire is more rigorous than Bombfell\u2019s, more granular, and I could imagine my fellow consumers answering those queries mindful of what the right articles of clothing might do for them. That\u2019s part of fashion\u2019s promise, that a girlfriend or boyfriend or a promotion are just one tie or sweater or pair of shoes away. Bombfell emphasizes its personal touch, showing you a head shot of the stylist who\u2019s assisting you. Stitch Fix doesn\u2019t work quite the same way; you\u2019re welcome to send a note to your stylist, but to me it felt like sending a note to an algorithm. Anyway, I requested some blazers. I was sent two, both perfectly serviceable if not quite what I want in a blazer. The trade-off for the convenience of trying something on at home is that you don\u2019t have access to much variety. Presumably, over time, your stylist (or the algorithm) will learn to anticipate your tastes, the way we\u2019re told online advertising works. Of course, when I\u2019m online, I find I see mostly advertisements for things I\u2019ve already bought.My husband tried on one of the blazers and declared that he wanted it. It was only when I pointed out that it was $200 that he noticed that the shoulder didn\u2019t fit quite right, that the cut was not altogether flattering. The deal: You approve your trunk preview, and after it arrives you have five days to return or buy the six to 10 items in a trunk. EMILY: I next tried Trunk Club Women, also based on Twitter recommendation \u2014 this one from a woman who swore that the app\u2019s stylist had heeded her very specific requests and that she\u2019d ended up buying several of the items from her first trunk. Unlike Le Tote, Trunk Club is expensive. You also get to have a chat with a person who is definitely not a bot about your style preferences. I actually loved this process so much. Doubters (like Rumaan!) told me, \u201cWell, you could have that experience at any department store, especially at Nordstrom, which owns Trunk Club.\u201d But the illusory intimacy of digital interaction made me so much more honest with Sophie, the stylist, than I would have ever been with a stranger IRL. Very quickly, she learned about me that I teach undergrad creative writing, that I almost never wear florals or bright colors, that I usually wear boots or sneakers and jeans and a button-front shirt, and that I still have a postpartum gut even though my son is 2\u00bd.I admitted that I was unlikely to ever wear anything bodycon and described my ideal aspirational aesthetic as \u201crich L.A. lesbian.\u201d The results were so shockingly on point that there were two items in my first Trunk preview that I had to delete, not because I didn\u2019t like them, but because I already owned them. The experience of trying all these clothes on at home instead of in a Nordstrom dressing room, however, was not actually that luxurious. I found the box big and daunting, and it sat around unopened for days while I waited to have enough time set aside to do a little in-home fashion show for myself. But five days is all you get with Trunk Club, and once its emails started to take on a slightly chiding tone, I worried that the company would charge my credit card for thousands of dollars worth of clothes. So late one afternoon, I opened the box. I made yes, no and maybe piles, and there was a very cozy cashmere/wool blend long sleeve Vince sweater dress in the maybe pile that seemed like the kind of thing that might be worth its $400 price tag. I was in the process of trying it on a second time when disaster struck. I had been standing on my coffee table to look in my apartment\u2019s only mirror, and without warning the table collapsed underneath me! My first concern, as I assessed the damage, after I determined that I hadn\u2019t sustained anything worse than a big, rapidly purpling butt bruise, was that the scrape on my hand had maybe gotten some blood on the dress. It hadn\u2019t, but the dress seemed somehow tainted anyway. I ended up sending it back. I also sent back a denim pencil skirt, a Bond-villainess scuba dress and a white silk top that had looked a little bit frumpy even on the lissome teenager who modeled it on the website. I kept a soft cropped sweater and a black velvet Eileen Fisher T-shirt that I wore later that week to a dinner to celebrate my 36th birthday, which seemed appropriate. The deal: For a $60 flat fee, you\u2019re sent a couple of new items each month.Stitch Fix and Bombfell use technology and language to reinvent the low-end and midrange department store experience. FiveFour Club is more like a web version of a boutique with a subscription model thrown in for good measure. Instead of appealing to customers with the siren song of a personal stylist, FiveFour charges a price of admission in exchange for regular deliveries of its own branded clothing. (There is also a web store, membership not required.) The aesthetic here is minimal, sporty and young, so fashion-aware that it\u2019s hard to envision who the consumer is. While it\u2019s true we don\u2019t all live in ZIP codes with street wear boutiques, the same person who logs onto FiveFour can log on to eBay. In exchange for my $60 membership fee, I was sent a windbreaker and a tee, both in lackluster shades of brown. On a lanky 19-year-old, they\u2019d look stylish. On anyone else, they look like two garments that cost $30 each.Wouldn\u2019t I like to be a lanky 19-year-old? Of course. Fashion is about fantasy. Here in reality, FiveFour got my $60 and I\u2019ve got these clothes I\u2019ll never wear. Those few of us who never read Marie Kondo still have those fashionable mistakes lurking in our closets. I\u2019m sort of fond of them, those past selves that never came to be. I\u2019ve spent many hours of my life browsing in stores. At 21, I admired clothes I couldn\u2019t afford. At 30, I bought them. At 40, I sometimes go simply for the pleasure, of seeing what is new, of learning what counts as beautiful now. So what, if anything, have we learned? One old lesson, at least. Shopping for clothes is time consuming, it\u2019s tiring, and it can feel like a waste of an autumn afternoon. So you can subscribe to a service that makes your life simpler, although it may come at the expense of expressing who you are. You can also subscribe to the notion that there\u2019s still pleasure in some of life\u2019s chores. In the flesh, you can touch a wool jacket or a cashmere sweater as you imagine who you might be if each belonged to you.Advertisement"}

It is uncushioned and made of an abrasive woolen fabric. A few weeks earlier, I had dragged it through Ikea and then lugged it up the stairs to the top floor of our second- and third-floor duplex.Liz sat upon that third-floor, brand-new, living room rug as she cited its scratchiness and too-small-for-the-space proportion.\u201cDon\u2019t sit on it if it\u2019s so scratchy,\u201d I said.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t, but you don\u2019t have any chairs,\u201d she said, with the sort of smirk that only a best friend could get away with.I decided to show her another of my decorative touches.

Though my husband, children and I had moved in a few months earlier after living in a house in a small town outside the city for seven years, we were still surrounded by boxes.I poured us each a glass of wine, and we talked about my desire to decorate my apartment on a limited budget.Because Liz and I had lived together after college, she knows my taste and my habits of saving newspapers and magazines, of working jigsaw puzzles and playing backgammon, of wanting my books and homemade arts-and-crafts around me.\u201cI want to help,\u201d she said.We made a deal \u2014 I would give Liz a budget that is slightly more than what my husband and I spend on one month\u2019s rent.This is a significant amount of money for me. But as I was disrupting the family with a move that would save me 15 hours a week commuting, I wanted the apartment to feel like a real home.When I asked Liz how much her services cost, she gave me an \u201cif you have to ask, you can\u2019t afford it\u201d answer and said she wanted to do this to test her creative skills at a different price and because she could not deal with knowing that her flighty best friend\u2019s kids, whom she adores, were still living out of cardboard boxes.I knew I was lucky to have Liz\u2019s help, but I got even luckier when her business partner, Julie Fowler, decided to take part.Typically, they decorate clients\u2019 second homes in the Hamptons, and apartments in co-ops with doormen. \u201cIt\u2019s not our wheelhouse or area of expertise,\u201d Julie said of an apartment like mine. \u201cBut if you have the time to really look around, you can find so many great things.\u201dThey came up with flourishes that wowed me. In lieu of spending on bookshelves that might not fit in future apartments, Julie stacked books in the nonworking fireplaces in the living room and the kitchen.They put temporary wallpaper on the massive wall along the staircase because I did not have the amount of art we would need to decorate it. Julie and Liz picked a funky pattern that becomes, on its own, a piece of art that adds to the eclectic feel in the entryway and living room.Though my husband and I had set aside money for the design, I was worried about expenses. Liz and Julie had to push me a few times to go for investment pieces. There is now a midcentury-ish console in our front hall and a custom media cabinet in the living room made of white oak with its interior shelves painted a dark yellow. It holds our turntable and record albums, and my husband, especially, loves it.The biggest problem was my limited time and attention span. There were dozens of texts about when things could get delivered (my husband and I both work full time, and our building has no doorman) and then many more emails to reschedule when furniture delivery guys realized that there were two long, narrow flights of stairs.I have a difficult enough time keeping up with work and the logistics of parenting. I was a flaky correspondent.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve known for years that you are impossible to get in touch with,\u201d Liz said.But I pushed her limits over a faux Sputnik light fixture that she found on eBay that she wanted to hang in the center of our living room. I had given Julie and Liz my credit card information so they would not be out-of-pocket on items bought for me. But Liz asked me to handle this one transaction.I dillydallied and we lost out on the chandelier. (I was afraid to tell Liz.) She then found a different light fixture for $400 and took care of the purchase herself.From then on, I answered their queries in a respectful amount of time, with one of two boilerplate replies: \u201cIs it in my budget?\u201d and \u201cI defer to you.\u201dDeferring to them meant that I did not need to understand their vision of how it would all come together, and it kept me from making it impossible for them to execute it.For example, they wanted to hang fabric panels on either side of the three living room windows. I didn\u2019t see why we needed them since the windows have shutters that fold discreetly to the side and fully block the light and street view when pulled closed.Trust us, they said.The effect of the long deep mustard panels is dramatic and sophisticated. The panels draw your eye to the high ceilings and simultaneously make the space feel cozy.Another detail that I agreed to even though the idea did not make sense to me is the three horizontal, framed mirrors above the mantle.That sounds so dumb! I thought.But I did not agree to all of their plans. When we first moved into the apartment, I disassembled an old, very large, gray couch and pushed part of it against the wall in the kitchen. I then stuck blocks underneath the couch legs to raise it, and put the kitchen table in front of it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a banquette,\u201d I told Liz and Julie, feeling proud.They hated it. They hated it even more than they hated the bar stools that had belonged to my mother that I had set along the kitchen counter.\u201cIt looks like the back seat of an old Chevrolet,\u201d Julie said.Maybe so, but I refused to let them get rid of it or to get new bar stools, seeing no reason to spend money to replace what I already had.On other seating issues, though, I heeded the advice of professionals.We now have a game table with four chairs, perfect for a backgammon- and cards-obsessed family. And we have a new rug, bought from Pier 1, that I managed to get up the stairs by myself.It felt soft under me as I sat on it the other day, while my husband and kids were slung all over the couch watching a movie. I looked around the room and I saw myself through the eyes of one of my oldest friends and, now, one of my newest.Thanks to them, my family was home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Can You Park a Tiny Home?", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by17 PhotosDarryl Bray had hoped to park the 84-square-foot house that he built for himself in a secluded place, maybe on some spare acreage on a farm in Connecticut.But finding that kind of spot proved harder than expected, so instead Mr. Bray\u2019s tiny home on wheels sits in the parking lot of the light industrial complex where he works, outside of New Haven.Mr. Bray, 28, has lived behind the U-shaped complex for more than two years now, though not without hassle \u2014 even though the parking spot was offered to him by the complex\u2019s owner. He started out near a noisy auto shop that was attracting unwanted attention, but has since moved to a quieter space.The city zoning enforcement officer once put him on notice that he was violating various zoning codes. While no one has ever followed up, Mr. Bray lies low when he sees a police cruiser patrolling the complex. (For that reason, he asked that his precise location not be disclosed in this story.)\u201cI do fear coming out of my tiny house and having the police see me there,\u201d he said. \u201cI have blackout curtains on the windows, and I lock my door whenever I\u2019m in there.\u201dZoning regulations in most places \u2014 especially densely developed regions like the New York metro area \u2014 typically do not allow full-time living in temporary structures like R.V.s or movable tiny houses. Most tiny homes are built on wheeled trailers that can be towed. Unlike R.V.s, however, tiny houses are generally not wheeled for touring, so much as for flexibility of location.Zoning also commonly specifies a minimum home or lot size that is too large and expensive for a lifestyle geared toward affordability. Residential building codes can also present a problem for tiny houses built on foundations.\u201cA very small minority live in R.V. parks, though they usually have a limit on how long you can stay,\u201d he said. \u201cA friend or family\u2019s backyard, or land in the country, is much more common.\u201dBut with the tiny-living craze having lasted well past the fad stage, pressure is growing for municipalities to embrace tiny houses as legal residences. And more tiny-house building companies are popping up, anticipating just such a shift.\u201cIt\u2019s a spirit of cooperation,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple way to bring in affordable housing that doesn\u2019t cost the municipality anything.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a fear that people are going to end up living in shanty shacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that either. We want people to be safe in their houses, and in something they can afford.\u201dFor the time being, however, finding a place to live long-term in a tiny house requires creativity, flexibility and considerable networking.For Amy Garner and John McCarthy, it was a conversation over coffee with a well-connected architect that led them to the ideal location for their 340-square-foot tiny house in New Haven: waterside, at a marina on the Quinnipiac River.\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d said Ms. Garner, 30. \u201cYou wake up in the morning, and the sun reflects off the water, and you get this twinkle effect on the bedroom ceiling.\u201dThey have been there since April without issue, other than the occasional curious passers-by. And now they have a like-minded neighbor: A woman living in an Airstream, an aluminum-sided travel trailer, recently moved in behind them.Lisa Cohen and Richard Ratcliff, who met last spring while hiking the Appalachian Trail, are hoping for similar stability while they finish converting a school bus they bought on eBay into a tiny house. Finding a place to park it within reasonable commuting distance of Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, N.Y., where Ms. Cohen is a graduate student, was no easy feat.\u201cWe asked a few farms, a gardening center and a flea market,\u201d Ms. Cohen, 27, said in an email. \u201cEveryone was kind and said they would think it over, but then would either not answer calls or said \u2018no\u2019 in the end.\u201dEventually the couple found a restaurant owner in Dutchess County willing to let them park off to the side of his lot for $150 a month. (They asked that the restaurant not be identified.) Settled there for about a month now, they have access to electricity and well water. The train ride to Sarah Lawrence takes Ms. Cohen about 90 minutes, with three transfers, but she is appreciative of the spot, which she deemed preferable to \u201cending up in Walmart parking lots.\u201dBrianna Welch, 25, starts graduate school at the University of Vermont in January, and hopes to move from her Bronx apartment to the Burlington area in a 340-square-foot tiny house being built by Craft & Sprout. She and her husband, Chris Murphy, a 24-year-old software product manager, are actively hunting for land to rent, hoping to get settled before the first snow.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be through our network that we find someone who knows someone who has land,\u201d Ms. Welch said. \u201cWe knew this would be the hardest part, but I didn\u2019t think it would be this hard.\u201d\u201cPeople think they\u2019ll throw their house on a cheap piece of land and that\u2019s the end of it,\u201d said Mr. Porges, who lives in a regular house in a nearby town. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize all the logistical challenges they\u2019re going to face.\u201dHe wound up hiring an electrician to lay heavy-gauge extension cords connecting the tiny house to a power supply elsewhere on the farm. And he invested in hoses specially designed for potable water to run downhill to his house from a spigot. But come winter, he expects those hoses will freeze, once again necessitating the use of the water tanks.As for the dry-flush toilet, it functions as expected, essentially \u201cshrink-wrapping your waste,\u201d Mr. Porges said. But the disposable cartridges are fairly expensive: He calculates the cost at about $1 per flush. Other bathroom options for tiny homes include composting and incineration toilets.\u201cThe roots that we had planted felt more like shackles,\u201d said Ms. Richardson, 46. \u201cIt takes some courage to go against that societal template of life, but we decided we wanted to have more experiences and less things.\u201dAs they both are able to work remotely, their plan is to tow their house up to northern New England later this fall \u2013 although they haven\u2019t yet found a place to park it. While they\u2019re not entirely averse to living under the radar, they would prefer to find a town where they can live aboveboard, Ms. Richardson said.And if all else fails, they have a fallback: a year-round R.V. park they heard about in New Hampshire. \u201cThat\u2019s our last choice,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. \u201cBut if we have to, we will do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Opened in Brooklyn With a Giant Skate Bowl. We Dropped In.", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a decade and a half later, all the signifiers are now mixed up: Supreme has been woven into the fashion firmament, thanks to a series of shrewd partnerships, both in the high-fashion and street-wear worlds. It recently collaborated with Louis Vuitton on a capsule collection. The Lafayette store has become a tourist attraction and a generator of long lines, requiring high levels of emotional fortitude to navigate. Skating feels ancillary.And so the bowl that takes up the back half of the new Supreme store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn \u2014 which had its opening party on Thursday night \u2014 has some of the performative qualities of that Deitch Projects exhibit. (By coincidence, it was built by Steve Badgett, who worked on the Deitch Project bowl.) There is a bowl in Supreme\u2019s Los Angeles store, too, but this one looms larger.Within minutes of the party\u2019s start, skaters were feeling out its contours, while nonskaters were taking to the cameras on their phones, to show the world that they were near skaters. The later it got, the more people were squeezed around the bowl\u2019s rim, participants and observers in symbiosis.Down on the floor, Supreme was showing off its latest collections, which include collaborations with the artist Andres Serrano, the Italian outerwear specialist Stone Island and the conglomerate Nike. There were things to be had for under $50, and also for more than 10 times that, reflecting the brand\u2019s role as both entry point and end goal. It is also the raw material for a vibrant and thirsty resale ecosystem with prices that can rise exponentially on the internet\u2019s gray markets.Putting a Supreme in Brooklyn doesn\u2019t mean what it might have in the bleeding-edge Williamsburg of two decades ago, or in its partly gentrified late-2000s version. It\u2019s a family neighborhood now \u2014 a wealthy family neighborhood \u2014 with seven-figure condominiums and Michelin-starred restaurants. With square footage that\u2019s about three times the Lafayette store, this location figures to be more relaxed than the flagship: a place where the brand can breathe, a reclaiming of the hometown, a maturation without surrender.In the crowd, there were skaters (Mark Gonzales, Sage Elsesser), celebrities (Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, James Franco), avatars of good taste (Mister Mort, Venus X), at least two people in hyper-chunky Balenciaga Triple S sneakers, a troop of public relations representatives and, out on the street, security alternating between pushing people off the sidewalk and back on it. (And also children: There were probably more attendees under the age of 13 than, say, between 13 and 20.)And of course, there were the hounds. Nothing was available for sale at the party \u2014 the store officially opens Thursday \u2014 but there was a special T-shirt made for the occasion, with a yellow, green and black camouflage box logo, exactly the sort of limited item the brand\u2019s loyalists salivate over. And indeed, late in the night, some of them were out on the street, sidling up to people who walked out with white Supreme bags and offering them cash. Not long after, some shirts were already selling on eBay for more than $1,000. A live sculpture, to be sure.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Good Taste Teachable?", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaste presents an age-old quandary: It is notoriously hard to define. Discussions on the topic often fade into unhelpful aphorisms like \u201cto each her own\u201d or \u201clive and let live.\u201d After all, what is too much chintz to one person is comfortable and cozy to another. My favorite abstract painter may leave you cold or, in that proverbial art jab, look like the work of a toddler.The subject becomes even more delicate as we discover that d\u00e9cor and art preferences aren\u2019t entirely subjective. Sociologists tell us there\u2019s a strong social component; notions of elegance have roots in class dynamics. Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but it can also reveal socioeconomic status. Our homes reflect, at least, as much about our peers as ourselves.\u201cAmericans in particular love hobbies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they can use those same visual impulses to develop an eye for art and design.\u201d For instance, those who take joy in cooking have, most likely, already refined an instinct for quality culinary wares. They may not realize it: their beloved Le Creuset conforms to the same principles of superior craftsmanship as any of Dr. Anderson\u2019s cherished possessions, such as the midcentury tackle box that belonged to his father. A cyclist already brings such rigor to bikes; the philatelist to stamps. The trick is exercising this brain reflex to new stimuli.Yet what about hiring an interior designer or art adviser? Can you outsource the pursuit of taste and still have a home that reflects an internal quality compass? \u201cAs with a ski instructor, you should eventually break free as a student,\u201d Dr. Anderson said, \u201ceven if you take a tumble on the slopes once in a while.\u201d He cautions, though, that mistakes will be made. An object\u2019s high price tag is no guarantee of quality.\u201cIf you haven\u2019t developed a good reflex,\u201d he added, \u201cyou may make choices that are only indexed to cost, but often don\u2019t have much to do with the work itself.\u201dLearning to see the quality instinct in other people\u2019s space is also key to developing better judgment. Houses with strong aesthetics may come in every shape and size, but they too hold several teachable lessons. Chief among them: Thou shalt not copy. Parroting a magazine or someone else\u2019s home seldom achieves a result worth much retrospection.\u201cWe wanted no separation between our art and family existence,\u201d she explained, \u201cone flows right into the other.\u201d They credit Bauhaus modernism and dual artist marriages, like Josef and Anni Albers, as inspiration. At the same time, Mr. Cheng admires the power of Instagram and the many skilled nonprofessional hobbyists who now post inspirational tableaus for their followers. \u201cPeople have really started composing some beautiful photos,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it shows taste can absolutely evolve. But you have to be open to it.\u201dAnd the result reflects their individual tastes \u2014 complementary, Mr. Riley explained, but not fully aligned. Both he and Ms. Cohen brought objects into their space that convey their personal aesthetics, joint decision-making and history, in reminding them of their parents. Taken together, their approach is a studied blend of past and present, which manages to feel spare and full at once.The couple also illustrate that a collection of only store-bought objects \u2014 no matter how thoughtfully selected \u2014 lacks something: good taste should be personalized. For example, one of Mr. Riley\u2019s prized possessions is a wedding gift from his wife, a simple painting that she made of black numerals, on white paper that faces their bed. It is the longitude and latitude of their engagement location \u2014 reminiscent, to him, of an On Kawara painting.Justin Norman is paradigmatic of the ideas in \u201cThe Quality Instinct,\u201d that someone who has never spent any time around Whitney caliber art can teach himself to see like a museum director.At 19, Mr. Norman left the home of the family that adopted him at 8 after social workers removed him and his five siblings from their biological parents. He got work as a bartender but dreamed of opening a skate shop, because skateboarding was his obsession. When he was 22, Larry Ryalls, the father of a high school friend (and now business partner, Eric Ryalls), requested help listing some of his furniture collection on eBay. Mr. Norman said he was \u201cinstantly obsessed with the midcentury pieces,\u201d especially the iconic Mad Men chairs he\u2019d never encountered in real life. The molded plywood of an Eames chair, he said, reminded him of skateboards.As a craftsman, he also warns the truly discerning: an authentic, new Eames lounge from a website, while lovely in its own right, is essentially a contemporary chair. The lounge of today won\u2019t ever look or feel like one from the 50s or 60s. Something will always feel off. \u201cThat\u2019s O.K. for some people. They don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s different quality,\u201c he explained. \u201cBut a restored Eames will always have more visual character, even if a buyer can\u2019t put their finger on exactly why that is.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s what Mr. Norman calls the odyssey. With an original, there\u2019s always a back story \u2014 a search and a journey, as he described it. Often, clients wait months for the particular chair and decade they desire. \u201cPeople who have good taste really love the hunt,\u201d he said. There\u2019s an experiential component, he said, that\u2019s absent when you buy \u201cnew midcentury designs,\u201d alone at the computer or from a retail chain\u2019s sales person. Restoring a chair with an artisan is an aesthetically distinct way to acquire a possession \u2014 especially from someone like Mr. Norman, who can teach you to see every quality detail that makes an object beautiful.Jacoba Urist is a journalist in New York CityAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Year Later, Trial to Begin in Chelsea Bombing Case", "Date": "2017-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPipe bombs stashed at the finish line of a beachside \u201cfun run.\u201d Pressure cookers in Manhattan\u2019s busy Chelsea neighborhood, packed with steel nuts and ball bearings purchased on eBay. Citric acid, fuses, circuit boards. A magazine with articles like \u201cMake a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\u201dThe trial that begins Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan will lay out the trove of evidence behind the creation and deployment of bombs in New York and New Jersey just over a year ago that collectively tore through metal, glass and the city\u2019s sense of security. And prosecutors, using evidence from the defendant\u2019s internet searches, phone videos and text messages, will seek to place the man, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, who lived in Elizabeth, N.J., above his father\u2019s chicken restaurant, squarely on the misfit-to-jihadist path familiar in terror attacks worldwide.No one was killed in the bombings, and Mr. Rahimi, a 29-year-old Afghan-born United States citizen, has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said 31 people were injured, with some expected to testify at the trial and to tell of glass and metal fragments piercing their limbs and faces.But for all the havoc wrought during the region\u2019s two days in a grip of fear and an interstate dragnet, the evidence collected is a reminder of how much worse it could have been. Of the four devices set to explode, only one did as planned, a combination of bad luck and apparent mistakes that almost certainly saved lives.A short while later, another device \u2014 a pressure cooker packed with explosives and steel bearings \u2014 was discovered four blocks away, on West 27th Street. The police disarmed the device, and found a dozen fingerprints. The prints matched Mr. Rahimi\u2019s, prosecutors said.He was indicted on charges of using a weapon of mass destruction, planting bombs and transporting explosives over state lines. He faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted of either of two counts in the indictment that charge use of a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.His trial is expected to last at least two weeks before Judge Richard M. Berman. Last week, Mr. Rahimi asked, through his attorney, to be allowed to skip court proceedings on Fridays for prayer. The judge said he would allow the absences. The trial would continue without him.The trial follows months of legal skirmishes between prosecutors and Mr. Rahimi\u2019s attorneys, who attempted to exclude several pieces of evidence and mention of events in the timeline of the bombings before jurors.After his arrest, Mr. Rahimi was questioned by investigators in the hospital, under a so-called public-safety exception to the Miranda rules, used when the authorities believe there is an imminent threat to public safety. During the questioning, he said there were no other bombs, and that he had learned how to make them on a computer. Mr. Rahimi\u2019s attorneys asked that those statements be kept out of the trial because he was under medication and not of clear mind. The arguments were rendered moot when prosecutors said they would not introduce the statements.Mr. Rahimi is charged separately in New Jersey State and federal courts with crimes related to the shootout with police and the bombs found there. No reference to the shootout is to be made during this trial, Judge Berman has ordered, as it is not covered in the indictment and could be more inflammatory to jurors than it is relevant. However, prosecutors will be allowed to make reference to the New Jersey bombs, as they were similar in construction and materials to the New York devices.Prosecutors have indicated that they intend to bring some or all of the exploded Dumpster into the courtroom to show jurors. Defense attorneys objected last week, calling the display unnecessary.Prosecutors have said they will call a terrorism expert to parse the journal\u2019s references to past terror attacks. They are expected to show jurors the copies of magazines linked to Al Qaeda found in the defendant\u2019s computer, as well as YouTube videos of what court documents describe as jihad \u201canthems.\u201dFor all that, there are no suggestions that Mr. Rahimi acted as part of a conspiracy to set the bombs. No terror group claimed responsibility for the bombings last year or took credit for playing any role in training Mr. Rahimi. His admiration for those groups, as suggested in the journal, appears to have been one-way.Advertisement"}

Though S\u00e9zane is reasonably priced \u2014 dresses are generally under $200 \u2014 and maintains a friendly girl-next-arrondissement attitude, pieces sometimes sell out so fast that nabbing one can feel worth bragging about. And the quick turnover keeps customers (whose attention spans are shrinking at an ever faster clip) entertained.For Ms. S\u00e9zalory, 32, the idea of releasing items in drops came by necessity and convenience, rather than by clever marketing. Twelve years ago, she began selling vintage clothing and accessories on eBay. She had an eye for what would sell and knew how to present items in an aspirational way that was uncommon among many eBay vendors. Before long, she was earning enough money to make a full-time gig of it.In 2008, she introduced her first online shop, Les Composantes, which sold vintage and reworked vintage pieces. To save herself multiple trips to the post office, she would release all of the new goods on one day each month in what she called \u201crendezvous,\u201d informing customers via newsletter. Sometimes the new batch would sell out within hours, she said.Eventually Ms. S\u00e9zalory decided she was ready to build a full-fledged fashion label. Despite having no formal training, she began designing clothing and accessories heavily influenced by Paris street style and the vintage items she loved, calling her new label S\u00e9zane (a contraction of her first and last names). Though her creations were no longer one-offs, and she had help with those trips to the post office, she kept the monthly rendezvous, which, she said, felt \u201cspecial.\u201dEach capsule is introduced with an extensive photo campaign with distinctive casting and a new setting. \u201cThe first thing I discovered when I was on eBay was the power of a nice picture,\u201d Ms. S\u00e9zalory said. \u201cBack then, women were not used to buying clothes online, so you had to show them through a picture how the fabric is, how to wear it. I wanted the girl to feel like she can touch the clothes, and see how she could mix it with something. I\u2019m still very obsessed with this.\u201dIt\u2019s the reason, she said, that S\u00e9zane often photographs its clothes in far-flung locales and never in a studio. \u201cWhen the customer discovers the collection, she also discovers a new feeling, a country,\u201d Ms. S\u00e9zalory said. \u201cAnd since we\u2019ve been there, too, we can share with her the good addresses of where to eat, what to do.\u201dLike the store in Paris, the NoLIta outpost, at 254 Elizabeth Street, is named L\u2019Appartement and is styled after the apartment of a woman you want to hang out with for a little while, maybe learn something from. \u201cFashion is not only fashion,\u201d Ms. S\u00e9zalory said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about inspiration.\u201dIn a concession to customer demand, S\u00e9zane has started to offer seasonal collections that stick around longer, and this month it introduced La Liste, its first permanent collection. It offers \u201ciconic Parisian\u201d staples that Ms. S\u00e9zalory described as \u201cthe main pieces every woman should have in her closet, but not boring.\u201dBut the monthly rendezvous will remain.Advertisement"}
