{"Headline": "The Frightful Five Want to Rule Entertainment. They Are Hitting Limits.", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that\u2019s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline.Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing \u2014 in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches \u2014 are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit.This is the first of several columns in which I\u2019ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment \u2014 their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked.Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201dThe Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.There\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201dThis story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?It\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It\u2019s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up.Advertisement"}

On songs that mix jazz, punk, dub, hip-hop and the affectations of a zonked-out lounge crooner, he has cut what he calls \u201cgritty stories about the streets\u201d with a \u201csensitive and romantic side,\u201d aiming to take \u201csocial realism and make it social surrealism.\u201dHe\u2019s also timelessly cool, a child of bohemia with a sharp proletarian edge, tall and model-gaunt with a gold-capped front tooth and a fluff of red hair. \u201cIn the dead of night I howl/We all have our evils,\u201d Mr. Marshall snarls in his harsh, accented baritone on the new King Krule album, \u201cThe Ooz,\u201d out Oct. 13, returning to his typical themes.It felt fitting, then, that after a few years away from New York \u2014 a city that, like London, values a grimy deadbeat with a pretentious side \u2014 King Krule played a secret show well after midnight, in an overstuffed Manhattan dim sum restaurant known to certain youthful types for its after-hours parties and lax indoor smoking rules. Huddled at a table among the fashionably disheveled fans, Mr. Marshall, in red plastic sunglasses and an unreleased Supreme shirt, scrawled a set list in capital letters for the sweaty concert that would help mark his return to the underground hype cycle that threatens to deify him.\u201cThe Ooz\u201d is a return to himself, written over three years when Mr. Marshall moved back in with his mother in the district of East Dulwich in London. At 19 tracks and more than an hour long, the album, his second as King Krule, feels like a swan dive into Mr. Marshall\u2019s turbulent subconscious, jarring by design as it lurches from laid-back almost-rap (\u201cBiscuit Town\u201d) to post-Clash punk (\u201cDum Surfer\u201d) back to \u201950s-style rock \u2019n\u2019 roll balladeering (\u201cLonely Blue\u201d).The titular \u201cooz\u201d \u2014 a versatile metaphor that applies equally well to mental health and songwriting \u2014 represents all the excess crud our bodies are constantly discharging. \u201cYou go to sleep and your nails grow, you get boogies, your hair, your teeth,\u201d Mr. Marshall explained while chain-smoking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to refine it every day.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about creating a universe for yourself,\u201d said Mr. Marshall, who credits film (David Lynch, Jim Jarmusch, George A. Romero), literature (W.H. Auden, Charles Bukowski) and video games for his dedication to world-building and penchant for scattering referential Easter eggs.Courting obsessive listeners and not flooding the market, Mr. Marshall said, is a survival tactic. \u201cYou see kids, they make one good track, they do one great feature and then they\u2019re everywhere, they\u2019ve got a million people watching them,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to develop and preserve my art.\u201d\u201cIf you overdo it, people get sick of you,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve just reveled in being kind of mysterious.\u201d (In addition to King Krule, Mr. Marshall has made music under aliases including Zoo Kid, DJ JD Sports and Edgar the Beatmaker.)Dean Bein, the founder of True Panther Sounds, Mr. Marshall\u2019s label, wrote in an email that upon meeting the singer, at 15, \u201cI knew he was special. Even then, he didn\u2019t do anything for the look or for attention. His moves are always decisive.\u201d Mr. Bein recalled Mr. Marshall turning down a \u201csuper prominent magazine cover\u201d early on \u201cbecause he felt he hadn\u2019t earned it yet,\u201d and balking similarly at \u201csome very notable collaborations because he couldn\u2019t see how the artists\u2019 sounds would work with his.\u201dMr. Marshall was more blunt. \u201cI remember even getting hit up by Kanye to go to the studio. Anyone else in my shoes would\u2019ve done it,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be bothered.\u201d It wasn\u2019t out of a sense of superiority, he stressed, but because of the pressure to create on call.\u201cI like the physicality of living with someone, sleeping next to them, eating with them. And eventually we might make a tune,\u201d Mr. Marshall said. \u201cI\u2019ve turned down so many opportunities where I could maybe be rich right now.\u201d He stopped himself with a laugh and an expletive. \u201cUgh, why didn\u2019t I do it?\u201dMr. Bein added: \u201cAs his record label, you can imagine this has often been frustrating,\u201d but Mr. Marshall\u2019s devotion to his art \u201ceasily trumps any frustration that might come from the counter-commercial moves he\u2019s made over the years.\u201dFor \u201cThe Ooz,\u201d Mr. Marshall found inspiration in a combination of the conventional and the foreign. Back in his old neighborhood, he had collaborated with his older brother, Jack, on an art book and short film with a more beat-oriented soundtrack (\u201cA New Place 2 Drown,\u201d released in 2015 under his given name), but more traditional songwriting was not flowing.\u201cI was going to the same pubs, chilling with the same friends,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I got these two exotic people in my life and all of a sudden things started to change.\u201dOne was a Spanish saxophonist named Ignacio Salvadores, who sent Mr. Marshall an unsolicited video on Facebook of himself playing under a London bridge. Moved by its beauty, Mr. Marshall invited him to come play at a show that very night, and there, they jammed for hours \u2014 \u201cno conversation, just straight playing music,\u201d Mr. Marshall said. Mr. Salvadores went on to perform on much of the album.Also featured on \u201cThe Ooz,\u201d speaking a poem in Spanish, is a woman from Barcelona whom Mr. Marshall called a muse. \u201cIt gave me something romantic, every time I\u2019d go home,\u201d Mr. Marshall said. \u201cEvery night I\u2019d play guitar and she\u2019d be sat there and she\u2019d look beautiful. It helped my outlook on myself and the record.\u201dLater on the album, Mr. Marshall\u2019s father reads an English translation of the same poem, which again is packed with King Krule\u2019s thematic connective tissue: isolation, drowning, the moon, the color blue. \u201cMe and you against this city of parasites,\u201d he concludes. \u201cParasite/paradise.\u201dFamilial connections, including to his divorced parents, are another through line in Mr. Marshall\u2019s work, a key to decoding his disparate influences and philosophical dogmas. His mother (\u201ca wild one\u201d) is a musician and screen printer who recorded a \u201cdub-jazz poetry record\u201d and hung a portrait of Fela Kuti in her home, while his father, an art director and musician from a line of artists, introduced his son to classic rock. \u201cAll of their taste is so refined and so cool,\u201d Mr. Marshall said, as if he were giving away his secret.\u201cEveryone in my family can put pen to paper and sell it,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they don\u2019t sell it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Woman Who Created #MeToo Long Before Hashtags", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 1997, Tarana Burke sat across from a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually abused. The young girl was explaining her experience, and it left Ms. Burke speechless. That moment is where the Me Too campaign was born.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a response or a way to help her in that moment, and I couldn\u2019t even say \u2018me too,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Burke said.\u201cIt really bothered me, and it sat in my spirit for a long time,\u201d she added.Ten years after that conversation, Ms. Burke created Just Be Inc., a nonprofit organization that helps victims of sexual harassment and assault. She sought out the resources that she had not found readily available to her 10 years before and committed herself to being there for people who had been abused.And she gave her movement a name: Me Too.On Sunday, those two words burst into the spotlight of social media with #metoo, a hashtag promoted by the actress Alyssa Milano. Amid the firestorm that ignited, some women of color noted pointedly that the longtime effort by Ms. Burke, who is black, had not received support over the years from prominent white feminists.Ms. Milano was seeking to give a voice to sexual abuse victims, after accusations of sexual harassment and assault were leveled against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.The purpose was to uplift one another as they saw a disparity in how women of color were treated when they reported abuse.\u201cWhite women have not been as supportive as they could have been of women of color when they experience targeted abuse and harassment,\u201d Ms. Reign said in an interview.And so, when Ms. Milano tweeted out the #metoo hashtag without crediting Ms. Burke, some noted that black women had again been left out of the story.\u201cWomen of color are demanded to be silent and are erased,\u201d Ms. Reign said. \u201cLike with Tarana.\u201dMs. Burke, too, said she was alarmed when she saw Ms. Milano\u2019s tweet.\u201cInitially I panicked,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt a sense of dread, because something that was part of my life\u2019s work was going to be co-opted and taken from me and used for a purpose that I hadn\u2019t originally intended.\u201dBut Ms. Milano, who said she had been unaware of Ms. Burke\u2019s campaign, moved to correct the problem.She reached out to Ms. Burke two days after she sent out the #metoo tweet and is hoping to collaborate.\u201cShe has been very grateful and gracious,\u201d Ms. Burke said.On Thursday, Ms. Milano went on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d where she publicly credited Ms. Burke for her Me Too campaign.\u201cWhat the Me Too campaign really does, and what Tarana Burke has really enabled us to do, is put the focus back on the victims,\u201d Ms. Milano said in an interview with Robin Roberts.Amplifying the voice of the victims has always been Ms. Burke\u2019s goal. Despite \u201ca great lack of intersectionality across these various movements,\u201d Ms. Burke, whose campaign predates the widespread adoption of social media, said she also believes that the Me Too campaign is bigger than just one person.\u201cI think it is selfish for me to try to frame Me Too as something that I own,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is bigger than me and bigger than Alyssa Milano. Neither one of us should be centered in this work. This is about survivors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Raw Power of #MeToo", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few years back, when there were still three teenagers in this house, I got a little wound up at supper one night and kept going on and on about the brilliance of a novel I was reading by an Irish-born writer. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve never been there,\u201d one of my sons said. \u201cAs much as you love this stuff, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve never been to Ireland or England.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s expensive,\u201d I said. \u201cFirst I had no money, and then I had a bunch of kids. And y\u2019all need shoes more than I need Ireland. I\u2019ll get there one day.\u201dThe skeptical teen was not satisfied with this answer. \u201cDad biked around Europe all by himself for nine months before he even went to college,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could have done that, too, if you\u2019d wanted it bad enough.\u201dAnd it\u2019s true: My husband did in fact earn the money to bike his way across Europe at age 19. Alone.I taught my sons to stand when an adult enters the room. I taught them to look people in the eye and extend a hand when introduced. I taught them to put their napkins in their laps, not to speak with their mouths full, to stand up for children being bullied. What I had not taught them, it suddenly dawned on me, was how it feels to go through the world as a woman, the mental calculations involved in parking a car downtown or riding an elevator at night or taking a walk in the woods.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for a woman to camp alone,\u201d I finally said at the table that night. \u201cThere are women who do it, but I\u2019m not that brave.\u201dMy children grew up with stories of their father\u2019s adventures. They did not grow up with stories of mine. I didn\u2019t tell them the story of the 16-year-old family \u201cfriend\u201d who babysat while his parents and mine went out to dinner the year I was 11, how he followed me around the apartment, tugging on my blouse and telling me I should take it off, pulling at the elastic waistband of my pants and telling me I should take them off, how I finally locked myself in my bedroom and didn\u2019t come out till my parents got home.I didn\u2019t tell my children the story of walking with my friend to the town hardware store when we were 14. I didn\u2019t tell them that my friend used her babysitting money to buy a screwdriver and a deadbolt lock to keep her older brother out of her room at night.I didn\u2019t tell my children the story of my first job, the job I started the week I turned 16, and how the manager kept making excuses to go back to the storeroom whenever I was at the fry station, how he would squeeze his corpulent frame between the counter and me, dragging his sweaty crotch across my rear end on each trip.I didn\u2019t tell my children about the time in graduate school when I had to call the police because there was a man crouching in the bushes next to my front steps, or about the former professor who told me that my impending marriage put an end to the \u201clongest-running act of foreplay\u201d he had ever engaged in. What I had thought of as an avuncular interest in my career he had thought of as an unrealized act of seduction.There is nothing unusual about these stories. They are the ho-hum, everyday experiences of virtually every woman I know, and such stories rarely get told. There will never be a powerful social-media movement that begins, \u201cToday I ate breakfast\u201d or \u201cToday my dog pooped and I cleaned it up\u201d or \u201cToday I washed my hair with the same shampoo I\u2019ve been buying since 2006.\u201d We tell the stories that are remarkable in some way, stories that are surprising, utterly unexpected. The quotidian doesn\u2019t make for a good tale.I don\u2019t know any woman who is surprised by these stories, or by the sheer, vast numbers of them. But men are. Some \u2014 by one account 300,000 of them \u2014 are writing to point out that they have been harassed, too, because of course the abuse of power isn\u2019t gender- or orientation-specific. Others have started their own hashtag: #IHearYou. These are men, like my sons, who have not consistently heard these stories before because for too long women have not considered them stories worth telling. Or because too often such stories are not believed.It\u2019s an irony worth pointing out that the novel I was telling my children about at dinner that night was \u201cRoom\u201d by Emma Donoghue, the story of a woman who was kidnapped from her college campus and kept as a sex slave in a backyard shed. Even reading that beautiful, heartbreaking book, it had not occurred to me to tell my children the story of all the times I wanted to go camping or hiking or traveling myself but didn\u2019t dare because I couldn\u2019t find anyone to go with me.This kind of activism inevitably moves out of the news cycle when the possibility of thermonuclear war becomes a more pressing concern, when global warming becomes a more pressing concern, when desperate refugees in mortal danger become a more pressing concern, when women\u2019s ability to make decisions about their own bodies becomes a more pressing concern, when millions of uninsured Americans become a more pressing concern. The list of urgent dangers we now face goes on and on and on. But it\u2019s worth noting that most of them can be directly attributed to a man who boasted of being able to violate women at will, and face no consequences at all.Advertisement"}

Calling something \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d sounds hysterical and alarmist; \u201cexistential threat\u201d feels more solemn, gravely analytical, as if you\u2019ve been poring over classified reports with world-weary experts. It is the verbal equivalent of a B-movie scientist somberly removing his glasses.It was Sept. 11, 2001, that sent existential concerns slamming into American speech. But there was something new, something dissonant, in the way we began to use the word \u2014 a change meant to accommodate the idea that just 19 men might strike at a nation\u2019s being. We\u2019d been exposed to an event people found truly unimaginable, one that shifted their sense of the world and what seemed possible in it. And yet, disorientingly, day-to-day American life continued. No armies massed on the country\u2019s borders. The nation felt itself plunged into momentous conflict, and yet so much of that conflict existed somewhere else \u2014 not just in remote places but in abstractions and arguments over what developments, far from any battlefield, would indicate that \u201cthe terrorists have won.\u201dThis was an interesting shift in definition. It\u2019s not that Israel would be \u2014 as is so often actively threatened \u2014 wiped from the map. But it would lose a thing many consider central to its essence, a thing without which it could no longer be considered itself. But what makes a thing itself? We\u2019re brought right back to philosophical questions. What is a nation, really? Precisely what would have to change for America to no longer qualify, in your estimation, as America at all?Not 20 years ago, we seemed less apt to think this way. Totalizing, annihilating threats were for cranks, alarmists, extremists and speculating academics. Follow the path of existential danger, though, and you can track a slow shift in the tenor of our conversations. A few decades ago, we were still swaddled in a consensus that made us feel as if things were unlikely to change or end, even if we dearly wanted them to; the order of the world was too firm for that. Now we are more practiced than ever in spotting potential ends. We have made sport of it. We find wrenching, apocalyptic change lurking inside everything \u2014 enough to invoke just the kind of despair European intellectuals used to write plays about.Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for The Times Magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Middle East Feud Looms Over Jailing of Egyptian Woman", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Confined to a tiny windowless cell without a mattress or a toilet, denied visitors and held in solitary for months on end, Ola al-Qaradawi is being subjected to harsh treatment even by the grim standards of Egyptian prisons.Ms. Qaradawi, 55, was arrested in June when national security officers swooped in on her family\u2019s summer villa on the Mediterranean coast. Since then, her lawyers say, she has been denied the most basic privileges, and is allowed a single, five-minute bathroom break every morning.What crime merits such tough conditions is unclear. The Egyptian authorities have yet to formally charge Ms. Qaradawi, who works in an embassy and is a permanent American resident, or her husband, Hosam Khalaf, who is being held in similar conditions at a separate Cairo prison. State news media outlets say they are accused of belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood.\u201cA big part of this is about Qatar,\u201d said Aayah Khalaf, Ms. Qaradawi\u2019s daughter.Mr. Qaradawi is one of the Arab world\u2019s most popular televangelists. For years, his regular appearances on \u201cShariah and Life\u201d on Al Jazeera attracted tens of millions of viewers. His popularity stemmed from his folksy, religiously inflected guidance on a wide range of subjects, from oral sex and the morality of lottery cards to when it is acceptable to own a dog.Mr. Qaradawi, a longtime resident of Qatar, is less popular among Western governments: Britain, the United States and some European countries have refused him visas because of his pronouncements in favor of violent attacks on American soldiers in Iraq, and in favor of suicide bombings in Israel.In television terms the bespectacled cleric, 90, is a waning force: His last broadcast was about four years ago. But he still widely viewed as the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, and his presence in Qatar is a longstanding irritation for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Egypt stepped up its demand for Mr. Qaradawi\u2019s extradition as one condition for the lifting of the anti-Qatar boycott, shortly after it was imposed in early June. Qatar\u2019s leaders, who have a longstanding relationship with Mr. Qaradawi and have given him Qatari citizenship, refused to comply.Then, on June 30, Egyptian security forces seized his daughter and her husband, Mr. Khalaf, 58, at their vacation home on Egypt\u2019s Mediterranean coast. The security forces raided their Cairo apartment and confiscated money, jewelry and documents. In August, the authorities froze the couple\u2019s assets which, they said, were being used to finance the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201cIt is unbelievable that we are now living in the era of taking hostages from the families of opponents,\u201d Mostafa al-Naggar, a former lawmaker, wrote in a Facebook post.Ms. Qaradawi and her husband were already under official scrutiny before their arrest. Mr. Khalaf was imprisoned in 2014 for his ties to a small Islamist political party, and released without charge two years later. Ms. Qaradawi is employed as a researcher at the Qatari Embassy in Cairo.They hope their status as American residents, which they obtained last year, might help persuade the White House to take up their case. Although President Trump has hailed Mr. Sisi as a \u201cfantastic guy,\u201d his administration in August cut or withheld $291 million in aid in response to Mr. Sisi\u2019s woeful human rights record.Last spring, in one of his administration\u2019s most clear-cut foreign policy achievements, Mr. Trump helped secure the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American aid worker imprisoned in Egypt.But the Muslim Brotherhood, never popular in Washington, is an especially tough sell right now. Mr. Trump considered designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization this year, holding back only on the advice of intelligence officials and diplomats.Although he denies being a member of the Brotherhood, his sermons are hugely influential in Egypt, where Mr. Sisi\u2019s government has charged him with terrorism. Some sermons are tinged with sectarianism \u2014 he once said that Christians in Egypt have sided with the military and the West against the Brotherhood.The Egyptian prosecutor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.Advertisement"}

When I hear him, his words become every man who has whistled and jeered at my adolescent body, every adult whose tongue dripped with violence thinly veiled behind a murmured \u201csweetheart\u201d or \u201cbabe.\u201d As girls, we are taught that our very existence is enough to make us targets.Along with the onslaught of articles condemning Mr. Weinstein are articles blaming victims for their reactions, expressing shock at the fact that some of the women accepted money settlements. Sexual harassment is not the women\u2019s fault. It is not up to the victims to fix.I cannot speak for all women of my generation, but I would like for ours to be the last that teaches daughters to be modest rather than sons to be respectful.INES AITSAHALIA, 1712th Grade, Princeton High School, Princeton, N.J.I never imagined that late-night TV would one day divide, rather than unify, Americans. However, with entertainment hosts like Jimmy Kimmel bringing controversial political issues to the living room, a growing number of viewers are lamenting the disappearance of pure, politics-free entertainment. I imagine Americans want their entertainers to stick to celebrity news because they believe one\u2019s politics, like religion, is a private subject. But I can\u2019t help thinking that this is precisely the reason we should be discussing political issues on more public platforms. Through open debates and conversations with ideological opposites, people are able to forge well-informed and multifaceted political opinions. Without conversation and discussion, polarization has no mediator. In silence, people drift further apart, until it\u2019s too late to mend the gaping divides that are splitting the nation.ANDREW SIYOON HAM, 1712th Grade, Seoul International School, Seoul, South KoreaPresident Trump\u2019s disruption is not self-destructive at all. His impulses to break traditions of diplomacy and restraint may be destructive to the nation, but will protect Mr. Trump himself. Brinkmanship with North Korea threatens American troops, allies in Asia, even American soil, while his bellicosity fortifies his own base. The administration\u2019s casual relationship with truth makes the United States less credible abroad, but exploiting the resentments his base holds solidifies his support. Mr. Trump\u2019s most keen sense is what is best for him; his cavalier disregard for political norms made him popular as a candidate from the beginning. No matter the damage they cause, Mr. Trump\u2019s divergences from custom are only to support his personal interests.ELIJAH POMERANTZ, 1712th Grade, New Rochelle High School, New Rochelle, N.Y.Growing up a 21st-century overachiever, I\u2019ve constantly heard adults justify my ambition with a \u201cType A\u201d diagnosis. I was deemed \u201chardworking\u201d and \u201ccompetitive\u201d by parents of classmates, who assumed my top marks in fourth-grade spelling were surely associated with \u201csmart-aleck\u201d arrogance. Back then, there were two overarching sorting compartments, Type A and Type B, and you accepted wherever you best fit.Because of a liberal shift, these broad groupings have divided into numerous specific boxes. Be careful \u2014 new personality modifiers can contort your identity like a Twister board. If you spread yourself thin using too many adjectives, the traits lose their meaning. I\u2019m not \u201csmart\u201d; psychoanalysts proclaim I\u2019m an \u201cerudite perfectionist.\u201dWhich is better: asking our next generation of leaders to define themselves given two limited options, or attaching a string of senseless adjectives to them? When can I just be \u201cme\u201d?LAUREN HIRSCHMANN, 1711th Grade, Livingston High School, Livingston, N.J.Mr. Trump has enough power as it is \u2014 citizens need not walk on eggshells to resist his policies and presidency. It is as if there were a bull on a rampage in a china shop, and the shoppers being trampled were told not to make things worse by damaging the merchandise.A democracy is not about carefully self-censored conversations, especially when threatened with authoritarianism. Objecting to Mr. Trump in no uncertain terms is what is called for now. Coddling the provoker-in-chief is not the answer. We must believe that truth and justice will prevail in the free marketplace of ideas. Help us, Free Speech, you\u2019re our only hope!DANTE KIRKMAN, 1610th Grade, Palo Alto Senior High School, Palo Alto, Calif.President Trump is destroying health care for the poor and middle class. He appointed an opponent of public education, Betsy DeVos, to head the Education Department, and she rescinded President Obama\u2019s victim-oriented policies on sexual assault. He may end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He is warmongering over North Korea.But sure, let\u2019s keep focusing on Mr. Trump\u2019s immature Twitter insults. And then let\u2019s wonder why our country is in shambles.HADRIANA LOWENKRON, 1612th Grade, Columbia High School, Maplewood, N.J.It has become an established fact of history that Columbus was a tyrant who arrived on American shores an ungracious beneficiary of Native American generosity, and who quickly and unscrupulously repaid them with enslavement and slaughter. We hailed progress in the renaming of Columbus Day to Indigenous People\u2019s Day across many cities in the United States. Yet even this narrative appears to have been rewritten by some on the far right, who claim that Native Americans are in fact primitive savages deserving of their fates, and Columbus the beacon of Western civilization under assault by liberal lies.I\u2019m left sick to the stomach by just how apparent it is that Americans today dwell in two different sets of realities. More than that, I just feel lost. Why must there be so much hate? Why has mudslinging replaced all semblance of civilized discourse? What is there left to us that won\u2019t be politicized?PATRICK FANG, 1712th Grade, Leigh High School, San Jose, Calif.The G.O.P. called Mr. Obama \u201ckinglike\u201d for his use of executive orders. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has signed nearly double the number of executive orders in the same amount of time with hardly a word from conservative lawmakers. Had Mr. Obama even hinted toward threatening the First Amendment, he would have faced a huge conservative backlash. However, when Mr. Trump directly challenges the Constitution by insinuating that freedom of the press is \u201cdisgusting,\u201d his comments are brushed aside or outright ignored by conservative lawmakers.The reality is that so long as it brings personal benefit, the G.O.P. willingly ignores Mr. Trump\u2019s bigoted behavior and its own hypocrisy, whether it be regarding inflammatory comments or threats toward the Constitution.MAYA GULANI, 1712th Grade, Shaker Heights High School, Shaker Heights, OhioNATALIA PEREZ, 1611th Grade, Guilford High School, Guilford, Conn.Ironically, a week ago I read a controversial article about paying students to motivate them to get decent grades. Now I\u2019m reading this awe-inspiring article about Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist, who would have paid anything just to be able to go school. I believe the article did a superb job at showing how far she\u2019s come on her journey to get educated. She fought to receive a basic education and now she\u2019s attending a prestigious university. Additionally, I thought it was ingenious to include some of Malala\u2019s tweets, like the one in which she inquires about what she should pack for college. It illustrates how she\u2019s just a normal girl, even though she\u2019s the modern-day symbol of women\u2019s education rights.ALISON JANOUSKY, 1712th Grade, West Islip High School, West Islip, N.Y.Roger Cohen bases his opposition to the Catalan independence referendum on respect for the rule of law, drawing parallels between Carles Puigdemont\u2019s drive for a self-governing country and President Trump\u2019s contempt for the Constitution.But the proper parallel is between Mr. Trump and Mariano Rajoy, prime minister of Spain. It is the Spanish government that has used illiberal strongman tactics throughout this affair. Peaceful Catalan voters do not set a frightening precedent; a government that suppresses a popular referendum, and sends in paramilitary police to attack citizens in polling locations, does that.Catalan independence is not a threat to democracy; rabid Spanish nationalism is. Spain forfeited whatever right it had to Catalonia when it criminalized the act of voting itself.CONNOR HARTIGAN, 1611th Grade, Hopkins School, New HavenOLIVIA HAGAN, 1511th Grade, Oceanside High School, Oceanside, N.Y.It\u2019s so counterintuitive that your average pea-brained, memory-deficient goldfish possesses complex emotions. While we melt over the ending of \u201cMarley and Me,\u201d about a family\u2019s dog, rarely do we consider that less personable organisms, those farther out of the domestic sphere, go through the same tribulations that we experience.We assume that dogs who are panting, with tongues out and big smiles, are happy as can be. More faceless creatures like googly-eyed fish are deemed emotionless. That\u2019s just a typical result of our anthropomorphism. This, of course, has ramifications. Saving the cute, cuddly endangered seals garners lots of attention. But I doubt you\u2019ve heard of any World Wildlife Fund campaigns to protect the fabulous green sphinx moth, right?Emotional fish go through clinical depression. All life is complex. These creatures are people, too.SIMON LEVIEN, 1611th Grade, Sparta High School, Sparta, N.J.PERI KESSLER, 1712th Grade, Staples High School, Westport, Conn.Detective Kevin Desormeau\u2019s recent indictment for perjury reveals a sickness at the heart of law enforcement \u2014 the idea that justice is outside the law. This fallacy molds cops\u2019 actions and has transformed American sensibilities. The media we consume reinforces our conceptions. The cops that we see on TV are grizzled, cynical, oftentimes going outside the law, lying and planting evidence, all in an attempt to get the villain and achieve justice. But justice without due process, without witnesses, without a fair trial, is not justice at all. Our flawed thinking creates people like Detective Desormeau; our media reinforces it. The media does not need to stop creating entertaining characters and TV shows; instead, Americans need to accept the idea that real law enforcement is, and should be, boring.ROSS KILPATRICK, 1611th Grade, West High School, Salt Lake CityI am an American teenager who is neither affluent nor economically disadvantaged. I am your everyday brand of adolescent anxiety caused by more than just social media. My generation is affected by more than just swipes and likes on an app. We were born into an era of fear resulting from knowing only the post-9/11 world of constant \u201cwhen will the next one be?\u201d We are all afraid for our futures because of the violent political climate we\u2019re in because of the current president. My generation is the most socially liberal in decades and we hope for a more accepting and tolerant future, but still we are anxious about that future because of Mr. Trump. Our anxiety is about more than just Instagram.CELESTE CHAPMAN, 1712th Grade, Lakeside High School, AtlantaIn the aftermath of yet another sex scandal involving a conservative congressman, I wonder what Tim Murphy, a Republican representative from Pennsylvania, was like as a child. Surely an adult who preaches against abortion but urges his mistress to terminate her pregnancy also hounded his peers to clean up while he dumped out a box of toys and played. Surely an adult who blames staff members for writing his anti-abortion Facebook posts also pointed fingers at a classmate when the teacher asked who left toys on the floor after cleanup time.Our parents teach us to hold ourselves accountable for our mistakes. How can we, the next generation of Americans, grow up to be moral citizens with congressional scandals happening left and right? But we won\u2019t worry too much about Mr. Murphy. While he walks away trying to keep his chin up, we\u2019ll be over here, picking up his toys off the ground.ISABELLE CHIRLS, 1611th Grade, Livingston High School, Livingston, N.J.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Seas Warm, Whales Face New Dangers", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOUNT DESERT ROCK, Me. \u2014 From the top of the six-story lighthouse, water stretches beyond the horizon in every direction. A foghorn bleats twice at 22-second intervals, interrupting the endless chatter of herring gulls.At least twice a day, beginning shortly after dawn, researchers climb steps and ladders and crawl through a modest glass doorway to scan the surrounding sea, looking for the distinctive spout of a whale.This chunk of rock, about 25 nautical miles from Bar Harbor, is part of a global effort to track and learn more about one of the sea\u2019s most majestic and endangered creatures. So far this year, the small number of sightings here have underscored the growing perils along the East Coast to both humpback whales and North Atlantic right whales.This past summer, the numbers of humpback whales identified from the rock were abysmal \u2014 the team saw only eight instead of the usual dozens. Fifty-three humpbacks have died in the last 19 months, many after colliding with boats or fishing gear.Scientists worry that the humpbacks may have been forced elsewhere in a search for food as the seas grow rapidly warmer and their feeding grounds are disturbed.The North Atlantic right whales, which prefer colder waters, are also on a changed course \u2014 with even more dire consequences. Fifteen of the animals have died since mid-April in a population that has now slipped to fewer than 450.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this level of mortality in right whales since we stopped whaling them\u201d in coastal New England in the 1700s, said Dr. Kraus.The aquarium maintains a catalog of images of North Atlantic right whales, in part to track their population levels. The pictures, spanning decades, are crucial to understanding these elusive leviathans..Digital algorithms make identifications a little easier, dividing the photos into categories of fluke patterns, mainly by determining how much of the tail is white or black. But researchers, including Lindsey Jones, a graduate student at the College of the Atlantic, which runs the station, must still look through several thousand images one by one to match by eye.It should be possible to build a better algorithm, but no one in the small, dedicated field of whale research has the funding to pay for one.Luckily, some matches are easy. Researchers on the island see many Gulf of Maine whales often enough that they recognize them on sight.They surrounded the divers and started clicking \u2014 they seemed to be saying hello. Read and then take a swim with whales in a virtual reality feature.Steven Katona, a co-founder of Allied Whale, was one of the first researchers to begin identifying whales here in the 1970s. Dr. Katona and his collaborators took pictures for the humpback whale catalog, which later confirmed their hunches that fluke patterns were consistent across a whale\u2019s lifetime.In 1975, they named one of the first North Atlantic humpbacks na00008, or Number 8. The whale has been spotted three times since: in Canada\u2019s Gulf of St. Lawrence in the 1980s, off the coast of the Dominican Republic in 1993, and earlier this year off the coast of New Jersey.\u201cWe have only a handful of sightings of this whale, yet these link together the efforts of collaborators spanning much of the North Atlantic,\u201d Peter T. Stevick, a senior scientist with the North Atlantic Humpback Whale Catalog, said in an email.The sightings occurred in four distinct humpback habitats, providing insights into where these giants feed, breed and migrate. Another sighting matched a whale in Brazil to one observed in Madagascar \u2014 a distance of about 6,500 miles \u2014 proving that an animal the length of a school bus can travel a quarter of the way around the world.The catalog has also allowed researchers to see that the whales breed at the edge of the Caribbean Sea, then fan out to traditional feeding areas, from the East Coast to Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland and Iceland.Understanding the whales\u2019 behavior remains key to helping them survive in warming waters shared with fishermen and ships, said Judy Allen, associate director of Allied Whale.\u201cThese are animals that are difficult to study,\u201d Ms. Allen said. \u201cThey spend most of their lives underwater. We see a brief glimpse when they lift their tails out of the water and somebody happens to be there with a camera.\u201dRight whales are generally seen in the Gulf of Maine, the coast of the Canadian Maritimes and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the summer. In the winter, pregnant females and others migrate along the Eastern Seaboard to the Southeast.They don\u2019t have distinctive flukes; their bodies are wider, and they\u2019re less graceful than their humpback cousins. So researchers identify them using the pattern of each animal\u2019s \u201ccallosity\u201d \u2014 the roughened skin patches on their heads. Because these formations can only be seen from the top, scientists must use planes and boats to track them.Researchers based on Cape Cod begin flying in the winter months when right whales, which can grow as long as a five-story building, seek out food and social interaction in the waters off Massachusetts. The low-flying plane rides are so dangerous that scientists undergo \u201cdunk training,\u201d learning to survive if the plane drops into the frigid sea, miles from shore.Flying 750 to 1,000 feet over the animals also allows researchers to check on their health, making sure they are not dragging fishing ropes or bearing new scars, said Charles \u201cStormy\u201d Mayo, director of the Right Whale Ecology Program at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass.Right whales are baleen whales, so they filter feed, supporting their 70-ton weight \u2014 nearly as much as the Space Shuttle \u2014 solely with microscopic animals called zooplankton. That search can push whales into shipping lanes, where the animals are sometimes struck, or into the gear of fishing boats.Despite federal protection efforts, about 80 percent of right whales bear scars from past entanglements or ship strikes. \u201cThey are remarkably built for a life in an ocean, which unfortunately is changing,\u201d Dr. Mayo said. He worries that \u201cthey\u2019re not finding what they need where they ought to.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a perilous place to live, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he added.Cape Cod Bay, one of the first places that right whales were hunted \u2014 eventually nearly to extinction \u2014 is now a favorite hangout.. After routinely seeing up to 100 per winter field season, researchers have cataloged 200 to 300 most years since 2009, Dr. Mayo said.Researchers at the Center for Coastal Studies are now trying to determine how plankton levels, temperature, currents, and salinity might affect the whales\u2019 movements.It\u2019s not even clear how right whales find their food. Christy Hudak, a research associate at the center, said she thinks the whales probably use a combination of senses.Amateurs also participate in whale catalogs, both to help researchers and for their own pleasure.\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to see that [each whale] is an individual with a life history and a group of offspring, like us,\u201d Ms. McCullough said.He lets people know when a whale they once photographed has been sighted again. In the two years he\u2019s been collecting images, 1,400 people have submitted more than 60,000 shots of more than 10,000 identifiable whales.\u201cThe vision is that it becomes a regular thing that people understand these whales are out there, they are to be respected and valued and really appreciated,\u201d said Dr. Cheeseman, a wildlife photographer and safari company operator.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few cases of, \u2018Hey, this known whale is entangled.\u2019 People react very differently when it\u2019s \u2018my\u2019 whale.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Self-Absorption on War Deaths", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump was right about one thing this week (look, it happens). It is extremely hard to tell someone that their husband or wife or son or daughter has been killed while fighting in the country\u2019s uniform.Well, it should be. Every service member who dies in one of America\u2019s wars gives up his life in following the orders of the commander -n chief. And that commander in chief \u2014 no matter how self-absorbed \u2014 should take personal responsibility for it.Then again, there was so much wrong with the way he handled this issue.First, he indicated he had not already made the calls. \u201cI will at some point during the period of time,\u201d he said. Which period of time? Who knows.Then, in true Trump fashion, he made it all about the most important person in any conversation, himself. Saying that those notifications are \u201ca very difficult thing,\u201d the president started whining, \u201cNow it gets to a point where you make four or five of them in one day, it\u2019s a very, very tough day.\u201dImagine having to sacrifice time from tweeting inanities, stealing health insurance coverage from working Americans, passing tax breaks for his fellow billionaires, and other really pressing stuff.Then, still true to form, Trump tried to make the claim that he was actually much better at this solemn duty than anyone else, especially Barack Obama.\u201cIf you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn\u2019t make calls, a lot of them didn\u2019t make calls,\u201d he said, absolutely falsely. \u201cI like to call when it\u2019s appropriate, when I think I\u2019m able to do it.\u201dTrump admitted under further questioning at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden that he didn\u2019t actually know what Barack Obama\u2019s practice was. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he did it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was told that he didn\u2019t often.\u201d In fact, Obama frequently made calls, always wrote letters and regularly met with Gold Star families.Today, in an interview with a Fox radio host, Trump actually dragged in the 2010 battlefield death of Second Lt. Robert Kelly, the son of Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John Kelly. \u201cI mean, you could ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama,\u201d Trump said.(By the way, Trump\u2019s endless need to bring up Obama all the time is passing strange. Is this president ever going to become anything than merely the Bizarro Obama?)The issue here, as Trump likes to say about the playing of the national anthem at football games, is one of respect and honor. In the culture of the military, a job in which the possibility of dying is ever-present, the proper way to treat death is with dignity and respect. And the commander in chief should take personal responsibility.President George W. Bush tried to hide the casualties of war from the American public by barring the media from Dover Air Force Base when flag-draped coffins returned from Iraq. He did not attend the funerals of the fallen.Trump, by contrast, sat joking with Sean Hannity at an event in Harrisburg, Pa., last week, while the military color guard was lowering the flag to the playing of \u201cRetreat\u201d \u2014 a deeply solemn daily ritual.\u201cWhat a nice sound that is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAre they playing that for you or for me?\u201dI don\u2019t mean to suggest that Trump is so lacking in basic empathy that he doesn\u2019t care about the war dead. But he is careless, in exactly the way that F. Scott Fitzgerald described two of the main characters in \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d:\u201cThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy \u2014 they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aussie Rules: Readers Respond", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 29______Some of you, of course, focused on my lead anecdote involving kangaroos and the family that was feeding them white bread (yes, we know, it\u2019s bad for the animals).Others replied with stories of their own about Australia\u2019s relationship to rules, many of which made us smile and think even more deeply about how this country works \u2014 which is exactly what we\u2019d hoped for, and what we always appreciate here in the Australia bureau.Here are a few of the more memorable replies, lightly edited for space and clarity, followed by a roundup of Times stories we love and a recommendation for those who might be wondering what to do with their lives.Our society is, in my opinion, well above average when it comes to rigidity compared to other Western democracies. We set rules and associated punishments for any wrongdoing we can predict.You only have to look at driving signs in Sydney to see that. It takes a minute to read them. I think it might even be illegal to read them, such are the risks to your health and other road users\u2019 health.Who decides the rules, and who are the \u2018risky\u2019 subjects? You mentioned those of overseas cultures, but I would add Indigenous Australians and drug addicts to the mix. So often rules are made that make middle-class mums and dads feel safer and more assured, even though they and their families were rarely, if ever, affected by the activities the rules limit or outlaw.\u2014 Ned CooperI\u2019m really surprised at your impression re. rule breakers versus rule followers. I break every rule under the sun, have done so all my life (I\u2019m 66) and I think that pretty much all my peers do the same. So I guess it\u2019s a matter of perception.\u2014 Neil BoltonI had a two-month job as a visiting professor in the United States a couple of years back. The rules to get in for a non-American were astounding. As as woman of more than 70 years I had to insure myself against pregnancy, among other things, in order to be approved. I raised this as a patent absurdity and was told, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not discrimination, men have to get the same insurance.The rule under no condition could be waived.\u2014 Bronwyn DaviesI\u2019m Australian and I\u2019ve lived in Sydney for all 27 years of my life, though I like to think I am well traveled \u2014 don\u2019t we all? I\u2019m also a lawyer.The reason Australians are sticklers for the rules, and the reason they are so hesitant to stray, is that they absolutely abhor the concept of personal responsibility in a way few other countries do.If something goes wrong, it\u2019s not the person\u2019s fault. Rather, it\u2019s that the regulatory framework for that arena of human behavior isn\u2019t effective enough. More laws! Won\u2019t someone please think of the children.The best example I can think of was when, following a drunken man drowning in Circular Quay, the government proposed a fence. People actually agreed! Because of one drunk man. More mundane examples abound.It is, in my opinion, one of the more distasteful aspects of Australian society.\u2014 Thomas WilsonI was in the butterfly house at the Melbourne Zoo with my daughter a few months ago admiring the elegant little creatures as they landed on the arms and shoulders of visitors. The beautiful delicate wings so full of colour when all of a sudden an Indian man grabbed a butterfly by the wings and starting waving the poor creature in front of his elderly mother\u2019s face.Maybe she was blind and he was just trying to let her see it close up but before I knew it I was saying \u201cNO, NO, you cannot do that. You will hurt the poor creature.\u201d Of course they didn\u2019t really understand English that well so just thought I was scared of the butterfly until I started waving my finger disapprovingly like a butterfly lover in distress.Afterward I did feel really bad, I felt terrible for making someone feel bad when they were just appreciating nature\u2019s wonders, especially a visitor. Maybe it was the closet zoologist in me, who completed the degree but never worked a day in the field, trying to do my bit for animal conservation.I found myself being extra polite as we passed each other many more times in the tight confines of an overcrowded butterfly house, insisting the elderly mother go before me as we both approached the exit.I think next time I\u2019ll try to resist the impulse and leave it to natural selection; the butterfly did fly off unharmed of course.Whilst I completely agree that some \u201crules\u201d need to be modernised, such as marriage equality, some rules shouldn\u2019t, like don\u2019t grab a butterfly wings! Which at the end of the day is exactly the same thing \u2026 freedom.\u2014 Patricia ChircopI think your daughter was right.You should have, with the greatest of courtesy, drawn their attention to the \u201cno feeding\u201d rule. If they had been reasonable people they would have been grateful to you for pointing it out.Speaking as a long-term immigrant to Britain, I can say through personal experience that often it is not a case of (usually newly arrived) immigrants not following the rules. It\u2019s a case of not knowing what the rules are: standing in a queue, not throwing litter out of a car, not interrupting while someone is speaking, remembering to top and tail requests with \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201dIt is not that we have some fundamental objection to doing (or not doing) these things: It\u2019s more that often we don\u2019t know what needs to be done. Somebody please tell us \u2014 we want to learn, and through learning save ourselves some embarrassment!\u2014 Vani K. BorooahAnother interesting quandary I have encountered in my career as a teacher is of migrant families requesting a school for a white Australian blue-eyed blonde teacher for their child over a \u201cbrown\u201d teacher \u2014 it makes for a proud display of the class photo to relatives back home, signaling they have finally \u201carrived\u201d in Australia and raising their prestige in society.Would this classify as a hangover of colonization, discrimination or market forces in the independent education sector, where if you are paying exorbitant school fees you can bend the rules to get what you want?\u2014 Ipshita NairIn not calling someone out on breaking the rules, it\u2019s because it\u2019s much less hassle and it\u2019s being \u201ctoo serious\u201d and the rule being broken is \u201charmless.\u201dIt\u2019s just bread. It\u2019s just food. It\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just a couple of kilometers over the limit, it\u2019s just some paper with your name signed on it and a label of \u201cmarried.\u201dThis extends from all manner of interpersonal interaction on the social and professional level all the way into our politicians \u2014 who are too busy calling each other names for a laugh than being serious for five minutes.The problem is, we don\u2019t really draw a line.That\u2019s because we can\u2019t help but want to fit into the way our society runs \u2014 the casual, hands-off, \u201cnah, she\u2019ll be right mate\u201d approach to everything that is so deeply ingrained in our culture that we struggle to care enough to change anything for fear of being called out \u2014 not for breaking the rules, but for disturbing the peaceful, carefree status quo we\u2019ve established.\u2014 David TillettI am not suggesting that we become a nation of rule breakers but Australia is truly a \u201cCompliance Nation\u201d progressively getting worse.

{"Headline": "Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s Fed Puerto Rico, and May Change How Aid Is Given", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s was walking along a dark street in a stained T-shirt and a ball cap, trying to decompress after another day of feeding an island that has been largely without electricity since Hurricane Maria hit a month ago.He\u2019d gone barely half a block before two women ran over to snag a selfie. A man shouted out his name from a bar running on a generator and offered to buy him a rum sour.The reaction is more subdued in rural mountain communities like Naguabo, where Mr. Andr\u00e9s and his crew have been delivering supplies so cooks at a small Pentecostal church can make 5,000 servings of arroz con pollo and carne guisada every day. There, people touch his sleeve and whisper, \u201cGracias.\u201d They surround him and pray.\u201cHe\u2019s much more than a hero,\u201d said Jesus R. Rivera, who was inside a cigar store watching Mr. Andr\u00e9s pick out one of his daily smokes. \u201cThe situation is that still some people don\u2019t even have food. He is all that is keeping them from starving.\u201d\u201cEvery day I have this personal anxiety inside,\u201d Mr. Andr\u00e9s said during a Jeep ride through the countryside in late October. \u201cWe only came here to try to help a few thousand because nobody had a plan to feed Puerto Rico, and we opened the biggest restaurant in the world in a week. That\u2019s how crazy this is.\u201dSince he hit the ground five days after the hurricane devastated this island of 3.4 million on Sept. 20, he has built a network of kitchens, supply chains and delivery services that as of Monday had served more than 2.2 million warm meals and sandwiches. No other single agency \u2014 not the Red Cross, the Salvation Army nor any government entity \u2014 has fed more people freshly cooked food since the hurricane, or done it in such a nurturing way.Mr. Andr\u00e9s\u2019s effort, by all accounts the largest emergency feeding program ever set up by a group of chefs, has started winding down. But it illustrates in dramatic fashion the rise of chefs as valuable players in a realm traditionally left to more-established aid organizations.With an ability to network quickly, organize kitchens in difficult circumstances and marshal raw ingredients and equipment, chef-led groups are creating a model for a more agile, local response to catastrophes.In addition to sending money or showing up to hand out blankets or boxes of food, companies like UPS and IBM are designing ways to quickly supply logistical and technical aid.\u201cChefs are part of that trend now, too,\u201d Mr. Ottenhoff said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to say, \u2018Look, people are in need of not just food but good food, and we know how to serve large quantities of good food very quickly.\u2019\u201dRestaurateurs have long offered food when trouble hit their communities.But nothing prepared Mr. Andr\u00e9s for what he faced in Puerto Rico. After taking one of the first commercial flights to the island after the storm, he realized that things were worse than anyone knew.\u201cWe decided we would just start cooking,\u201d Mr. Enrique said.The next morning, Mr. Andr\u00e9s went to a food distributor and loaded up his car. \u201cI was already smart enough to know I would need aluminum pans, so I bought every aluminum pan I could,\u201d he said.They began cooking big pots of the classic island stew called sancocho on the street in front of Mr. Enrique\u2019s small restaurant. Word spread and the lines grew. They sent food to people waiting in 10-hour lines at gas stations. They heard that workers at the city\u2019s biggest medical clinic were going hungry, so they added it to what was now a makeshift delivery schedule. \u201cEvery day it would just double,\u201d Mr. Enrique said.Mr. Andr\u00e9s didn\u2019t realize that his was the biggest hot-food game on the island until a week or so after they started. Someone from the Salvation Army pulled up and asked for 120 meals.\u201cIn my life I never expected the Salvation Army to be asking me for food,\u201d he said. \u201cIf one of the biggest NGOs comes to us for food, who is actually going to be feeding Puerto Rico? We are. We are it.\u201dMore cooks arrived to help. Partnerships were forged with other aid groups and large food companies. Sandwiches and fruit were added to their repertory of rice dishes.The team moved its base of operation to the island\u2019s largest arena. To pay for it all, at least in the beginning, they used Mr. Andr\u00e9s\u2019s credit cards, or cash from the pockets of the Orvis fly-fishing vest he wore like a battle jacket.Mr. Andr\u00e9s left the island only a few times, the first after 11 days on the ground. He had lost 25 pounds and became dehydrated.With limited ability to communicate, the crew organized everything with satellite phones, WhatsApp and a big paper map of all the feeding stations on the island, which Mr. Andr\u00e9s carried like a general at war.He negotiated with a chain of vocational schools around the island to let culinary students cook there. During visits to his kitchens, 18 in all, he admonished volunteers to add more mayonnaise to sandwiches, keep the temperature up on the pans of rice or serve bigger portions.The operation grew so big that at one point you couldn\u2019t find any sliced cheese in all of Puerto Rico. The team had bought it all up for sandwiches.Eventually, the effort would cost World Central Kitchen about $400,000 a day, paid for by donations from foundations, celebrities and a flood of smaller donors, as well as two Federal Emergency Management Agency contracts \u2014 one early on to cover the cost of 140,000 meals, and another for $10 million to cover two weeks\u2019 worth of meals while Mr. Andr\u00e9s\u2019s team scaled down the operation.Mr. Andr\u00e9s, who often rolls right over regulations and ignores the word \u201cno,\u201d clashed more than once with FEMA and other large organizations that have a more-seasoned and methodical approach. In meetings and telephone calls, FEMA officials reminded him that he and his people lacked the experience needed to organize a mass emergency feeding operation, he said.\u201cWe are not perfect, but that doesn\u2019t mean the government is perfect,\u201d Mr. Andr\u00e9s said. \u201cI am doing it without red tape and 100 meetings.\u201dFEMA officials contacted for this article were quick to point out that many other groups and agencies besides World Central Kitchen were feeding Puerto Rico; a spokesman would not publicly discuss Mr. Andr\u00e9s or his operation.Late last week, the system that was serving more than 130,000 meals a day became much smaller. A core crew will most likely keep things going until Thanksgiving, with one main kitchen and a handful in some of the neediest regions.Mr. Andr\u00e9s flew home to Washington, D.C., on Thursday. \u201cThis has been like my little Vietnam, but now I need to go back to normal life,\u201d he said.He never intended to stay as long as he did, he said. Or to feed an island.\u201cAt the end, I couldn\u2019t forgive myself if I didn\u2019t try to do what I thought was right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to think less sometimes and dream less and just make it happen.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of meals that Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\u2019s operation was serving late last week. It was more than 130,000, not 13,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If You Missed Diwali in India, Dallas Is the Place to Be", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDALLAS \u2014 Two weeks after the close of the State Fair of Texas, with the smells of deep-fried Oreos and funnel cake still lingering in the air, 60,000 Indian-Americans from across the country are expected to descend on the same site this Saturday to observe Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights and one of India\u2019s most important holidays.Dallas is not the most obvious setting. Though the city and its surrounding area have one of the nation\u2019s largest Indian populations (108,000 in the 2010 census), the Chicago region\u2019s is nearly twice that size, and the New York-New Jersey area\u2019s is more than five times as large. The Dallas festival doesn\u2019t even take place on Diwali (Oct. 19 this year) because the state fair is using the fairgrounds then.But for those who attend the Dallas mela, Nov. 4 may as well be the official holiday. What brings them here is the sheer scope and Technicolor splash of the spectacle: Bollywood singers are flown in from India. A cast of 150 volunteers stages a production of the Ramlila (a re-enactment of the Ramayana, the Hindu epic). Three giant burning effigies of the 10-headed Hindu villain Ravana and his family crackle into the night, and hundreds of cooks fry up syrupy, spice-laced Indian sweets.This year\u2019s festival will have a slightly different tone than in years past, coming so soon after Hurricane Harvey, which devastated much of Houston and other parts of southeastern Texas. Organizers are expecting a sizable contingent from Houston\u2019s large Indian community to travel more than 200 miles to Dallas, in part because Houston\u2019s Diwali celebration on Oct. 7 was smaller this year in the wake of the floods.This means, too, that the coming event could be the largest in the history of the city\u2019s festival.One of its central components \u2014 and the backdrop to every other activity at the mela \u2014 is the dizzying array of foods, with special care taken to make sure that every region\u2019s Diwali-specific treats are represented. This multicultural spirit is what sets the Dallas mela apart from those in other cities.\u201cIn a single festival, you can eat Gujarati snacks while listening to performances in Tamil, and watching South Indian dance,\u201d said Kalpana Fruitwala, an organizer.For the event, Subash Chander, the owner of the popular Bombay Sweets & Snacks in suburban Irving, creates a pack of Bengali mithai, milk- and nut-based sweets. It includes neon-pink chum chum (coconut-coated milk solids), and gulab jamun (syrup-soaked balls of deep-fried batter) filled with a silky mixture of cream and ground almonds.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Chander was deeply concentrating on an enormous mixing bowl heated to exactly 450 degrees, making sure the milk and shredded coconut for the chum chum were being churned to the ideal softness. If the temperature rises even a few degrees, or the mixture is stirred for too long, he said, the treat loses its luxurious, slightly bouncy texture.\u201cYou have to be very patient,\u201d Mr. Chander said. \u201cOnly after 18 years have I figured out the secret to making chum chum this soft.\u201dThe response at the festival makes all the care worthwhile. \u201cAll night, we have this big line that wraps around many times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt got so long that the organizers had to install stands for people to wait.\u201d\u201cWe want to create an environment like the street markets in Bombay,\u201d Mr. Sukkagopal said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be yelling and shouting about our food. People will be crowding around. It\u2019s a sensory experience.\u201dTesting the recipe in the restaurant\u2019s kitchen, a cook tossed in just-fried cashews and raisins into a bubbling stainless steel vat filled with milk and vermicelli noodles, to add richness and crunch.\u201cWe make it because it is made especially for Diwali in certain places,\u201d Mr. Naga said, adding with a laugh, \u201cThe only disadvantage of payasam is that because it\u2019s more of a liquid, people have a hard time walking around the festival with it.\u201dThe Dallas celebration has come a long way since 1994, when it began as a house party with about 50 guests, bootleg fireworks and catered food at Mr. Gupta\u2019s home in North Dallas.When the party started to outgrow his backyard, Mr. Gupta came up with the idea to turn it into a public, community-run mela, a type of traditional festival with food and music that occurs in every village throughout India during Diwali. \u201cWe wanted to bring that flavor of home to Dallas, to give our children a closer connection to Indian culture,\u201d he said.For the inaugural mela in 2006, Mr. Gupta ambitiously decided to book Texas Stadium in Irving. \u201cEveryone was making fun of us,\u201d said R.K. Panditi, a festival organizer who oversees the food vendors. \u201cWe knew we wouldn\u2019t fill it, but I thought maybe we\u2019ll get 15,000.\u201dMore than 38,000 people showed up, creating a major traffic jam on the freeway, and an hourlong wait just to enter the stadium. The food ran out within the first hour, so Mr. Panditi had to ask two nearby Indian restaurants to stay open until 4 a.m. to feed the crowds.Since 2011, the festival has taken place in the Cotton Bowl, which has a capacity of nearly 100,000, and the added allure of being a citywide landmark and the site of the state fair.On Saturday, vendors will arrive at the Cotton Bowl at 10 a.m. and not leave until well after midnight, when stalls once loaded with chum chum and biryani have been completely emptied of their goods.Staying until the very end is well worth it, though, as the closing event of the mela is an impressive display of fireworks shaped like diyas (lamps, a symbol of Diwali), synchronized to a colorful laser show and Bollywood music \u2014 a favorite tradition of Mr. Gupta\u2019s ever since that first house party.\u201cWithout the fireworks,\u201d he said, a sparkle in his eye, \u201cthere is no Diwali.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Another man in the car, Timothy Grimes, outran his pursuers. But they caught and savagely beat the third black man, Cedric Sandiford, 36, with a baseball bat, a tire iron and a tree limb.\u201cMy God, I have a son like you, 17 years old,\u201d Mr. Sandiford was said to have begged. \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me.\u201dThe attack inflamed simmering tensions between blacks and whites in New York City; sparked angry marches by protesters, who were met by local residents outraged in turn at being tarred as bigots; and, with the case drawing worldwide attention, transformed predominantly white Howard Beach into a metonym for racial hatred.Mayor Edward I. Koch compared the attack to a lynching.After one participant testified for the prosecution, Mr. Lester, who had pleaded not guilty, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault. He was sentenced in 1988 to the maximum prison term, 10 to 30 years. Two others were convicted of manslaughter as well.In state prison, Mr. Lester earned a general equivalency diploma and an associate college degree in business administration. He learned to play the guitar and composed an ode to Mr. Griffith\u2019s mother.In 2001, grown by then to 5 feet 10 inches tall and 170 pounds, Mr. Lester was paroled and deported back to Britain, where he had lived until he was 14 before immigrating to the United States with his siblings, mother and stepfather.In England he moved in briefly with his father, who had remained there after the others left for New York. He got a menial factory job, earned a degree in engineering and started his own electrical services company. He went on to live with a woman in Ashton-Under-Lyne, a town on the River Tame in Greater Manchester, and had three children with her.Mr. Lester died on Aug. 14. Though the Coroners Service for the Manchester South District said on Monday that the cause was still under investigation, the family said it was suicide. Mr. Lester was 48.\u201cHe suffered from depression due to the fact that he was wrongly convicted,\u201d his sister Jayne Lester said in a telephone interview from Florida, where she lives. \u201cHe was just tormented.

But he did not chase Mr. Griffith onto the highway, he told The Daily News in 1996, and was unaware while pursuing Mr. Sandiford that Mr. Griffith had been struck by a car.He added, however: \u201cI accept responsibility for Michael Griffith\u2019s death. If we hadn\u2019t chased him, he wouldn\u2019t have died.\u201dCharles J. Hynes, the special prosecutor in the case, rejected Mr. Lester\u2019s version of events and expressed dismay at his release from prison after he had been rejected four times for parole.\u201cJon Lester can try and rewrite history all he wants,\u201d Mr. Hynes wrote in an email on Monday. \u201cSome would say 15 years\u2019 imprisonment is significant punishment, but after 15 years he was alive, and Michael Griffith is dead.\u201dDuring those 15 years, mostly at Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison near Buffalo, and the Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, N.Y., in Sullivan County, Mr. Lester studied and counseled other prisoners on anger management.In jailhouse interviews and shortly after his release, he insisted that he had never been a racist and expressed regret for the attack, something the sentencing judge said he had failed to do after his conviction.\u201cI was just a typical cocky teenager who got involved in a situation which I couldn\u2019t control,\u201d he told the British newspaper The Sunday Mirror in 2001.\u201cI\u2019m not that baby-faced thug anymore,\u201d he told The Daily News.\u201cI\u2019m responsible for someone being dead,\u201d he said in an interview with The Times Herald-Record of Middletown, N.Y. \u201cI can never undo that, and I will live with it every day forever.\u201dMr. Lester remembered reading that Mr. Griffith had two sisters.\u201cI have two sisters,\u201d he told The News. \u201cIt was Christmas week. I thought I had ruined Christmas. I had probably ruined Christmas forever. I had probably ruined Christmas for the Griffith family forever, too.\u201dHe emerged from prison scarred from fights with fellow inmates, who he said had attacked him, and armed with a business degree, which he had earned from Sullivan County Community College with a straight-A average. He had also recovered from Crohn\u2019s disease, a bowel disorder that required several operations.After returning to England, he attended Stockport College in Manchester before starting his electrical services business.\u201cIn his last days he was a successful and caring businessman with a high degree of integrity who tried to live his life and give back to society,\u201d his sister Jayne Lester said. \u201cHe always regarded the Howard Beach case as a huge tragedy to everyone involved.\u201dShe added, \u201cThe fact that he couldn\u2019t come back to America is basically what killed him, because he couldn\u2019t be with his family.\u201dMr. Lester\u2019s family did not publish an obituary; his sister announced the death on Facebook. Among those who expressed condolences online was Victoria Gotti, a former neighbor and the daughter of the deceased Mafia boss John Gotti.Ms. Lester said she had returned from England a few weeks ago with her brother\u2019s ashes.\u201cAt last,\u201d she wrote, \u201che will be at rest in the U.S.A. Where his heart was and always wanted to be.\u201dJack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

Investigators found her body facedown in the freezer on Sept. 10.On Friday, the Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office said the cause of her death was hypothermia and the combination of alcohol and topiramate \u2014 a prescription drug used to prevent migraines and to control seizures \u2014 were \u201csignificant contributing factors.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, the Rosemont Police Department said \u201cno sign of foul play appears to exist\u201d but that its investigation was not yet over.A spokesman for the hotel, Jim Martinez, said in a statement that the report \u201cmust be confusing and difficult for all who knew her.\u201d\u201cHer death has stunned our company and saddened employees,\u201d he said, adding that the hotel would \u201cpreserve all the evidence they requested, including video recordings and documents.\u201dA lawyer for Ms. Martin, Larry R. Rogers Jr., said in an email he was conducting an independent investigation. He said his law firm was seeking answers to several questions, including why the hotel \u201crefused repeated requests to review available security camera footage\u201d after Ms. Jenkins went missing and why \u201can empty and unused freezer in the back of this abandoned unused kitchen was on and operating and accessible.\u201dSecurity camera footage showed Ms. Jenkins entering the hotel\u2019s kitchen at about 3:30 a.m. on Sept. 9. There is no footage of her entering the freezer because none of the cameras showed the doors to the cooler that housed the freezer, officials said.The temperature in the freezer was recorded at 10 degrees during an investigation by the medical examiner\u2019s office.Investigators tested for hundreds of drugs, including date rape drugs, and did not find any. They found a blood alcohol concentration of 0.112. It is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level of .08 or more.Officials said they had found topiramate in her system that fell \u201cwithin the appropriate prescribed levels\u201d that are used to treat conditions like migraines. The medical examiner\u2019s office, citing information from Ms. Jenkins\u2019s family, said she had not been prescribed topiramate.When alcohol and topiramate are combined, the effects of each can be enhanced. The medical examiner\u2019s office said that these substances, combined with the exposure to the cold, could \u201chasten the onset of hypothermia and death.\u201dThere was no evidence that Ms. Jenkins was forced to consume either the alcohol or topiramate, officials said.Jacey Fortin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Executives Are Contrite About Election Meddling, but Make Few Promises on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter appeared on Capitol Hill for the first time on Tuesday to publicly acknowledge their role in Russia\u2019s influence on the presidential campaign, but offered little more than promises to do better. Their reluctance frustrated lawmakers who sought stronger evidence that American elections will be protected from foreign powers.The hearing, the first of three in two days for company executives, served as an initial public reckoning for the internet giants. They had emphasized their role as public squares for political discourse but are being forced to confront how they were used as tools for a broad Russian misinformation campaign.Both Democrats and some Republicans on a Senate Judiciary subcommittee complained that the companies had waited nearly a year to publicly admit how many Americans were exposed to the Russian effort to spread propaganda during the 2016 campaign. Senators pushed for harsher remedies, including regulations on their advertising practices akin to rules for political advertising on television.\u201cWhy has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is and begin to work in a responsible legislative way to address it?\u201d asked Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware.Since then, the company has scrambled to appease lawmakers by promising to hire more than 1,000 people to manually review political ad purchases and to make public the funding behind those ads.\u201cThe foreign interference we saw was reprehensible,\u201d Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, told senators.The companies also acknowledged that they were struggling to keep up with the threat of foreign interference.\u201cThe abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us \u2014 and one that we are determined to meet,\u201d said Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett.At the heart of the companies\u2019 problems are business models that reward viral content \u2014 which can include misinformation \u2014 and an enormous advertising business that is automated and unable to easily spot ads purchased by foreign governments.In a sign of the shifting political winds for tech giants, Republicans, who have been more restrained in their criticism of the companies, were more skeptical on Tuesday. In one contentious exchange, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed Mr. Stretch on whether Facebook could possibly police all of its advertisers.\u201cI\u2019m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don\u2019t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?\u201dMr. Stretch acknowledged that Facebook could not track all those advertisers.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the chairman of the crime and terrorism subcommittee that held the hearing, said the risk went beyond Russia to other American adversaries. Talking to reporters afterward, he alluded to potential regulation of political advertising online.\u201cIt\u2019s Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cWhat we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.\u201dFacebook, Twitter and Google have not publicly opposed a bipartisan proposal to require reports on who funds political ads online, similar to rules for broadcast television. In private, their lobbyists have praised voluntary efforts to disclose political ad funding and have resisted many aspects of the bill.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the legislation was essential before the midterm elections in 2018.\u201cOur midterms are 370 days away, and we don\u2019t have time to mess around with dialogue anymore,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview after the hearing. Ms. Klobuchar introduced the bill with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.During the hearing, some Republicans also sought to play down the Russian effort to tip the election in favor of President Trump, stressing incorrectly that the Kremlin\u2019s agents did not favor a particular presidential candidate in last year\u2019s election.\u201cRussia does not have loyalty to a political party in the United States,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cTheir goal is to divide us and discredit our democracy.\u201dMr. Graham asked Mr. Stretch of Facebook to confirm that the pattern of activity the site saw from Russia was more focused on sowing chaos in the United States than in bolstering Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201cDuring the election, they were trying to create discord between Americans, most of it directed against Clinton,\u201d Mr. Graham said, addressing Mr. Stretch. \u201cAfter the election, you saw Russian-tied groups and organizations trying to undermine President Trump\u2019s legitimacy. Is that what you saw on Facebook?\u201dMr. Stretch agreed. But the question was narrowly tailored, apparently intended to distance the broader Russian interference from the backing of Mr. Trump.Though the companies promised to work with government officials, Mr. Stretch stopped short of agreeing to some suggestions.In one heated exchange, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him to reject political ad purchases in foreign currencies.\u201cHow did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?\u201d Mr. Franken said.But Mr. Stretch hemmed, saying the rejection of a foreign currency to buy political ads would not solve the problem of foreign interference.\u201cThe reason I\u2019m hesitating on foreign currency is it\u2019s relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies,\u201d Mr. Stretch said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a signal, but not enough.\u201dThat response failed to satisfy Mr. Franken, who interrupted with exasperation.\u201cMy goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better,\u201d Mr. Franken said, raising his voice.This week, the companies admitted that the abuse of their platforms was much greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to Facebook\u2019s admission, Google said that agents who were also from the Internet Research Agency uploaded more than 1,000 videos on its YouTube platform. Twitter said the agency published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter.On Wednesday, the top lawyers for all three companies will appear before the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are conducting their own investigations into the Russian election meddling.Tuesday\u2019s hearing exposed a much deeper struggle for Facebook, which is trying to tread a delicate line as a technology platform while also fighting against hate speech, violence and misinformation on its site.\u201cI like that they are contrite, but these issues are existential and they aren\u2019t taking any structural changes,\u201d said Tim Wu, a professor of law at Columbia University. \u201cThese are Band-Aids.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Facebook, Hand-Wringing Over a Fix for Fake Content", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was an important moment for the 33-year-old chief executive of the social media company. He was promoting Facebook Groups, a product that millions of people on Facebook used to talk about shared interests, debate, discuss and maybe debate some more.This type of activity, he believed, was one of the keys to his sprawling company\u2019s future. The goal of Facebook, he told his audience, which included many Groups leaders, was to \u201cgive people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\u201dNow there is an ongoing debate among Facebook employees over how to handle this so-called organic content, or posts from users that are not advertisements and can be freely shared across Facebook, according to a dozen current and former Facebook employees. These people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were prohibited by nondisclosure agreements from talking about the company.On one side are employees who idealize Facebook\u2019s lofty goals of unfettered speech and do not think the company should be in the business of censoring what its users have to say. On the other side are workers who worry that the company\u2019s hands-off approach has already caused problems \u2014 ones that will grow worse if nothing is done.\u201cThe algorithms Facebook sets up that prioritize and control what\u2019s shown in its powerful newsfeed are a lot more consequential than the ads,\u201d said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who closely follows social media and technology. \u201cThe company seems stuck between exercising this massive power as it wishes, but also terrified about the conversation about its power and how to handle it.\u201dBut misleading ads were often a small component of the misinformation campaign.Investigators believe the Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm that has been linked to the Kremlin, amassed enormous followings for various Facebook Pages that masqueraded as destinations for discussion about all sorts of issues, from the Black Lives Matter movement to gun ownership.Aided by Facebook\u2019s finely tuned ad-targeting tools, the Russian firm would pay to place posts in the News Feeds of users. The ad product, called a \u201cpromoted post,\u201d was designed to look little different than the rest of the content flowing through the News Feed.Users who responded in a positive manner to the advertisements were prompted to subscribe to related Facebook Pages or Groups run by the Russians. If they did, it meant that nonpaid, \u201corganic\u201d posts would begin to appear in the users\u2019 News Feeds. From there they spread, being shared and reshared among the user\u2019s network of friends.Facebook is not the only big internet company wrestling with the issue. But at Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s company, the issue has been particularly troublesome, given how easy it is to spread messages to tens of millions of Facebook users.Whether something is removed from Facebook is often dictated by its terms of service, which define standards of behavior on the network. Those standards prohibit posting nudity and threats of violence. But misleading users \u2014 even outright lying \u2014 aren\u2019t necessarily against the rules. And that\u2019s hard to police.So far, Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity and identity on the platform. Facebook removed hundreds of ads last month, not because of the content they contained, but because the Russians running the pages did not disclose their real identities.\u201cWe want people to be able to come to Facebook to talk about issues of public interest, and we know that means people will sometimes disagree and the issues they discuss will sometimes be controversial,\u201d Monika Bickert, head of product policy and counterterrorism at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s O.K. But it\u2019s important to us that these conversations happen in an authentic way, meaning we have to be speaking as ourselves, with our real identities.\u201dFacebook has said little publicly about the situation but there is intensifying pressure to respond.One of the solutions discussed internally at Facebook has been \u201cwhitelisting,\u201d in which algorithms would decide which content makers would be allowed to publish or advertise on Facebook, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s internal deliberations. They have also discussed \u201cblacklisting,\u201d in which the algorithms would decide which content makers could not post.But in closed-door meetings at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in Washington, Facebook employees have expressed concern that such a move could have effects on other publications and content makers that are not spreading false or divisive news.Others worry that acting too hastily could establish precedents that would lead to a situation, for example, where human rights activists using Facebook to coordinate protests in Syria would be forced to identify themselves. They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries.As for a technical solution, some hope artificial intelligence can help Facebook sift fact from fiction. But today\u2019s A.I. technology is not advanced enough to do the work on its own.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s solution is to double down on his community concept. He has said publicly that strengthening social bonds on Facebook will lead to a positive outcome, despite whatever reservations his employees and the general public may have.\u201cEvery day, I say to myself, \u2018I don\u2019t have much time here on Earth, how can I make the greatest positive impact?\u2019 Some nights I go to bed and I\u2019m not sure I made the right choices that day,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said at the June conference. \u201cI can tell you, those doubts don\u2019t go away, no matter who you are. But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better.\u201dFollow Mike Isaac on Twitter @MikeIsaacNicole Perlroth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \u201ccognitive diversity\u201d is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of \u2014 individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won\u2019t do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies.

It\u2019s Time to Go.", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome had just seconds to spare before their homes and neighborhoods were consumed by the deadly fires in California.Some of those who survived what is considered the deadliest outbreak of fire that the state has ever seen fled the flames with just seconds to spare. Behind them, in rearview mirrors or over shoulders, they saw their homes, possessions, entire neighborhoods consumed by the inferno.They are left now with memories, intense ones, unforgettable ones, of relaxing quietly on a Sunday night one moment and running for their lives the next. What they cannot forget is the fire, it\u2019s quickness and heat, its smell and destructive nature. These are some of the stories of those who saw the fire and tried to outrace it:\u201cI was watching a movie with my 19-year-old granddaughter and I smelled smoke, and I looked out the window to see flames approaching,\u201d recalled Maureen Grinnell, 77, who lives in the hills north of Napa with her husband, Sheldon, 89. \u201cI went outside to try to wet things down with the hose, but it was clear it was futile, and we just had to get out of there.\u201dAt that point, she said, it was a rush for safety.\u201cFrom when I first realized what was happening until we left, it was no more than seven to 10 minutes,\u201d Ms. Grinnell said, \u201cbut by the time I started to back the car out of the garage, the house was already on fire. We always thought the alert system would give us time, but there was no notice, no warning.\u201d\u201cWe took almost nothing with us. It was me, my husband, who uses a walker, our granddaughter, and her poodle.\u201d\u201cWe started going down the hill, but it looked like we couldn\u2019t go through, so we turned around and went the other way. But we didn\u2019t go far before the road was blocked, and firefighters told us we had to turn back the first way we went, so we did. I wasn\u2019t sure we could get through. I drove down the road through smoke with flames on both sides.\u201dBrad Weinper, 64, a resident of a Santa Rosa subdivision where hundreds of houses burned, said neighbors were wakened by neighbors, barking dogs, police officers and exploding propane tanks.\u201cWe heard constant explosions. The winds were so strong. Trash cans were blowing over,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police came by with a megaphone. They said, \u2018Evacuate now! Evacuate now!\u2019\u201dA car horn woke up Tom Caserta of Santa Rosa.\u201cIt was a neighbor across the way. I think his daughter showed up and was blasting the horn saying, \u2018Hurry up, Dad, hurry up!\u2019\u201d Mr. Caserta said. \u201cThen a deputy came down and started yelling, \u2018leave, leave!\u2019 So we got maybe 10 minutes. We could see it coming over the hill.\u201dThe smell of smoke woke Doug Hugill, also of Santa Rosa.\u201cWe drove over to see what was up. We saw the flames coming over the hills,\u201d Mr. Hugill said.\u201cWe headed back home and we got the push alert just as we got home,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin five minutes we had pretty serious embers flying over our house. We had to leave. The house behind us was already on fire. We had barely enough time to get out.\u201dAt a shelter on the Sonoma County Fairgrounds, Candace Hayes walked with her cane, her service dog, Copper, and a friend.Ms. Hayes, 61, who is blind, was awakened at 3:30 a.m. Monday by \u201csomeone banging on my door\u201d in Santa Rosa. The neighbor told her: \u201cGet out! There\u2019s a fire on the ridge.\u201d She left with neighbors, and returned because they thought it was safe. They were ordered to evacuate a few hours later.Her situation is made more difficult by her unfamiliar surroundings. \u201cIf I have to go to the bathroom,\u201d she said, \u201cI have to wake someone up,\u201d for assistance. But her home survived and she said, \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be here.\u201dAs she walked her dog, she said she was grateful for the friend whose shoulder she placed a hand on. The experience, she said, \u201cis shocking and terrifying.\u201dSara and Jon Shepherd fled their home in Redwood Valley, Calif., early Monday, piling some possessions into two cars, along with their two children and two dogs.Mindi Ramos, Ms. Shepherd\u2019s sister, said a neighbor, Paul Hanssen, found Ms. Shepherd hours later in the driveway.Ms. Shepherd, 40, was badly burned, but lucid enough to ask for water. Her daughter Kressa, 17, who Mr. Hanssen found nearby, was also severely injured. Her son, Kai, a shy 14-year-old who was just beginning to open up and liked baseball, wrestling and playing the saxophone, was dead.  Mr. Hanssen found some water for the women and called 911.  \u201cPaul said it appeared they had just dropped where the fire washed over them,\u201d Ms. Ramos said. Mr. Shepherd, 44, was separated from his wife and children, but family members found him at a hospital with severe burns.On Friday, all three were still hospitalized and unable to speak, Ms. Ramos said. It was unclear whether they knew that Kai was gone.\u201cWe had to run for our lives,\u201d said Pamela Taylor, 66, who lost her trailer and everything in it at a Santa Rosa mobile home park.\u201cA gigantic fireball jumped across the freeway,\u201d she said, from the barn \u201cto the trees around the trailer park. I saw two trailers and five cars engulfed in flames\u201d in a matter of minutes.She and her guest then pounded on the door of a friend\u2019s trailer to wake her.\u201cEveryone who lives there is old and needs help,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cI still don\u2019t know that everyone got out alive.\u201d The smoke was so intense that Kylee Garcia, a 19-year-old artist and student in a Santa Rosa subdivision, and her father, Rally Garcia, placed wet washcloths over their noses and mouths.\u201cMy dad went outside to scope out the scene,\u201d she said. A burning leaf hit him in the face.They gathered clothes and fled the house, leaving behind boats, cars, motorcycles, artwork and a pet snake. She and her father then drove the neighborhood looking to help others.\u201cIt only took an hour for the whole neighborhood to burn,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember looking up at the sky. There was black smoke everywhere. The sky was straight yellow.\u201dDays later, Ms. Garcia sat on a metal chair at a shelter. \u201cI still think I can pick up food at my house, but I don\u2019t have a house,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be starting over from the ground up.\u201dHe said he had asthma and did not want to go outside. So he ignored, he said, an automated call advising him to be prepared to evacuate, brushed off the volunteer \u201cwho was banging on my door,\u201d and \u201cthe widows\u201d who normally brought him casseroles but this time begged him to flee.Finally, a police officer told him to leave, so he did. Now he was outside the shelter waiting for a ride home, even though, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be going back.\u201dAt first, the fire was on the other side of the freeway, so Ms. Bratberg was not overly concerned, even after a friend messaged that she was evacuating. Later, she learned the fire had jumped the freeway, so she and her husband fled with their mature cats, Pumpkin and Tepo, nothing more.Before leaving, they ran to their neighbors to warn them, awakening an elderly couple. As the Bratbergs drove away, \u201cWe saw burning embers falling,\u201d she said.On Facebook, Ms. Bratberg posted a message that read: \u201cI\u2019m homeless. I need everything.\u201d A friend of a friend offered them a place to stay for three weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d she said.Tom Caserta, 69, credited goats and luck for his family\u2019s survival and the fact that their house north of Santa Rosa escaped the flames even as houses around them burned to the ground.His three pet goats had chewed every bit of grass to the ground, and the flames, Mr. Caserta said, stopped where the goats had done their work.\u201cI\u2019m going to give them a special treat,\u201d said Mr. Caserta as he patrolled for smoldering logs and stumps.\u201cI saw that glow up there, and when I got up in the morning I didn\u2019t have to have them tell me what was going on,\u201d said Daniel Del Santi, 92, who refused to evacuate his home near Napa and watched the flames come within half a mile of his house. Did he consider evacuating?

{"Headline": "The Battle-Scarred West Wing Veteran Scripting the N.F.L.\u2019s Anthem Message", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "Joe Lockhart was at the center of the storm during the Clinton impeachment. Now he finds himself comfortably in the thick of a debate over players\u2019 kneeling during the anthem.Supported byIn the late 1990s, when the Clinton White House was under siege amid revelations of the president\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky and efforts by Congress to impeach him, it fell on Joe Lockhart, then the White House spokesman, day after day to defend his boss.But unlike many of his predecessors, he did not just take his marching orders. In countless meetings with the president and his advisers, Lockhart helped shape the message he would convey, and he aggressively pressed it to reporters.\u201cHe was out there, he was on point, he was wearing his cleats,\u201d said Doug Sosnik, an adviser to the president who worked closely with Lockhart at the time. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy, willing to say what needs to be said, and he\u2019s not worried about what people are saying about him.\u201dPeople have a lot to say about him again.Last year, Lockhart took his pugnacious style to another embattled institution, the National Football League, where the lifelong Democratic operative has found himself in the conservative confines of a league staggered by the reaction to players\u2019 demonstrating during the playing of the national anthem at games, as well as cases involving domestic violence, concussions, player misconduct and an array of other issues.It is a curious career moment for a man who cut his teeth on the campaign trail and spent part of his post-White House days working for corporate titans like Oracle and Facebook.But, as Sosnik and others who know him attest, Lockhart is a \u201cwartime general, not a peacetime general\u201d for institutions facing conflict. That\u2019s not to say the troops are always in agreement.But there has been friction. Some owners were upset with a comment by Lockhart a few days after President Trump criticized the league and its players over the kneeling during the anthem. Lockhart told reporters that talking about police brutality is \u201cwhat real locker room talk is.\u201dThe statement was viewed as a flagrant jab at the president, who had dismissed as \u201clocker room banter\u201d comments he made about forcing himself on women, heard in a video leaked during the campaign.In a meeting at N.F.L. headquarters the next day, the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 owner, Jerry Jones, and the Washington Redskins\u2019 owner, Dan Snyder, confronted Lockhart to tell him that his remarks would inflame an already fiery issue.Lockhart confirmed the exchange, which was first reported by ESPN, but said his goal was to react quickly and forcefully, not to craft the perfect rejoinder.In interviews, several owners, team executives and league officials said that Lockhart had helped amplify the league\u2019s message, even if they questioned whether more could have been done to anticipate problems before they turned into crises. The attacks by the president, though, were so unusual that \u201cyou can\u2019t dump this at his feet,\u201d one team executive said of Lockhart.Lockhart said that he understood why the owners were frustrated, but that his job was to keep pushing the league\u2019s view, and pushing back at those who opposed it.\u201cThat\u2019s why they allow me to sit up there and promote it and defend the narrative that football is a great game, brings great values and it\u2019s a great business,\u201d he said.The owners\u2019 criticism, he said, \u201cis just part of the job.\u201dGiven the continuing heated debate inside the league on the issue, there is from time to time speculation on whether Lockhart is long for the job. But if there is a movement to oust him, it is a quiet one.At events like the Super Bowl, Lockhart is often within arm\u2019s reach of the league\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, the pair a study in contrasts. Goodell is tall, athletic and prim. Lockhart is slumped, stocky and tousled. He was so used to the casual dress style in Silicon Valley that he reluctantly resumed wearing neckties when he joined the button-down N.F.L.Unlike his boss, who has worked more than four decades at the league office, Lockhart has thinner links to football. Growing up in Rockland County, northwest of New York City, he rooted for Joe Namath and the Jets, he said, but colleagues remember him more as a baseball fan, with a picture of the 1986 Mets hanging in his West Wing office. In high school, he played basketball, not football.On Sundays during the season, if Lockhart is not at a stadium, he typically watches games in his Manhattan apartment with his two young children, whom he had with his second wife, Giovanna Gray, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York. (His first marriage, to the television journalist Laura Logan, ended in divorce.)His political genes developed early.Dinnertime conversation growing up was more likely to be about politics and journalism than sports. His parents worked in television, and his father was a longtime producer at NBC News. Every four years, the Lockhart family spent the summer wherever the presidential conventions were being held.Some of the tone and messaging of the league\u2019s statements, which Lockhart helped craft, have also been in line with a Democratic progressive, a point some owners, a group that includes several staunch supporters of the president, have not missed. They seemed to seek a \u201cthird way,\u201d a famously Clintonian way of compromise.Goodell\u2019s statement did not explicitly defend the players\u2019 right to protest during the anthem, or even mention racism, the core issue that started the sitting and kneeling demonstrations last season, but it included an unusually strong rebuttal to the president.\u201cDivisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the N.F.L., our great game and all our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities,\u201d it said.Many owners, including several who are donors to Democratic causes, soon followed with similar statements of their own. But other owners issued statements lamenting the league\u2019s getting pulled into political debates.Lockhart has kept his assertive posture. In a talk with reporters, he was asked about the president, who said the N.F.L. should force all players to stand for the anthem. \u201cHe\u2019s exercising his freedom to speak, and I\u2019m exercising my freedom not to react,\u201d Lockhart replied dryly.As the N.F.L. and social media have grown, the league has become a lightning rod for a host of social issues, including bullying and domestic violence, that stretch its capacity to control the narrative.Lockhart began advising the league as a consultant in 2014, after video surfaced showing the former running back Ray Rice knocking out his fianc\u00e9e in an elevator.When Lockhart\u2019s predecessor, Paul Hicks, left the N.F.L. at the end of 2015, he was a logical replacement. Lockhart was interested in returning to New York and, he said, taking on a complex challenge to make the N.F.L. more fleet-footed and assured in responding to controversy. (It is unclear what he is paid, but according to N.F.L. tax filings, Hicks earned $1.5 million in his last year at the league.)Some reporters are not buying what it is being pushed. Jim Trotter, the president of the Pro Football Writers of America, took exception to Lockhart\u2019s assertion that the league had tried to become more transparent. Lockhart\u2019s conference calls were initially not open to all writers, and Goodell and other top executives have not been made available, Trotter said.\u201cThere\u2019s no question they have been more proactive, and that\u2019s part of Joe Lockhart\u2019s approach to it,\u201d Trotter said. \u201cThey will respond to things quicker than in the past. Does that mean it\u2019s accurate? No, but it\u2019s their opinion.\u201dLockhart said his politics had little to do with his job.\u201cMy work is about making sure that people understand what it is we\u2019re doing, why that is and what impact it is having,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s devoid of a political agenda. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have political views. But my overriding view when I come to work is, What\u2019s good for the N.F.L.?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity reporter based in Boulder, Colo., discussed the tech she is using.As a cybersecurity reporter, what do you do to secure your technology setup?I went through a period about three years ago of trying to have perfect \u201cop sec\u201d for everything. I used a password manager. I had a spare computer for web browsing beyond email, banking and social media. I used Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, encryption for any emails with sources. And I refused to buy any \u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices, like a Nest thermostat, fearing that all those devices did was give hackers entry into my home.But over the past year or so, I have to admit, I\u2019ve backtracked. I\u2019ve covered a few too many breaches of password managers and of security companies, and sophisticated nation-state attacks, to believe that there is such thing as \u201cop sec.\u201dSo now my goal is to try to make the lives of cybercriminals and spies harder online, and take my most sensitive communications completely offline \u2014 which in practice means meeting my most coveted sources at a set date, time and place once a quarter.What tech tools or web services do you avoid to prevent sensitive information from being exposed?Also, I stay far from any app that has not been vetted by Google Play or Apple. It\u2019s disturbingly easy for cybercriminals to design apps that mimic a benign, mainstream product, then plant it in third-party app stores. Once downloaded, those apps potentially have access to every critical piece of information you store on your phone, by which I mean everything.Well, actually the worst-case scenario is someone taking control of my self-driving car. It will be a while before I feel safe buying one of those.As for what I did, I signed up for the credit monitoring, froze my credit and then banged my head against my desk a few more times. This is actually the second time my information has been stolen. I used Anthem for insurance, which was nearly as bad. At this point, all I can do is freeze my credit, change my passwords, set stricter security settings on my life and pray.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? For a tech reporter, I\u2019m actually fairly agnostic about tech in general. I\u2019m not one of those people constantly experimenting with the latest, greatest apps and services. I do not understand Snapchat. Do emojis count? I am bullish on emojis.I do use Instacart, though I wish I wasn\u2019t that lazy. And I am one of Spotify\u2019s biggest users. I probably make a new playlist once a week, then I blast it through the house via Sonos. I use Google Docs and Dropbox for work. I try my best to stay off Facebook, but I do use Instagram, mostly to entertain my dog\u2019s followers. He has his own account: \u201cHomerthebestdog,\u201d though we just had to change the name to accommodate our new puppy, so now it\u2019s \u201cHomerandHanzo.\u201d (Sorry, Homes!)What could be better about the tech?I believe in free speech. But I do not believe in free speech for robots.Smartphones have been equipped with fingerprint sensors for years. Now Apple is moving into face recognition for unlocking a phone. Like or dislike, and why?That\u2019s a tough question. I am in favor of anything that replaces passwords. Passwords are useless, annoying and security\u2019s weakest link. So initially I applauded Apple\u2019s move to fingerprint sensors.I think they raise legitimate concerns. But I\u2019m also of the mind-set that the people I worry most about having access to my face template \u2014 namely spies or cybercriminals I\u2019ve angered with my reporting \u2014 will be able to access anything they want about me with enough time and resources, anyway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In California Wine Country, Wildfires Take a Toll on Vintages and Tourism", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFatal wildfires scorching eight Northern California counties this week have dealt a devastating blow to the important wine and tourism industries, destroying several historic wineries and threatening the remaining grape harvest in the Napa and Sonoma valleys.Tourism in the region \u2014 a multibillion-dollar economic machine that includes high-end hotels, wine-tasting tours and upscale cuisine \u2014 is suffering as the flames have claimed a number of establishments and forced many others to shutter for the rest of the week.California is the fourth-largest wine producer in the world, according to the Wine Institute advocacy group, and generates $15.2 billion in taxes annually.Among the damaged wineries:\u25a0 Signorello Estate, a family-owned, ivy-draped winery along the scenic Silverado Trail in Napa, was also engulfed in flames.The French Laundry, a restaurant in Yountville with three Michelin stars, was closed Monday night because of power failures.Some wineries in the fire\u2019s path escaped serious harm.Darioush Winery, in Napa, lost half of its Persian-inspired landscaping to the flames, but the winery was still standing and the wines were in good condition, said Dan de Polo, president of the winery.\u201cIt\u2019s dynamic and messy right now,\u201d he said of the fires. \u201cThere are still a lot of dangerous zones.\u201dAt the James Cole Winery, in Napa, the co-owner James Harder and his family evacuated Sunday night after the fire demolished the eight-foot fence surrounding the vineyard. Neighboring homes were burning to the ground, as was the nearby Signorello winery.\u201cWe thought our property was gone,\u201d Mr. Harder said.But then the winds shifted. He and several friends returned to James Cole and formed a \u201cbucket brigade\u201d to put out remaining flames, saving all but a few small outbuildings.On Tuesday, Mr. Harder returned through \u201cvery dangerous smoke and haze\u201d with a rented truck to rescue grapes that had been waiting in bins and barrels to ferment. The winery still had five acres of unpicked grapes and 10 tons of the fruit in the cellar.\u201cWe tasted some, and they were still pretty good,\u201d Mr. Harder said. \u201cBut we smell like smoke, so we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re really tasting.\u201dThe wine industry in Napa County supports 46,000 jobs locally through the 700 grape growers and 475 wineries operating in the area, the vast majority of them family owned, according to the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.For now, wineries are trying to hook up generators for electricity and will most likely be out of operation for four or five days, said Pete Richmond, who runs Silverado Farming Company, a vineyard management firm.\u201cThe biggest issue is trying to reach out to people to contact them to come back to work, because a lot have evacuated and cell service is miserable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re trying to reach places, but the roads are still closed and we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll have access to them.\u201dWineries that lost vineyards will have to wait three to five years to nurse the soil back to health and coax out a viable crop of grapes, said Karissa Kruse, president of the Sonoma County Winegrowers.Surviving grapes may suffer smoke taint \u2014 a smoky flavor that makes them unusable for fine wine, she said. Wineries damaged or destroyed by the fire could lose vast reserves of wines aging in barrels and bottles. The repercussions of the fire on wine stored in barrels and tanks is unclear.Still, Ms. Kruse pointed to some silver linings. In most cases, the flames destroyed the brush planted between the rows of grapes, and not the resilient vines themselves. And record-breaking temperatures in September meant that fewer grapes were left exposed to the fires.\u201cFor the most part, the vintage is in, and we should still have a viable wine community as we move forward,\u201d Ms. Kruse said. \u201cWe all grumbled that the Labor Day heat was going to define the 2017 vintage, but it expedited the harvest, which we now look at as such a blessing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wines Are No Longer Free to Travel Across State Lines", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThose days are no more. In the last year or so, carriers like United Parcel Service and FedEx have told retailers that they will no longer accept out-of-state shipments of alcoholic beverages unless they are bound for one of 14 states (along with Washington, D.C.) that explicitly permit such interstate commerce.New York is not one of those 14 states, as The New York Times\u2019s wine panel learned to its chagrin in the last year.All of the bottles we sample at our wine tastings are purchased retail. When Bernard Kirsch, our tasting coordinator, could not find the wines he wanted in New York, he ordered from elsewhere, doing regular business with retailers in California and New Jersey, among other places. I, too, like many wine lovers, occasionally bought wine from out-of-state shops for my personal consumption. But that has ended.Strictly speaking, it was probably never entirely legal in New York or in many other states to have wine shipped in from out-of-state retailers. Yet, these laws requiring a license for interstate wine shipments seemed vague and were rarely enforced.But now, states \u2014 urged on by wine and spirits wholesalers who oppose any sort of interstate alcohol commerce that bypasses them \u2014 have stepped up enforcement efforts. Retailers say that the carriers began sending out letters to them a year ago saying they would no longer handle their shipments.Before the internet, the bigger wine shops sometimes printed periodic catalogs for their customers, particularly around the holidays. If those catalogs found their way into hands in other states and enticed a few far-flung sales, it was no big deal one way or the other.Broadband changed everything. No longer did retailers have to identify and attract potential customers. With a few clicks of the mouse, eager consumers could seek out wine shops all over the country, scour their inventories and order the bottles they wanted.Like other retailers I spoke with, Mr. Wolff was not willing to offer precise sales figures, but he said a significant amount of Chambers Street\u2019s business had been from out of state.\u201cIt seems a shame to tell consumers anywhere that they can\u2019t freely purchase something they want,\u201d he said.Though the ruling applied to wineries, not to retailers, Granholm had a liberating effect on consumers who suddenly found it much easier to find the wines they wanted online. The decision also allows the direct shipment of wines purchased by tourists at wineries to all states.\u201cAs in anything in business, this is pure greed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very few industries that are so regulated. We have an authority that looks over us, that makes sure we pay our bills on time. We have a very rigid system in place, state by state. These wholesalers, they hold all the cards.\u201dThe wholesalers, for their part, insist that their interest is solely to protect consumers from fraud, threats to health and underage drinking.\u201cNew York can\u2019t hold Nevada accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cMultiply that out by tens of thousands. There\u2019s no jurisdiction for retailers at the federal level.\u201d\u201cWith everybody licensed, the supply chain is guaranteed top to bottom,\u201d he said.Wholesalers have argued for years that such tight regulation, which happens to be to their commercial advantage, is all that protects the wine and spirits business from descending into chaos. The Supreme Court did not buy the argument in 2005, and to me, their economic interest seems a far more likely motivation than public health.\u201cWe\u2019ve felt the pinch of states closing down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to look for other ways to replace that business.\u201dAt the same time, retailers are lobbying for bills that would loosen restrictions on web purchases. A bill in New York that would permit out-of-state retailers to ship to New York died in committee last year, Mr. Posner said. He is hoping the bill will be reintroduced in January.\u201cThe internet has allowed many industries to go forward, but this is sending us backward,\u201d he said.Independent retailers also face the threat of consolidation. Costco is now the biggest wine retailer in the country, and Amazon is now getting into selling wine, a move that has been given brick-and-mortar significance by its recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which has many outlets with retail wine licenses.This does not affect New York retailers so much as New York law restricts retailers to one license, and therefore one store, in the state. But around the country it means fewer choices for consumers. Curtailing out-of-state shipping only makes it worse.In an age where you can order just about anything on the internet, including wine, consumers deserve safe access to great retailers over state borders.AlaskaCaliforniaIdahoLouisianaMissouriNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew MexicoNorth DakotaOregonVirginiaWashington, D.C.West VirginiaWyomingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Simple Ways to Be Better at Remembering", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the sum total of human knowledge rests an arm\u2019s length away in each person\u2019s pocket, why do we have to remember anything anymore?Mr. LeDoux, whose work focuses on how the brain forms memories, said this instant-fact setup clouds our judgment on what information to filter and store. Since we\u2019re no longer weighed down by having to retain trivial data, we are left with greater cognitive space. But how do we select what we remember?Memory is a fallible thing, changing over time. Recalling a long-term memory brings it back into our short-term memory, which essentially gives it new context. Memory is therefore a reconstruction, not a photographic recording, and for economic purposes, our brains \u2014 unlike computers \u2014 are forever rerecording those memories, making them far more error prone.On top of that, we now live inside dual screens and endless browser tabs, headphones streaming music, smartphones buzzing, co-workers chatting with us on Slack \u2014 all while we should be performing the actual jobs we\u2019re paid to be doing.Mr. LeDoux added: \u201cThe brain does have limitations to what it can process or handle.\u201dThey\u2019re both right, but there are still things we can do to improve our memories.As simple as it sounds, the repetition of tasks \u2014 reading, or saying words over and over \u2014 continues to be the best method for transforming short-term memories into long-term ones. To do that, we have to retrain our minds to focus on one task at a time. Sadly, most bypass this formula because we\u2019re already convinced we\u2019re productive.New connections are made in your brain when you learn. To remember what you learn, do what you probably did in your youth: Repeat words, thoughts and ideas over and over until you get them right. It\u2019s the easiest brain game there is.Forget cramming. It didn\u2019t work in college, it doesn\u2019t work now. Spaced repetition might be the best way.But once you stop rehearsing that knowledge, the retention drops profoundly. Researchers call this the \u201cforgetting curve.\u201dTo get past it, space out your repetition over a few days and test the effect yourself. But be careful: Spacing out sessions or scheduling them too concurrently seem to slow gains, so find a healthy medium that works. This is a good way to effectively start tackling a new language.Memory and focus go hand-in-hand. Dr. Cowan suggests rearranging our office setup as one way to improve focus. He believes the collaborative start-up design and open offices touted by Silicon Valley\u2019s hoodied C.E.O.s actually make us far less productive because they create added distractions. How do you stay on task if your co-worker is piloting a drone or endlessly, and loudly, snacking just inches away?\u201cThe rebirth of the open workplace cannot be helping this situation,\u201d Dr. Cowan said, alluding to work spaces without desks, physical barriers and privacy, but with a plethora of playthings. Yoga rooms, rock climbing and gardens can be great perks, but they can make it difficult to deliver on deadline with so much stimuli.\u201cMemory is very cue dependent,\u201d he said, referring to something he calls absent-minded memory failure. \u201cMost say it could never happen to me, but it\u2019s a very long list of responsible people that it has happened to. When you don\u2019t have that cue, you can forget almost anything.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe really tricky thing about absent-minded memory failure is it can affect almost anything if the cue is not present at the moment you need to catch a reaction.\u201dA simple way around that is to set reminders. Even better, combine a few of these techniques: Write your reminder on a Post-it and put it on your desk so you\u2019re forced to repeatedly look at it over a prolonged period, incorporating the practice of spaced repetition. Build on your memory by combining these approaches. Modern life offers few guarantees, but using even one of these tips is surely an improvement.\u201cA lot of people are overconfident that they can handle distractions,\u201d Mr. Schacter said. \u201cDoing two things at once always has an effect. Be aware of the situation you\u2019re in and understand when you let attention divide you, you\u2019re likely to pay the price. In some situations it may not matter, but in others it could change everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some diplomats say they are trying to preserve whatever influence they may have left, in order to avert an even worse catastrophe.More than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, when a Rohingya militant attack on Myanmar security posts catalyzed a brutal counteroffensive.

Those who cannot flee are trapped and hungry in northern Rakhine, according to anecdotal evidence collected by international aid agencies, which the government has largely prevented from delivering relief supplies or even assessing need in the region.\u201cThere are few places on Earth where we are denied access to this extent,\u201d said Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cWe have an office in northern Rakhine, we have staff there, we have supplies there, we could go tomorrow with our trucks \u2014 but we are being stopped. This is illegal, this is intolerable.\u201dI spoke to half a dozen ambassadors and senior aid agency staff members in Yangon about what the problem was. All asked to speak off the record.There are many reasons for their reticence, but a major one is this: Myanmar has been presented as a success story, despite a host of economic and ethnic problems.But whatever authority she has, as the nation\u2019s state counselor, is dwarfed by that of a military that ruled for nearly half a century and continues to monopolize power.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is not the one ordering Rohingya villages to be burned down or civilians to be massacred. That firepower lies with the Tatmadaw, Myanmar\u2019s military, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.In a Facebook post on Thursday recounting his meeting with the United States ambassador, Scot Marciel, the military chief called reports of a large exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d He reiterated that Rohingya were \u201cnot the natives\u201d of Myanmar.Diplomats say Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi used to express sympathy for the Rohingya in private, explaining that she could not speak out because of widespread hatred for them among the Buddhist majority. But over the past year or so, she has begun implying that the Rohingya are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.In a televised address on Thursday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi pushed back against international criticism and promised to personally oversee efforts to bring peace to Rakhine and repatriate those who have fled to Bangladesh.In the speech, as in an address delivered to foreign envoys last month, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi declined to tackle accusations that the military has unleashed arson, murder and rape on the Rohingya.Despite Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s obfuscations, diplomats in Yangon have tended to avoid increasing public pressure. Veteran observers of Myanmar\u2019s military, which has long faced condemnation for its brutality toward civilians and ethnic minorities, have warned that an international shaming of a disgraced Nobel laureate is just what the generals want.\u201cShe gets all the criticism, and then the Tatmadaw gets to quietly do what it wants and what it has done for decades, which is to burn villages and terrorize ethnic areas,\u201d said David Scott Mathieson, a longtime human-rights researcher in Myanmar.Foreign envoys here are mindful of the complex politics. A nation does not emerge from 50 years of military dictatorship without political wounds, they say, asserting that pushing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose famous resolve can tend toward obduracy, could be counterproductive.One senior Western envoy said that with no real coordination between military and civilian officials, weeks of flying back and forth to talk with them had come to nothing. The diplomat called it \u201cby far the most frustrating issue I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201dMr. Egeland, who once served as the United Nations\u2019 under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, has grown impatient.\u201cI would like to issue a terse message to the diplomats,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to disagree that it is a complicated situation. It is very simple: When humanitarians are not allowed to help civilians, people die.\u201dFor its part, the United Nations in Myanmar commissioned an internal report, submitted in April, that warned against soft-pedaling on human rights to placate the military or the civilian authority.\u201cTrade-offs between advocacy and access,\u201d the report said, \u201chave in practice deprioritized human rights and humanitarian action, which are seen as complicating and undermining relations with government.\u201dThe report\u2019s author, Richard Horsey, noted how quickly the honeymoon period after the 2015 elections had subsided.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the landing spot for Myanmar\u2019s transition may be as one more Southeast Asian nation with authoritarian tendencies, rising nationalism and ethnic tensions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Myanmar should aspire to be so much better than that.\u201dCertainly, few countries enjoyed as much international good will as Myanmar did, at a time when the world was desperate for a positive narrative.\u201cWestern donors and the U.N. have not always been helpful,\u201d said Charles Petrie, a former United Nations resident coordinator in Myanmar, noting \u201cthe refusal for a long time to let go of the fairy-tale view of Myanmar with Aung San Suu Kyi coming to power and the corresponding refusal to push back on some of her dogmatic positions.\u201dMr. Petrie drew comparisons with South Sudan, where the world was \u201cso taken by the narrative of a new country emerging from northern enslavement that the signs of the emerging violence were ignored.\u201dInternational aid workers with years of experience in Rakhine say they have never seen the situation so grave.Brad Hazlett of Partners Relief and Development, a Christian charity that has provided food aid to the Rohingya, said he had been prevented from visiting internment camps this month in the state capital, Sittwe, that he had visited dozens of times before.\u201cI think their strategy is to starve them out,\u201d he said.Abul Hashim, a Rohingya from the northern Rakhine village of Anauk Pyin, described by cellphone how a team of ambassadors and United Nations officials had gone to the community on Oct. 2 as part of a stage-managed government trip. The crowds of officials who had helicoptered in promised food aid to the village.But for nearly 10 days, Mr. Hashim said, his community had received nothing. For three months, none of the Rohingya have been allowed to step outside the village, he said. They have had no access to doctors or schools. Until some aid arrived on Wednesday evening, all he, his wife, their three daughters and three sons had eaten that day was less than a pound of rice and some water.\u201cOur sorrows,\u201d he said, \u201cknow no bounds.\u201dAKM Moinuddin contributed reporting from Dhaka, Bangladesh.Advertisement"}

Last month I moderated panel discussions with government officials and corporate executives about fake news and global creative leadership at the International Chamber of Commerce conference in Sydney.Next week, Joseph Kahn, the managing editor of The Times, will be in Sydney for a series of events.The goal with these appearances is twofold: First, we are looking to introduce The New York Times and what we do to new audiences in Australia that may not realize we are here or can play a relevant role in their lives; second, we are looking to deepen our relationship with readers like you, those who we hope to engage in a conversation so we can learn a bit more about each other and our world.Now here are my stories of the week, plus an especially personal recommendation.______Coming soon, hopefully this weekend: my in-depth look at Amazon\u2019s arrival in Australia and its potential impact on this country\u2019s book industry and culture.

{"Headline": "Canadian Held Hostage in Afghanistan Says Militants Killed His Child", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Joshua Boyle called himself a \u201cpilgrim\u201d who was \u201cengaged in helping\u201d in Afghanistan. A man who crossed into Afghanistan with him described him as an adventurer.Emerging from a room at the Toronto airport \u2014 where the children, all born in captivity, met their Canadian grandparents for the first time \u2014 Mr. Boyle denounced his captors in brief remarks to reporters and gave more details of their horrific ordeal, including the rape of his wife and that the couple had a fourth child, who was killed by their captors.\u201cThe stupidity and evil of the Haqqani network\u2019s kidnapping of a pilgrim and his heavily pregnant wife engaged in helping ordinary villagers in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan was eclipsed only by the stupidity and evil of authorizing the murder of my infant daughter,\u201d he said at the airport.But he offered little insight into what compelled himself and his wife, who was pregnant at the time they were captured, on their journey in the first place.Those who knew him before also have little understanding of how he ended up as a hostage in Afghanistan.While Mr. Boyle was a frequent editor of Wikipedia articles and an avid participant in online gaming forums \u2014 who adopted the names of obscure Star Wars characters as his handle \u2014 he was otherwise virtually invisible on social media. The son of a federal tax judge and devout Christian, he was once married to an outspoken defender of the Sept. 11 attacks.\u201dWe started talking about Lawrence of Arabia and the explorer Richard Burton,\u201d Mr. Cronin wrote. \u201cHe asked me if I admired these explorers.\u201d He said that Mr. Boyle minimized the risk arguing that \u201cthe window is closing and the security situation will only deteriorate when the American troops leave.\u201dOne player, Alex Edwards, 32, from Carleton Place, Ontario, said the two had been friends since 2002, when they met in the online game and at one point in time talked three or four times a week.They soon realized they lived close to one another and eventually met in person.Mr. Edwards, writing in a series of online messages, described Mr. Boyle as an \u201cextremely private person.\u201d He added, \u201cJosh stayed off social media.\u201dAccording to his online friends, he and his wife met during their teenage years in an online Star Wars forum but did not start a romantic relationship until later on.Other friends who knew Mr. Boyle through the online gaming world said he always had an interest in Afghan history and the role the Taliban played in the country.While studying at the nearby University of Waterloo, where he graduated in 2005, Mr. Boyle became immersed in writing and editing Wikipedia entries about Islam and terrorism.The case of Omar Khadr, the only Canadian held by the United States military in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, eventually became a cause for Mr. Boyle.About 2008, he offered his services as a spokesman to Mr. Khadr\u2019s family. Within the year, he became the third husband of Mr. Khadr\u2019s sister, Zaynab.Mr. Boyle, under the user name \u201cSherurcij\u201d (which also sometimes included the first name \u201cJosh\u201d) spent a lot of time editing and updating the Wikipedia page of his former brother-in-law.His other contributions were largely focused on members of the Khadr family, Canadian politics and some posts on Nazi history, among others. He also made contributions to pages about other terrorism incidents around the world and the profiles of those involved.His page also included a note at the bottom, in Arabic, that said \u201cPeace is the solution.\u201d And it included a passage of the Robert W. Service poem \u201cThe Men That Don\u2019t Fit In.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a race of men that don\u2019t fit in,\u201d the poem reads. \u201cA race that can\u2019t stay still; So they break the hearts of kith and kin, And they roam the world at will.\u201dMr. Boyle\u2019s marriage to Ms. Khadr lasted just a year. He then took a job at a hotel reservation call center in Perth-Andover, New Brunswick, a tiny village where he bought a house.One of his former co-workers at the call center said in an interview that two things defined Mr. Boyle: his strong convictions and his desire to bring change to troubled parts of the world.\u201cI think he really did believe that he could personally make a difference by getting in with the common people,\u201d said Terry Ritchie, who is now retired.But Mr. Ritchie, who during Mr. Boyle\u2019s time in captivity pressured Canadian politicians on his behalf, recalled him as excessively idealistic, someone he crossed the street to avoid.\u201cHe was absolutely smug about his convictions,\u201d Mr. Ritchie said.Mr. Ritchie said his co-worker kept a prayer rug at the call center and had permission to use a room for prayers, suggesting that Mr. Boyle had become a Muslim.Ms. Coleman arrived in Perth-Andover soon after the couple were married on a hiking trip in Central America. Not long afterward they went on the trip that led to their capture and confinement.In a video released by the military in Pakistan after Mr. Boyle\u2019s release, Mr. Boyle, sitting beside an exhausted looking Ms. Coleman and their children, repeatedly insisted that their captors were not Muslims.\u201cThe men who kidnapped us did not even make a pretense of being Muslim,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were undoubtedly criminals. They were undoubtedly pagans. They were directed by commanders who were not guided by Islam and who were not even pretending they were guided by Islam.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe criminals who held us they were not good Muslims. They were not even bad Muslims. They were pagan.\u201dWhile Mr. Boyle called for justice against his captors late on Friday, he also acknowledged the task now awaiting him.\u201cIt will be of incredible importance to my family that we are able to build a secure sanctuary for our three surviving children to call a home, to focus on edification and to try to regain some portion of the childhood that they have lost,\u201d he said at the airport.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Volatile Climate on Campus, Professors Teach on Tenterhooks", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cTwelve Steps to a Compassionate Life,\u201d a guide to spreading kindness, is an odd choice for a political science syllabus. But Shannon Mariotti sees the need. Her seminar about race and class alienation invites contention; course readings swing between Tea Party and far-left perspectives.The 13 students represent the stew of political views at Southwestern University, a liberal arts campus in mostly red Georgetown, Tex. Dr. Mariotti pushes buttons, but prudently. She wants reactions, she said, somewhere \u201cbetween nice and angry.\u201d She hopes the book \u2014 from step one (\u201cLearn about compassion\u201d) to 12 (\u201cLove your enemies\u201d) \u2014 will teach students \u201cto develop compassion and empathy\u201d for opposing, even distasteful stances.It is not her only Zen move: As students settle at a long conference table, Dr. Mariotti taps the timer on her iPhone. Classes start with silent meditation. \u201cAll you are supposed to be doing right now is to breathe in and breathe out. Every time you think of something,\u201d she said, \u201cjust let it go.\u201dDr. Mariotti designed this upper-level course in response to political divisions at Southwestern, divisions that have fractured friendships. \u201cThe only way that kind of polarization in politics will get better is if we can find a way to talk to each other in a way that is sympathetic, but not wishy-washy.\u201dThese are fitful times on college campuses. Tumultuous current events \u2014 the revocation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA; the Charlottesville attacks; the Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 have brought both relevance and volatility to academic debate. Inside classrooms, professors feel newly exposed. They want strategies to manage testy exchanges and challenges they don\u2019t see coming.At Reed College this semester, instructors abandoned the stage during the first meeting of Humanities 110, a required freshman course on early Greek and Mediterranean civilization. \u201cWe cannot have our class if we have students interrupting the teaching,\u201d Prof. Elizabeth Drumm announced as a student grabbed a microphone and talked over her. Others joined onstage. One protester held a sign: \u201cDon\u2019t teach us white supremacy.\u201dAt George Mason University, \u201ca fervent Trump supporter\u201d last summer in Jeremy D. Mayer\u2019s course on the presidency sparred at the start of each class. One session, he dismissed an article Dr. Mayer had cited as fake news, with: \u201cThe Washington Post hates Trump!\u201d It was \u201cvery frustrating,\u201d Dr. Mayer said. \u201cHow can you have a class that touches on current events when you don\u2019t have an accepted, fairly standard source of information?\u201dEven content in fact-heavy courses like biology looks less neutral with hot-button issues like reproduction and genetic testing. It\u2019s why Scott McLean, kinesiology professor at Southwestern, is careful when teaching a unit on health insurance. \u201cI really try to present two different sides,\u201d he said. The class movie night showing \u201cMcFarland, USA,\u201d about children of migrant workers who excel at cross country, no longer looks like \u201ca free dinner and getaway from the books.\u201d And so a professor who specializes in the mechanics of body movement must now prep for queries about immigration and DACA.Today\u2019s students bring a multiplicity of personal identities to campus \u2014 their sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, religion, political leanings \u2014 and they want to see that reflected in course content. The values in readings, lectures and even conversations are open to questioning. All good \u2014 that\u2019s what college is supposed to be about \u2014 except that now the safety screen around the examination of ideas has been pulled away. Higher education is increasingly partisan, and professors must manage these disconnected ideologies, which are sometimes between themselves and their students.It\u2019s a charged climate and professors know it. The culture wars playing out in the classroom have made them fearful of being targeted. That has been a particular issue at Northern Arizona University, a politically mixed campus in a red state. Six professors there have received death threats or harassing emails or calls, some after being the subject of posts on conservative media sites, amplified by Facebook and Twitter.\u201cThe air is different now because what you do in a classroom can end up on Fox News,\u201d said Luis Fernandez. His fall course at Northern Arizona, \u201cPolitical Crime,\u201d considers Russia\u2019s use of media tools to meddle in U.S. affairs. This semester, he received threats on his office phone, naming his wife and siblings and citing addresses. The day after, Dr. Fernandez found himself scanning the classroom \u2014 messages had alluded to a student in class \u2014 trying to guess which of the 36 was responsible. \u201cThen I started thinking, \u2018This is really silly. My job is not to identify this person; my job is to educate and teach.\u2019 \u201d The police are investigating.An English professor at Northern Arizona, Anne Scott, did end up on Fox News. After she deducted one point from a first-year student\u2019s paper last spring for using \u201cmankind\u201d instead of \u201chumankind\u201d \u2014 she said she had told the class that \u201cinclusive\u201d vocabulary is required \u2014 the student contacted the website Campus Reform. She received more than 400 emails, rude voice mail messages and dropped calls. This semester, when the student\u2019s name appeared on the wait-list for a course she was teaching, Dr. Scott said, \u201cI was terrified.\u201dThese clashes are affecting curriculum. After meeting with a professor to plan a spring course on fascism and anti-fascism, \u201cwe decided it was probably not worth it,\u201d said Lori Poloni-Staudinger, head of the department of politics and international affairs, who has also received threats. The class won\u2019t be offered. \u201cPeople are more guarded,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are watching what they say.\u201dAs campuses grow more racially and economically diverse, navigating strong emotions has become a coveted skill. Anita Davis is in a newly created post of director of diversity and inclusion at the Associated Colleges of the South, a consortium of 16 institutions that helps professors with \u201chot\u201d conversations. \u201cThey are struggling to handle tense, confrontational, challenging moments,\u201d she said.Tools she shares are new to professors focused on conveying content. On the first day, she urges instructors to work with students to create ground rules for class discussions, including what to do when talk gets heated. She shares tricks like asking students, before peers pounce, to rephrase or repeat a provocative utterance (often it\u2019s less harsh). If someone suggests that people who ride busses are poor, instead of calling him \u201cclassist,\u201d she said, a teacher could reframe: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the labels that come up when we talk about social class.\u201dIt\u2019s also important to openly discuss cultural identity with students, rather than make assumptions. \u201cYou can be from the same background and be very different,\u201d she said. \u201cOr you can be from very different backgrounds and think very similarly.\u201d Digging below the surface is critical because students \u201care asking for more opportunity to be complicated individuals.\u201dProfessors who once skipped pre-semester faculty workshops now want to know \u201chow to model productive disagreement,\u201d said Theresa Braunschneider, associate director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Research on Learning and Teaching. \u201cWe are responding to increased demand across the university for programming that helps instructors.\u201d A recent workshop had a wait-list of 50; 10 colleges, including an engineering school, have requested custom sessions.The center also has a theater program in which actors perform classroom scenarios; a facilitator debriefs faculty audiences. Popular sketches hit touchy subjects \u2014 a Muslim student accidentally leaves behind a backpack; a student jokes that it contains a bomb. What should the professor do?In \u201cConflict in the Classroom,\u201d a sketch recently staged at Skidmore College, a statistics \u201cclass\u201d discusses correlation and causation. The \u201cprofessor\u201d posits an example: the link between infant mortality and maternal income. The \u201cstudents\u201d raise questions that have nothing to do with math. \u201cIt becomes a debate about the variables,\u201d said Sara Armstrong, the artistic director: One student wonders why the example doesn\u2019t consider household income, and defines a household as man and woman. Another objects. The first accuses the other of attacking. The instructor interjects, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is appropriate for this class. We really can\u2019t talk about this.\u201d The upset student insists, \u201cThis is a problem! We have to talk about this!\u201d A student records on his phone.In the post-performance discussion, the faculty members backtrack: What could the instructor have done ahead of time to prevent problems? What could the instructor do in the moment? And afterward? Approaches involve addressing not just what is taught, but how and why. The professor might explain why he chose the case study, pause the discussion, or email the class, acknowledging the disruption and, perhaps, apologizing.Getting faculty prepared is why Kristie A. Ford, director of the Center for Leadership, Teaching and Learning at Skidmore, invited the Michigan troupe as part of a semester series she calls \u201cTeaching in a Time of Turmoil.\u201d \u201cRegardless of discipline, we cannot shut out the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is seeping into our classrooms, and we need to hone our skills for how to productively engage with it.\u201d\u2022Classmates in Dr. Mariotti\u2019s seminar gathered in a library lecture room overlooking a sunny quad to share with a reporter what bothers them. At the top of the list: professors who expose their views on current affairs.Conner Joyce, a \u201cmoderate Republican\u201d majoring in political science, scratched a double major in philosophy because a professor kept comparing Trump to Hitler. Instead of engaging, he said, \u201cyou shrink back: I will just write my paper, take my test and move on.\u201dSydney Cardenas, a Trump voter, objects to liberal students\u2019 special alliances with liberal professors. \u201cThey make those jokes,\u201d she said, and instructors slyly signal approval \u201cunder the table\u201d or with a giggle. You expect politics in political science, she said, but she was irritated that her education class \u201cwas extremely political for no reason whatsoever.\u201dCamille Martin and Mikaela Manion, left-identifying students who have strong religious backgrounds, face prickly moments, too. \u201cPeople can be hostile when Christianity and the whole evangelical movement are brought up in class,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cIt triggers me.\u201dMs. Manion felt her anger rise in class when a student dismissed religion as \u201cthe opiate of the masses.\u201d \u201cIt was very derogatory toward Christianity and that was very hard to deal with,\u201d she said. Later, she wrote \u201cliberation theology,\u201d a term that marries religion and social justice, in large pink uppercase letters in her notebook.In the seminar, silent meditation over, Dr. Mariotti dove into the assignment, which was to speak with someone holding an opposing political view. She would use their reactions to help draft ground rules for class discussion. For example, notice your own bias so you can grapple more generously with others.Rachel Arco said she is \u201ca competitive person.\u201d The exercise and the Armstrong reading told her that every conversation \u201cdoes not need to have a goal or something you can win.\u201d It\u2019s an opening. To which Oscar Barbour offered a useful idea: People should \u201clet go of their personal stake\u201d in a charged conversation.A kind thought, but Ms. Manion wasn\u2019t buying: \u201cI want to challenge Oscar. We are part of the conversation. We can\u2019t distance ourselves from what we care about.\u201dMr. Joyce jumped in to defend Mr. Barbour: \u201cIt can be honoring your own values to open them up to challenge.\u201d But then you risk being \u201cnice\u201d rather than \u201cauthentic.\u201dAssuming the best of classmates, Ms. Arco confessed, \u201cis something I\u2019m not very good at.\u201dIn what may prove to be the hidden gift of these provocative times, grappling with dicey subjects may force students to reflect, and not just to react. \u201cThey are struggling with how the book makes them feel,\u201d Dr. Mariotti said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about where the limits of our empathy are.\u201dLaura Pappano is writer in residence at the Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Fanned Flames With Twitter, Which Faces a Blowback", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Fires need fuel. In this era of political rage, a Twitter account that called itself the unofficial voice of Tennessee Republicans provided buckets of gasoline.Its pre-election tweets were a bottomless well of inflammatory misinformation: \u201cObama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.\u201d A mysterious explosion in Washington, it said, had killed one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides, raising her \u201cbody count\u201d to six. Another proclaimed, \u201cObama is the founder of ISIS.\u201dThe account, @TEN_GOP, eventually reached more than 130,000 followers \u2014 10 times that of the official state Republican Party\u2019s Twitter handle. It was one of the most popular political voices in Tennessee. But its lies, distortions and endorsements came from the other side of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and disheartening to see how an outside actor can pinpoint areas of division in America and then exploit them,\u201d said Brent Leatherwood, the former executive director of the Tennessee Republican Party. \u201cYou think we\u2019re getting to a better place and then something like this throws a Molotov cocktail into it.\u201dPerhaps no form of communication has ever established itself so quickly and so thoroughly as social media. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information. Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning. They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia.How much damage did those accounts do in the months leading up to the presidential election? No one knows, not even the companies themselves, which are slowly and grudgingly releasing data about what happened. Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy. But for Twitter \u2014 influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful \u2014 the situation is more vexing. Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.Many of Twitter\u2019s users have long been frustrated with the site\u2019s scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment. Twitter\u2019s critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump. Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the president\u2019s Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say we\u2019re all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people,\u201d he said.There are already signs that Twitter\u2019s bottom line is feeling the effects. An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019. Since other parts of social media \u2014 most notably Facebook \u2014 are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.\u201cHate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users,\u201d said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities. \u201cIf you think about why are people alcoholics, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t acknowledge they\u2019re alcoholics.\u201dHe added about Twitter, \u201cIt has never managed to come to grips with harassment.\u201dTwitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year. But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected. Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week. When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad. Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it \u201cinadequate at every level.\u201d He added that Twitter had \u201cfailed to understand how serious this issue is.\u201dOn Tuesday, Twitter said it would \u201cdramatically\u201d increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like. Political ads will be specially marked. Mr. Warner called Twitter\u2019s plan \u201ca good first step.\u201dBut the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc. The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state. It billed itself as the \u201cUnofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans\u201d but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.\u201cWe thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird,\u201d said Mr. Leatherwood. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you abbreviate Tennessee. Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.\u201dThe real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed. \u201cIt was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments,\u201d Mr. Leatherwood said. \u201cIt offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.\u201dSince the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation. He said others had as well. He never heard back.After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trump\u2019s firing of F.B.I. director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, \u201cI love my whiteness. And yours.\u201d@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account,\u201d said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself. \u201cBut it never occurred to me it was the Russians.\u201dTwitter is, as ever, a work in progress. After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, \u201cWe need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fake News Floods the Philippines", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs it has around the world, the internet in the Philippines has become a morass of fake news and conspiracy theories, harassment and bullying. This has muddied public discourse and cultivated a populist attitude toward democracy. What is true, or legal, is no longer important as long as the majority supports it. Responsibility has been discarded for partisanship.The fake news isn\u2019t always complimentary. An opposition politician was said to be \u201crecruiting soldiers for a coup.\u201d Vice President Leni Robredo, of the opposition Liberal Party, had supposedly met with Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general at the time, to conspire to remove the president.I know well what it\u2019s like to be targeted by this propaganda machine. My opposition to the president\u2019s violent rhetoric and his disdain for democratic checks and balances has earned me attacks and threats. Usually Duterte Diehard Supporters will seize on one of my columns or Facebook posts, engaging in ad hominem assaults on their pages that they tacitly encourage their followers to continue onto mine. It has come to the point that I check every morning to see if something I wrote has prompted more abuse. (You can imagine what this essay will elicit.)I am far from the only Filipino to get this treatment. The attacks come in waves from outraged trolls \u2014 with social media accounts and inboxes flooded with insults, promises of violence and memes made to expressly mock and disgrace \u2014 before they move on to the next target after several days. The duration and intensity seem directly correlated to the reach and influence of the person being attacked. Recently, an anonymous anti-Duterte blogger and the man who merely administers the server hosting her popular blog were publicly outed and threatened, and now face libel charges \u2014 a criminal offense that carries possible imprisonment.Just as the real-world killings include innocents, the online assassinations have proven similarly indiscriminate. A Filipina propagandist living in the Netherlands recently sought to discredit a journalist who, it turned out, only had the same name as someone who had worked for the opposition.In The Manila Times, Mr. Makabenta issued neither correction nor retraction of his article on Ms. Haley, despite public criticism as well as a statement from the American Embassy. Instead he doubled down in a subsequent column, citing President Trump\u2019s rhetoric on a hands-off foreign policy.\u201cSome will continue to badger me for allegedly falling victim to fake news,\u201d Mr. Makabenta wrote, as if his lack of responsibility was ultimately inconsequential. He continued: \u201cThe idea will live on long after the hysterics are over.\u201dMr. Makabenta\u2019s fake news article remains on The Manila Times website, just as if it were true. That speaks volumes about accountability in the era of Mr. Duterte. Given this administration, and those who prop it up, this is typical and expected. And that, sadly, is a fact.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mike Isabella, Washington\u2019s Restless Restaurateur", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mike Isabella fanned himself with a hard hat as he stood on a construction site on the bank of the Potomac that workers were frantically trying to turn into a contemporary French restaurant. Permits and a liquor license had yet to materialize. The basement was nowhere near ready to receive shipments. The floors were \u2014 well, there were no floors.\u201cWhen do you think I can come in here and cook, honestly?\u201d he asked a group of construction crew leaders. Soon, one of them said. Probably. Soon-ish.Any disquiet on Mr. Isabella\u2019s part was telegraphed by a mild bulging of the eyes and a twitch of his multifarious tattoos. Extensive fretting may be a luxury for single-restaurant chefs; Mr. Isabella, mindful of his ever-growing dining dominion, had to race to a sushi tasting across the river in Virginia.Requin, a modernist food church at the center of a fabricated village, is a metaphor of sorts for Mr. Isabella\u2019s unique stature among Washington restaurateurs \u2014 a perch attained, in large part, through simple proliferation.Mr. Isabella owes his culinary fecundity to smart location plays, and a large and loyal team of chefs, bartenders, construction managers and two Greek-American brothers who have been the spine of his most-replicated outpost, Kapnos Taverna. He commands a United Nations of cuisines: the down-home Italian food of his youth, Greek and Mediterranean cooking, coastal Mexican fare and even some ramen.In many ways, Mr. Isabella is the very model of the modern major chef: His $30 million empire has put his food into airports, a baseball stadium, events with catering, lunchboxes delivered to office workers and his own take on a food hall, while he moves along, sharklike, with various versions of his sit-down restaurants.This has taken him, as it has many other chefs, out of the kitchen. His knife set now comes out only at home.Mr. Isabella also had the Spidey sense to settle into Washington, where breakneck growth and the attendant investor cash have all exploded in recent years. His work force of 600 employees will nearly double once his new places open.\u201cHe isn\u2019t front and center,\u201d as if he were just a chef with a single restaurant, she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the Mike show. There isn\u2019t the illusion of that.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s not always the most cutting-edge food, but it\u2019s food that pushes the boundaries just enough while remaining comfortable for people.\u201dMr. Isabella, 42, seems to spend each day checking on an existing restaurant, peeking at a behind-schedule construction site, meeting with a catering client. He zooms back and forth in his black Range Rover, dragging on a cigarette between stops and musing aloud about something that has to be done that isn\u2019t being done but might be done, or not.\u201cI have so much in my head,\u201d he said on a recent afternoon, lamenting the absence of his assistant, who sends emails simultaneously transcribing whatever pops out.He grew up in New Jersey and studied at the now-closed Restaurant School of New York, and spent the early part of his career along the Acela corridor, working in fine dining in New York before heading to Philadelphia, where he cooked for, among others, the chef Marcus Samuelsson and the prolific restaurateur Stephen Starr.Mr. Isabella turned on his signature confidence, pressing the \u201cTop Chef\u201d judge to let him in. \u201cI could already tell he had an outsized personality and was very ambitious,\u201d Mr. Colicchio said.When Mr. Isabella returned to Washington after the show, he continued for a while at Zaytinya, but in 2011 struck out on his own with Graffiato, an Italian start-up in Chinatown inspired by his grandmother\u2019s cooking. \u201cMike has used the opportunity to make a good name for himself,\u201d Mr. Andr\u00e9s said. \u201cSince I met Mike, he always wanted more.\u201dMr. Isabella\u2019s pace invites the pitfalls that have tripped up many before him: overextending oneself, losing control over quality.So far, careful hiring and training have been his secret sauce, Mr. Isabella said. George and Nick Pagonis, the culinary and managerial backbones of the five various Kapnos restaurants, have been with Mr. Isabella since the beginning. Taha Ismail, his beverage director, has worked with him since their Zaytinya days.\u201cIf you grow too big too fast you have to hire, hire, hire, and if you build too fast you dilute your brand,\u201d Ms. Meek-Bradley said. \u201cIt becomes, \u2018Oh, they are never in the kitchen, they have too much going on,\u2019 when you don\u2019t have the right people in place. Mike understands the need to bring in some strong teams. He is a good person to work for and rewards hard work.\u201dChefs here back one another up, when needed, with spare pots and pans; they cook together on the extensive charity circuit, and are happy to share excess tomatoes, the names of suppliers and advice.\u201cWhen I worked at Per Se in New York, no one was friends with the people at Jean-Georges, which was across the street,\u201d Ms. Meek-Bradley said. \u201cThe thing I love about D.C. is there is this sense of camaraderie here and sense of pride.\u201dMr. Isabella remains very much a part of that world, dining often with chef friends at home. Still, the scale of his enterprises sets him apart.Although he long ago shed his bad-boy image, his name can sometimes prompt undefined unease among food professionals here, as if his high profile were a personal threat to the city\u2019s nascent culinary status.\u201cOf course, people are going to be a little resentful or jealous,\u201d Ms. Meek-Bradley said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what happens when you are willing to take those calculated risks that a lot of us are not willing to do, or don\u2019t do.\u201dIn addition to a coffee bar and an ice cream parlor, the complex will serve the greatest hits of Mike Isabella: tacos, a raw bar and Mediterranean, Italian and Japanese offerings.At a sushi tasting at Yona, one of his spots in Northern Virginia, Mr. Isabella plowed through giant plates of fish that were vying for a spot in its Tysons Galleria outpost.\u201cNo ponzo sauce, too mainstream,\u201d he said, waving off a slice of hamachi. A piece of fluke dressed up with shrimp paste he dismissed as \u201ca little too cheffy.\u201d A lobster roll drew an appreciative nod. Salmon nigiri with pea shoots and avocado and cucumber showed promise, he said, if the vegetables were cut smaller.Mr. Isabella looked tired, and reflexively grabbed for his phone. Tacos were next. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s very filling!\u201dSo clearly, Isabella Eatery will be the end?\u201cYes! No more D.C.!\u201d Mr. Isabella insisted. \u201cWell, maybe one more coffee shop.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the cost of the Wharf project.

{"Headline": "Google Serves Fake News Ads in an Unlikely Place: Fact-Checking Sites", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The headlines are eye-catching. Melania Trump is leaving the White House! Home renovation cable star Joanna Gaines has abandoned her HGTV show and husband Chip Gaines! Televangelist Joel Osteen is leaving his wife!According to an examination by The New York Times, the enticing headlines served as bait to draw readers to fraudulent sites that masqueraded as mainstream news sites, such as People and Vogue.The fake news ads all worked the same way: They would display headlines at the top of the fact-checking sites that, once clicked, took readers to sites that mimicked the logos and page designs of legitimate publications. The fake stories began with headlines and large photos of the celebrities in question, but after a few sentences, they transitioned into an ad for an anti-aging skin cream.The Snopes and PolitiFact ads show how broad the problem of online misinformation can be, said David Letzler, research scientist at Impact Radius, a digital marketing intelligence firm. \u201cEven websites whose mission is to promote accountability can inadvertently wind up getting used by snake oil salesmen,\u201d he said.Google declined to explain the specifics of how the fake news ads appeared on the fact-checking sites. The accounts that advertised on Snopes and PolitiFact were terminated from Google\u2019s ad platform after The Times asked about them, according to a person with knowledge of the sites who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential.\u201cAs always, when we find deceptive ad practices on our platforms we move swiftly to take action, including suspending the advertiser account if appropriate,\u201d Chi Hea Cho, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cIn addition, we give publishers controls so they can block specific types of ads and advertisers.\u201dWhen alerted to the ads promoting untrue stories on their sites, Snopes and PolitiFact said there was little they could do. Google\u2019s AdSense, which is used by web publishers to sell display advertising on their sites, works through automated tools. Often, advertisers are unsure where their ads are running \u2014 sometimes next to inappropriate or offensive content \u2014 and site owners don\u2019t know which ads will appear on their pages.Vinny Green, Snopes\u2019s co-owner and vice president, said it had tried to filter out misleading advertisements from the 150 million ads it displayed on its site last month. But that goes only so far.\u201cWe have little direct oversight or control over what is being done to filter out fake news ads being served on our site,\u201d he said in an email. He added that the online ad ecosystem was complicit in disseminating and profiting off of misinformation, and that \u201cthese ad quality problems are systemic.\u201dAaron Sharockman, executive director of PolitiFact, said it was working with Google to remove the \u201cquestionable text ads\u201d from its site.\u201cThe revenue those advertisements provide is critical to funding a website like ours, but it\u2019s equally important that we do everything we can to make sure the advertisements appearing on our site are not deceptive or intentionally misleading,\u201d he said.But the websites that advertised on Snopes and PolitiFact took a different approach. Those publishers paid Google to promote their content on legitimate websites to draw traffic for an ad pretending to be a news story, often carrying the banner of a mainstream news publication.The ad heralding the untrue story about Mrs. Trump\u2019s decision to leave Washington and the White House appeared at the top of PolitiFact last Friday. The display ad led to a fake Vogue news article claiming that the story was also featured on Yahoo, Vanity Fair and Time, among other publications.On another PolitiFact page, there was another display ad promoting a false story about Mr. Osteen, the leader of Lakewood Church, a Houston-based megachurch, leaving his wife because she had said too much on TV. When clicked, the ad went to a fake Us Weekly page about how Mrs. Osteen was leaving the church to focus on her skin cream company.The publisher of the fake Us Weekly site also bought a Google search ad, so that a query for the headline of the story \u201cSad News For Lakewood Church\u201d linked to that same fake story.Both PolitiFact and Snopes partnered with Facebook last December, after the social network was criticized for abetting the spread of fake news during the 2016 presidential election. Their experiment \u2014 in which viral and popular posts debunked by the fact checkers are marked as \u201cdisputed,\u201d and cannot be promoted in News Feeds \u2014 expanded and became more aggressive in August.David Carroll, an associate professor at the Parsons School of Design who has researched advertising technology and fake news, said Google and Facebook ultimately don\u2019t know enough about their customers \u2014 advertisers \u2014 making it too easy to game the system without serious repercussions.\u201cFor a few bucks, they allow anyone to target anyone else in the world,\u201d Mr. Carroll said. \u201cThe whole ecosystem has been infiltrated, and there is insufficient friction to keep bad actors out of the system.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Linda Qiu from Washington.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s one reason the financing ask is so high: Hollywood heavyweights cannot be convinced to do 10-minute video snippets unless they are paid what they are accustomed to being paid.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s hunch about the way a huge swath of consumers will watch television in the future is, in all likelihood, right. The number of teenagers and young adults who have their nose pressed to their mobile devices watching video content is startling. Globally, 72 percent of all video is viewed on a mobile device, according to Ooyala, a video platform provider.The question is whether his idea is ahead of its time. And whether he can find the right business model to support such expensive programing.Mr. Katzenberg is a realist. \u201cWe need $2 billion. That\u2019s a high bar,\u201d he said. And he acknowledges that the financial details still need to be worked out. It\u2019s daunting. He needs to build an instant library of content \u2014 and a big one.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s gamble is being taken seriously because of his long history of success and his provocative thesis about the current television model. \u201cThe design and the architecture of the storytelling fit the business paradigm, not the other way around,\u201d he explained, suggesting that shows were made in the format of a half-hour or an hour for business reasons and do not make sense in the world of mobile devices and streaming.He also took a shot at all the advertising on network programs. \u201cI would actually make the argument that one of the challenges for network TV has been that they\u2019ve actually busted the form by asking people to watch 19 minutes of commercial time inside of 60 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-two percent of your watch time is watching commercials.\u201dInstead, Mr. Katzenberg is hoping to create a premium network that will probably rely on a combination of subscription fees and advertising \u2014 \u00e0 la Spotify. He does not believe he will put television companies out of business; in fact, he needs them as partners and believes they can live side by side.But Mr. Katzenberg does not want to simply create a studio that specializes in short-form storytelling; he wants to create a platform for it. He is hoping that many of the big television networks both invest and produce content for the service.\u201cThis is literally a true moment in time here in which we\u2019re going to create a new form, a new format, a new platform, new content and we\u2019re going to supply that content and we\u2019re going to let them,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg said of the big networks, \u201cgrab what ultimately will be the biggest value here by owning the platform.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve all grown up with this idea that content is king,\u201d he said, explaining his rationale for trying to create a new service rather than simply creating the content itself. \u201cAnd I realized, it actually isn\u2019t. Content is the king maker, it\u2019s not the king. The king is the platform. HBO is the king. Netflix is the king. Spotify is the king.\u201dWhen I mentioned to Mr. Katzenberg that well-heeled competitors like Apple and Facebook are getting into the television business and may seek to innovate the form, he was unfazed.\u201cThis idea that Apple and Facebook and YouTube are now coming into Hollywood with these billions of dollars and are in fact going to change the enterprise of television is actually wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything new or different or unique. It simply broadens the offering and it may broaden the destinations that you can go to, but in fact that fragmentation at some point is going to implode.\u201dMr. Katzenberg believes he is offering something that will start the next leg of growth in the industry.Executives who have seen Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s plan, including Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, and Leslie Moonves of CBS, have expressed enthusiasm for the project.Still, there are skeptics. Several media executives pointed to Nielsen data showing that traditional television still accounts for the bulk of the video viewing among people over 18 years old in the United States. (The country is far behind other nations in video mobile viewing.)And of course there is the question of what kind of content consumers want to watch on a phone. So far, most short-form content has been relatively cheap to produce, because of lower production quality, and customers have willingly watched it. Who\u2019s to say they are craving HBO-level production quality? And many viewers are happy to watch Netflix on a mobile device and press pause on their favorite show or movie and return to it later.But Mr. Katzenberg says that to think about it like that is backward. There is always an opportunity to create a premium product, he said, and there will be \u201ca pretty meaningful subset of people who would actually pay for it.\u201dTo Mr. Katzenberg, the idea is too obvious not to pursue. \u201cYou have an installed base of one and a half billion people who watch 45 minutes of video on a smartphone every day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is where I say to you, \u2018They\u2019re drinking water. We\u2019re going to give it to them in a bottle.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

She said all the right things,\u201d Representative Donald M. Payne Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said of Ms. Sandberg. But he was not satisfied. \u201cI had an uncle who hated when you said \u2018gonna\u2019: \u2018I\u2019m gonna do this, and I\u2019m gonna do that.\u2019 He used to say, \u2018Don\u2019t be a gonna.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I said to her, \u2018Don\u2019t be a gonna.\u2019\u201dWhile Facebook has yet to release any of the ads, it has hired three crisis communications firms, bought digital and newspaper ads and sent Ms. Sandberg to Washington last week to charm Congress and the public.But the grievance of black lawmakers is a particular one: As black activists tried last year to focus attention on police brutality, unfair treatment before the law, inequality and white supremacy, social media giants like Facebook were being commandeered by Russian intelligence agents to turn white voters against them.For Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, the moment recalled the 1970s, when another government, this one in Washington, not Moscow, targeted black activists. She served as a community worker for the Black Panther Party as the F.B.I. used false information to go after its members.\u201cThat actually got people killed and destroyed organizations,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cNow look at Facebook allowing ads by the Russian government to create this kind of environment. That\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re even aware of the history and how dangerous allowing the promotion of division and racial animosity and racial hatred can be.\u201dAnd nearly a year after the election, black lawmakers say, little is being done to reverse the damage. Russia studied and exploited the \u201cfault lines of racial tension,\u201d said Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York, and multiple investigations into Russia\u2019s actions and the Trump\u2019s campaign possible involvement have thus far offered no safeguards to stop Moscow\u2019s efforts.\u201cThings are moving far too slow because we should be putting protective measures in place,\u201d Ms. Clarke said. \u201cWe need to step up to the challenge.\u201dDuring the meeting, Ms. Sandberg frequently said she agreed as more than a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus demanded action from the company. Several people in the meeting said Ms. Sandberg frequently said, \u201cWe will do better\u201d and \u201cYou will get answers.\u201dBut her answers fueled the anger of some black lawmakers who said for years that they have been pushing Facebook to add a black person to its all-white board of directors and to diversify its staff. Several members have also written letters to Facebook and other companies demanding answers related to the presidential election.On Thursday, the company\u2019s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, said in the meeting that Facebook had recently hired a record number of minority employees, and Ms. Sandberg promised that the company planned to add a black person to its board.\u201cPeople get all worked up on the internet and do crazy things, and some of us are the recipients of their insanity,\u201d Mr. Cleaver said. \u201cIt feels like the whole country is changing, and we\u2019re having a national nervous breakdown.\u201dFor others, the anger is more with Moscow than Silicon Valley. Already, they say, the United States has to deal with the remnants of slavery, institutional racism in schools and the criminal justice system, and now a foreign adversary is stirring a boiling pot.Shortly after the meeting with Ms. Sandberg, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he was concerned that the F.B.I. may have bought into Russia\u2019s exploitation of African-Americans with its new class of threats called \u201cBlack Identity Extremists.\u201d Mr. Richmond said that he feared that the F.B.I. may now go after black people who protest unfair policing practices and discriminatory policies based on false information peddled on social media.\u201cThis is a very fragile moment in time for African-Americans across this country,\u201d Mr. Richmond said. \u201cWhat we needed Facebook to understand is that they play a role in the perception of African-Americans.\u201dRepresentative Robin Kelly, a Democrat of Illinois, said she often hears from constituents who want to know why the investigations have taken so long. Ms. Kelly is also the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Information Technology and sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats. Neither panel has had a hearing on Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election, she said.\u201cI don\u2019t know the intelligence process, and I\u2019m sure they want to be thorough and all of that,\u201d she said. But, she added, \u201cpeople are anxious.\u201dAt least some members of the caucus have started thinking about what ways Congress may have to step in and shield Americans from Russia\u2019s influence.Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, said lawmakers may need to come up with new ways to combat false information and fight back against Russia. That might mean Facebook would face new regulations.\u201cOur concerns will not get ignored,\u201d Ms. Watson Coleman said. \u201cIt\u2019s either you clean up your act, or government will have to act in that space.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Socialite Enters Race to Challenge President Putin", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A young socialite and television journalist whose father was a close ally of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, declared her intention on Wednesday to challenge him in the presidential election scheduled for next March, a move liable to split the already feeble liberal opposition.\u201cYou want to show your active position, but your candidate is not authorized to run? You don\u2019t have a candidate? Tick Sobchak,\u201d she wrote in the newspaper. \u201cYou\u2019re just using a legal and peaceful opportunity to say \u2018Enough! I\u2019m fed up with this!\u2019\u201dHe has been campaigning anyway, and set up campaign offices across the country, a rare move for someone without the backing of a mainstream party.\u201cHe said that every person can make their own decisions and take responsibility for them too,\u201d said Ms. Sobchak. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that he liked my decision.\u201cDmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, described Ms. Sobchak as \u201ctalented\u201d in a comment to TV Rain but suggested that she had a lot to learn.\u201cShe\u2019ll have to make herself familiar with this from scratch,\u201d Mr. Peskov said. \u201cPolitics is different from journalism and from show business. This is a completely different matter.\u201dSome leaders of the liberal opposition expressed dismay, accusing her of being a Kremlin stooge and a spoiler candidate meant to inject a measure of excitement and legitimacy into a dull race. Mr. Putin, having run Russia as president or prime minister for almost 18 years, is due to seek his fourth term as president with no real opposition. He has yet to formally announce that he will run, but is expected to do so by December.Sergey Udaltsov, a political activist recently released from prison, compared it to the last campaign, in 2012, when many believed that the Kremlin convinced Mikhail D. Prokhorov, a billionaire businessman and the principal owner of the Brooklyn Nets, to run.Mr. Navalny and his top aides are serving yet another brief prison sentence over their campaign organizing, so they could not respond to the formal announcement. But the two camps were already sniping at each other last month, when rumors that Ms. Sobchak might run first began to circulate.Ms. Sobchak said in her TV interview that she hoped to gain Mr. Navalny\u2019s support after he is released, and said she would discuss withdrawing if he were somehow allowed to run.In her work as a television journalist and talk-show host, Ms. Sobchak has been unofficially banned as a presenter on state television since she joined the anti-Kremlin protests in 2012. Some portrayed her candidacy as a means to escape from the confines of TV Rain, which can only be watched online or on cable.\u201cShe is too glamorous for Navalny\u2019s electorate, but she can be supported by people who are protesting against the country becoming increasingly conservative, by people who are against clericalism,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, a political analyst and deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank.Although it is impossible to gauge her support at this early stage, he said her main motivation seemed personal. \u201cSobchak doesn\u2019t want to create a party,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cI think she wants to be a star.\u201dOthers were taken with the idea.\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t like Navalny\u2019s dictatorial tendencies and believe that Sobchak is a good candidate to consolidate representatives of the liberal opposition,\u201d said Vladislav Inozemtsev, a political analyst who leads the Center for Post-Industrial Studies, another Moscow think tank.\u201cRussia needs a leader who will be more of a visionary, instead of a manager with a lot of experience at stealing government money or being obsequious to the superiors,\u201d he said. \u201cIn any case, this leader should be a modern, open-minded person. In these terms, Ksenia is an ideal candidate.\u201dThere are considerable hurdles for any opposition candidates entering the presidential race, and particularly a woman. A candidate has to be either nominated by a party in the federal Parliament, called the Duma, or collect 300,000 signatures from at least 40 Russian regions. The latter is considered impossible without vast financial resources or months of organizing.TV Rain said Ms. Sobchak\u2019s campaign adviser would be Vitali Shkliarov, a Russian who worked on Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign in the United States. In recent months, Mr. Shkliarov has been preaching the gospel of a more equitable, more disruptive political process in Russia, pushing many novice politicians to run successfully for seats in local municipal councils in Moscow.Over all, the general sense was that whether she was a Kremlin stooge or not, the entrance of a glamorous young woman into mainstream Russian politics would make what many consider a farcical race even more fantastic.Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

We took steps to disrupt this activity and reported details to the relevant authorities.In this white paper, we noted the challenge of attributing threat activity to foreign actors ourselves, but we specifically referenced the assessment of the U.S. government that this actor was tied to Russia\u2019s intelligence services. This was an accurate statement of what we knew about this particular actor at the time, and it appropriately relied on the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s public analysis.We have been forthcoming at every opportunity about what we know about these information operations. In addition to our white paper, last month we disclosed advertising activity on our platform that we believe is linked to the Internet Research Agency, a different group from the one we described in April.

{"Headline": "Revulsion in Italian Soccer Over Anti-Semitic Taunts", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 In the more than 70 years since the Nazis discovered Anne Frank\u2019s hiding place and then murdered her in a concentration camp, the Jewish girl\u2019s diary entries \u2014 brimming with life and optimism in the face of utter despair \u2014 have been read in classrooms, libraries and war zones around the world.In Italy on Wednesday, her sentences resounded over the loudspeakers of soccer stadiums, a response to the shock and disgust felt by the country\u2019s political, cultural and Jewish leaders after fans of Lazio, one of Rome\u2019s teams, had left stickers in a stadium with the image of Frank wearing the colors of a crosstown rival to mock that team\u2019s supporters. Some Lazio fans have been known to engage in anti-Semitic behavior, and the association with Frank was meant to be taken as an insult.Casual racism is frequent in Italian soccer \u2014 the president of the Italian Football Federation once bemoaned \u201cbanana eaters\u201d entering Italy\u2019s leagues \u2014 and hateful chants among ultras, or extreme fans, are the norm. Still, the appearance of postcard-size stickers of Frank wearing the red-and-yellow jacket of Lazio\u2019s rival, A.S. Roma, has struck a nerve.Mr. Smulevich and many others noted that any association with Frank was always considered an honor, not an insult, and reflected more on the ignorance of those who would use her image to cast aspersions.\u201cUsing her image as a sign of insult and threat is, besides being inhumane, alarming for our country, which, 80 years ago was infected by the cruelty of anti-Semitism,\u201d said President Sergio Mattarella of Italy.He was far from alone in his condemnation.The country\u2019s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, called the images \u201cunbelievable, unacceptable and not to be minimized.\u201d Antonio Tajani, the Italian president of the European Parliament, condemned the \u201chooligans\u201d who used Frank\u2019s image to give offense, reminding people that the Jewish community was part of \u201cour European Union\u201d and that anti-Semitism had to remain \u201ca horrible experience of our past.\u201dMatteo Renzi, the country\u2019s former prime minister and the leader of the Democratic Party, wrote on Facebook, \u201cIf I was the president of a soccer club, I\u2019d go down to the field tomorrow with the Star of David instead of the sponsor.\u201dThe country\u2019s newspapers have published pictures of Anne Frank on the front pages alongside excoriating columns.\u201cWe are all Anne Frank,\u201d read a front-page headline in Tuesday\u2019s editions of La Repubblica, under images of Frank smiling and wearing different Italian soccer jerseys. Wednesday\u2019s editions of Corriere della Sera, the country\u2019s leading newspaper, carried a soul-searching essay by one of Italy\u2019s leading authors, Alessandro Piperno, who is both Jewish and a lifelong fan of Lazio. \u201cPlease free us from the grotesque, and clean up the stadiums from this horrendous mob,\u201d he wrote.As of Thursday, the Roman police, combing through video footage from the stadium, had identified 20 people \u2014 some of them as young as 13 and others already barred from the stadium for violence \u2014 who appeared to have put up the stickers, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.The ultra fans of Lazio usually occupy the northern curve of Olympic Stadium, which they share with their A.S. Roma rivals. (While Roma has a following among the city\u2019s Jewish community, their fans have also written \u201cAnne Frank roots for Lazio\u201d on city walls.)On Sunday, Lazio\u2019s ultras found themselves in the section on the opposite side of the stadium, the southern section where Roma fans usually sit during home games. The Lazio fans had lost rights to their beloved northern section as punishment for an incident earlier this month in which fans sang racist chants directed at a player on the opposing team who was born in Italy to Ghanaian parents.After the game, cleaning crews found the stickers of Frank stuck to plexiglass walls, immediately prompting outrage.From the team\u2019s management, there were more familiar rituals of contrition.The owner of Lazio, which is otherwise having a good season, visited a Rome synagogue and laid a wreath of flowers in the team\u2019s blue and white colors. With \u201cthis gesture,\u201d the owner, Claudio Lotito, said he wanted to make his position \u201cclear and resolute,\u201d but then he offered only to help educate young Lazio fans about \u201ccertain phenomena\u201d and promised to sponsor an annual trip to Auschwitz for 200 of them.Some Jewish leaders clearly found the statement lukewarm.Rome\u2019s chief rabbi, Riccardo Di Segni, characterized the pilgrimage as a publicity stunt. \u201cThis community is not a washing machine or a place where you can show up with a floral tribute and resolve everything,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, the wreath ended up tossed into the Tiber River, and an Italian newspaper ran a recording of Mr. Lotito appearing to refer to the ceremony at the synagogue as a \u201cshow.\u201dIndeed, all of Italian soccer seemed to read off the same damage-control script on Wednesday, as team captains and referees held copies of Primo Levi\u2019s Holocaust memoir, \u201cIf This Is a Man,\u201d and listened to a reading from Frank\u2019s diary.But some fans seemed less than moved.In Turin, some fans turned their backs to the field and sang the Italian national anthem. In Rome, some Roma fans kept on with their usual team chants.And in Bologna, where Lazio played an away game, some of their ultra fans took their places in stands dedicated to a Jewish coach who had fled Italy\u2019s racial laws before his death in Auschwitz in 1944. They chanted the Mussolini blackshirts\u2019 slogan, \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn,\u201d while Lazio players took the field wearing white T-shirts with Frank\u2019s face above the words \u201cNo to anti-Semitism.\u201dThe players on both sides listened respectfully as the announcer read Frank\u2019s words: \u201cI hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too. I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and tranquillity will return once more.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After ordering all of the generators he could find in the United States, he has turned to a cache he found in Canada.\u201cWe are in that cycle of finding and bringing, and finding and bringing,\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez said. The generator everyone wants, he said, is a $6,000 model that can run a home air-conditioning system. The biggest model he had in stock this week was a $2,300 machine that can run a refrigerator, some lights, a washing machine \u2014 but not an air conditioner.For one customer, Victor Negr\u00f3n, it would have to do. He said his old generator had given out two days earlier. \u201cI\u2019ve had to go to hotels to charge my phones,\u201d said Mr. Negr\u00f3n, 50, a health care executive. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost all of the food in our refrigerator.\u201dThe Trump administration has asked Congress to approve a $29 billion aid package for Puerto Rico, as well as for hurricane-damaged Florida and Texas. But in the days after September 20, when Hurricane Maria strafed Puerto Rico, Prepa\u2019s money troubles made it \u201calmost impossible\u201d to pay the large contracts required to bring in other states\u2019 power companies to help restore the grid, said Jos\u00e9 E. S\u00e1nchez, a director with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the head of the task force to restore power in Puerto Rico.\u201cIt is not only personnel, but all the trucks and materials,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez said in an email. \u201cThat could cost millions of dollars.\u201dBut Meena Dayak, a spokeswoman for the American Public Power Association, the trade group that coordinates the state-to-state mutual aid networks for public power utilities, said that Prepa never reached out to them for help.\u201cThe way our mutual aid works is we can only go in if help has been requested,\u201d she said over the phone on Friday.Mr. Ramos, Prepa\u2019s chief executive, said he did request help but when none came, he hired a Montana-based company, Whitefish Energy Holdings, to restore many of the power lines. Mr. Ramos said 200 subcontractors were already on the ground.Andy Techmanski, chief executive of Whitefish, said that a shortage of housing for his crews meant that only 75 were on the island, and that clogged ports were making it a challenge to bring in heavy equipment.He also said it would take six months or longer for all of Puerto Rico to have its power restored.But Mr. S\u00e1nchez said that the assignment from the Federal Emergency Management Authority is to repair the system only. \u201cWe are there to repair-replace, but not to augment,\u201d he said.As he waited to buy his generator, Mr. Negr\u00f3n sympathized with the governor. The island needed a better power system, he said. But people did not want to wait. His mother, he said, \u201cwants her electric now.\u201dAcross town at the Costco, Juan Torres, an assistant manager, showed off the massive, truck-size generator that the business, like many here, had installed before the storm. Mr. Torres said it was burning 1,000 gallons of diesel per day.But Mr. Torres said that home generators normally offered at the store were sold out.Across the island, the Army Corps of Engineers has set up 34 huge generators so far, running everything from police departments to water pumping facilities to a Prepa office, according to Lisa Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Corps. Corps officials said on Friday that 177 other generators arrived late in the week, with some of them headed to the United States Virgin Islands.Camilla Feibelman, a founder of the Puerto Rico chapter of the Sierra Club who currently runs the Rio Grande chapter, said that Facebook was full of complaints about the generator noise on the island these days.More seriously, she said, generators can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning when misused \u2014 a common concern among officials in post-storm environments. Last month, three people in Orange County, Fla., died from carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator inside their homes.Adriana Gonz\u00e1lez, a Sierra Club organizer in Puerto Rico, said the high cost of a generator \u201ccreates a disparity\u201d between rich and poor. In her neighborhood, she said, \u201cyou have one house illuminated, and then total darkness for like a block.\u201dMr. Ram\u00edrez, the Honda store manager, said that some generators were stolen from the showroom in the days just after the storm. So the store now makes the sale in the showroom, then has customers pick up their generators from a warehouse a day later.If nothing else, it is a good time to be a generator repairman like Jos\u00e9 Miguel M\u00e1rquez, 35. Mr. M\u00e1rquez said he was so busy these days that the biggest problem is finding time to deposit his checks at the bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "FeatureAs a young social psychologist, she played by the rules and won big: an influential study, a viral TED talk, a prestigious job at Harvard. Then, suddenly, the rules changed.Supported byThat visual might have escaped me altogether, except that Cuddy, a social psychologist, is best known to the public for her work on body language. And hers seemed to embody a divide that had characterized her life in the last couple of years, a sense of two selves, one highly sensitive, the other more confident, even skilled in the art of conveying that confidence.The study impressed not only Cuddy\u2019s colleagues \u2014 it was published in the prestigious journal Psychological Science \u2014 but also CNN, Oprah magazine and, inevitably, someone at the TED conference, which invited Cuddy to speak in 2012. In the talk, Cuddy was commanding; she was also confessional, telegenic, empathetic. She really wanted the audience members to ace their job interviews, to find confidence in the face of nerves, and she had a plan, a science-supported life hack, for how to do it: the power pose. \u201cDon\u2019t fake it till you make it \u2014 fake it till you become it,\u201d she told the audience, before urging them to share the science of power posing with others who might need that boost: \u201cIt can significantly change the outcomes of their life.\u201dBut since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology\u2019s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation \u2014 as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy\u2019s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another \u2014 even if it clearly did not \u2014 if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. \u201cThey felt the urgency of history,\u201d says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. \u201cThey really wanted to make people look.\u201dSince the late 1960s, the field\u2019s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists\u2019 shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people\u2019s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling \u201cTipping Point,\u201d applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller \u201cStumbling on Happiness\u201d \u2014 a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists\u2019 insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person \u2014 but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer \u2014 in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet \u2014 but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy\u2019s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students\u2019 \u2014 self-protective, insecure \u2014 would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph\u2019s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as \u201cself-reported feelings of power\u201d). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a \u201cdownstream effect\u201d \u2014 a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects\u2019 willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.\u201cI remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,\u201d Cuddy says. \u201cEverything went in the direction it was supposed to.\u201d The abstract that they eventually wrote \u2014 that their editors approved \u2014 reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: \u201cThat a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.\u201dCuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary\u2019s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies\u2019 findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were \u201cinto thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.\u201dAfter finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. \u201cHow can something not be possible to cause something else?\u201d Nelson says. \u201cOh, you reverse time, then it can\u2019t.\u201d And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved \u2014 or even more extreme ones \u2014 if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance \u2014 also the hurdle to considering a study publishable \u2014 has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers\u2019 birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song \u201cWhen I\u2019m Sixty-Four\u201d; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music \u201cKalimba\u201d). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: \u201cHow Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.\u201d It was witty, it was relatable \u2014 everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.\u201cWe realized entire literatures could be false positives,\u201d Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. \u201cI P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn\u2019t get interesting results,\u201d Simmons says.The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead \u2014 the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. \u201cThe whole room was like, \u2018Oh, my God, what just happened?\u2019\u2009\u201d recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society\u2019s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society\u2019s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.\u201cI regret it,\u201d Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist\u2019s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift \u2014 one of tone \u2014 that would affect the field almost as drastically.For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.But in the years after that Society for Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. \u201cAll of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,\u201d says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. \u201cThat was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.\u201d Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble \u2014 who could argue with better science? \u2014 but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers\u2019 motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as \u201cshameless little bullies.\u201d)Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. \u201cIt is terrifying, even if it\u2019s fair and within normal scientific bounds,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause of social media and how it travels \u2014 you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That\u2019s horrifying for anyone who\u2019s critiqued, even if it\u2019s legitimate.\u201dThe field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. \u201cIn the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,\u201d says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. \u201cIt was like we had been having a big party \u2014 what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.\u201dThere were several key differences \u2014 Ranehill\u2019s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time \u2014 six minutes of standing versus two \u2014 was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. \u201cIt\u2019s not a crazy thing to test,\u201d Cuddy says. \u201cI guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way \u2014 three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let\u2019s see.\u201dShe was relieved to see that the \u201cfeelings of power\u201d finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding\u2019s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone\u2019s feelings. \u201cWe\u2019re psychologists,\u201d she says. \u201cWe try to change how people feel.\u201d She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects \u2014 more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill\u2019s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people\u2019s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field\u2019s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,\u201d one psychologist said.In the wake of Ranehill\u2019s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that \u201cconceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate\u201d but that they should take the P-curve out. \u201cEverybody wins in that case.\u201d According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said \u2014 they took out the P-curve.A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons\u2019s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. \u201cHe\u2019ll say his piece, and you\u2019ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,\u201d Bilz told Cuddy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.\u201dCuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. \u201cWe embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, \u2018You were wrong,\u2019\u2009\u201d Simonsohn said. \u201cPeople won\u2019t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It\u2019s not something people want to hear.\u201dThe post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn\u2019s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on \u201cself-reported power,\u201d although the language made it clear that it didn\u2019t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect \u2014 a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. \u201cPeople were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,\u201d Cuddy says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018We send our condolences,\u2019 \u2018Holy crap, this is terrible\u2019 and \u2018God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can\u2019t.\u2019\u2009\u201d She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field\u2019s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to \u201cmore progress on this important topic.\u201d Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated \u2014 of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.On his site, Cuddy\u2019s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. \u201cShe has no serious conception of \u2018science,\u2019\u2009\u201d one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy\u2019s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.\u201d Gelman replied, \u201cA head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,\u201d pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (\u201cPeople send me things, and I respond,\u201d he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. \u201cI would like her to say: \u2018Jeez, I didn\u2019t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bad person, and it didn\u2019t get replicated\u2019 \u2014 rather than salvaging as much as she can.\u201dGelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. \u201cWhy not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?\u201d she wondered aloud to me. \u201cWhy not come to a conference or hold a seminar?\u201d When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.\u201cI don\u2019t like interpersonal conflict,\u201d he said.It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her \u201ca profiteer,\u201d not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy\u2019s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. \u201cWhen people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?\u201d he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, \u201cit was not too late.\u201d Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn\u2019s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn\u2019t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study\u2019s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work \u2014 the hit to her reputation \u2014 with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy\u2019s conviction in the research.For much of the scientific world, Carney\u2019s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. \u201cWhoa! This is how to do it!\u201d tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.To Cuddy, Carney\u2019s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney\u2019s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. \u201cIf I do a bad job proving there\u2019s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a ninth planet,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.\u201dLess than two weeks after Carney\u2019s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work \u2014 and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn\u2019s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. \u201cWe did say to drop the graph, didn\u2019t we?\u201d He read it over again, then sat back. \u201cI didn\u2019t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about \u2014 that email is too polite.\u201dCuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. \u201cShe was great,\u201d he said, smiling at the memory. \u201cWe published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. \u2026\u2009\u201d He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. \u201cThe original study wasn\u2019t particularly egregious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.\u201dFor a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. \u201cI wish,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.\u201dEven people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. \u201cIt\u2019s become like politics \u2014 we\u2019ve created two camps of people who shouldn\u2019t be in two camps in the first place,\u201d says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. \u201cIt\u2019s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance \u2014 and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It\u2019s terrible for science. It\u2019s not good.\u201dIf Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. \u201cAmy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts \u2014 I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,\u201d Van Bavel says. \u201cI\u2019ve only been in it for 15 years, but I\u2019ve never seen public humiliation like that.\u201dAs a result, the breadth of the accusations \u2014 how diffuse they are \u2014 could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. \u201cWe were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there \u2014 there were conferences and panels on how to do it,\u201d says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. \u201cOne of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.\u201dI was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy\u2019s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. \u201cWhy does everyone care so much about what Amy says?\u201d Brian Nosek says. \u201cScience isn\u2019t about consensus.\u201d Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. \u201cAuthors love their findings,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you can defend almost anything \u2014 that\u2019s the norm of science, not just in psychology.\u201d He still considers Cuddy a \u201cvery serious psychologist\u201d; he also believes the 2010 paper \u201cis a bunch of nonsense.\u201d But he says, \u201cIt does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.\u201dCuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: \u201cBullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.\u201d It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.An earlier version of this article misstated the type of recently published research in which no downstream behavioral effects of power posing were seen. It was 11 new studies, not 11 new papers.An article on Oct. 22 about the social psychologist Amy Cuddy referred incorrectly to the number of social psychologists who participated in a survey assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. It was 350, not 700. The article also quoted incorrectly from a response Cuddy wrote to a blog that criticized a paper she helped write on power posing. She said she was looking forward to \u201cmore progress on this important topic,\u201d not \u201cmore research.\u201d And the article misstated part of the name of a professional organization of social psychologists. It is the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, not the Society of.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I Almost Fired My Doctor", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI always liked my primary care doctor personally. He routinely welcomed me to his office with a cheery hello and a smile. We asked about each other\u2019s children. We often discussed our respective exercise regimens, running in his case and pickup basketball in mine. For more than 20 years, we even confided about our ambitions as writers.But I often questioned his judgment in medical matters.Take, for example, the time my neck bothered me. I complained to him about frequent soreness and stiffness \u2013 probably a result of spending hours planted in front of a computer. He suggested I obtain a neck brace to wear while working. \u201cIs that necessary?\u201d I asked him. No, he said.At no point did he ask me where my neck hurt, or how much, or how often. He never physically examined my neck, nor instructed me to turn my head in order to observe my range of motion. He neglected to propose I do specific exercises to rehabilitate my neck or get a new chair or just take frequent breaks from sitting at a keyboard.Rather, he advised me to see an orthopedist or physiatrist. He also printed out some medical journal articles about neck problems for me to read, all well over my head.Some time later, my annual physical revealed my overall cholesterol level to be borderline high. \u201cI should probably put you on a statin,\u201d my doctor said. \u201cI could prescribe Lipitor.\u201d \u201cWould that be necessary?\u201d I asked him. No, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a trend that reflects the state of medicine today,\u201d Dr. Danielle Ofri, associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and author of \u201cWhat Patients Say, What Doctors Hear,\u201d told me. \u201cPhysicians are so risk-averse they prescribe medications as a default and reflexively refer patients to specialists. It\u2019s systemic.\u201dWhat to do? After all, this was my health here. As a lifelong recreational athlete and fitness enthusiast, I\u2019d entered my 60s healthy, but eventually \u2013 inevitably \u2013 my age would catch up with me. Was I going to risk my longevity to avoid hurting my doctor\u2019s feelings? I needed a physician I respected and trusted. Should I stick with the status quo or take a hike?\u201cYour experience is more common than was the case even 20 years ago,\u201d Dr. Michael Fleming, former president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told me. \u201cIt can be very frustrating to be a patient nowadays. That\u2019s why they\u2019re more inclined to switch doctors than ever before.\u201dMy most recent appointment with my doctor made reaching a decision much easier. For years, he discussed my health with me in his office while typing his observations into an electronic health record on his computer. He would turn sideways to talk with me, then look back at his screen. He typically looked at the computer more than at me, but at least I could see his face.Clearly I now had to turn my back on my doctor, too. The big question was, how? How do you go about firing your longtime doctor? Does the American Medical Association recommend a protocol? Do you just say, \u201cYour services are no longer required?\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve decided to take my health in a different direction?\u201d Or \u201cForgive me, but I need to start seeing someone else?\u201d\u201cSo many patients have no idea about how to approach this struggle, and they feel bad about the idea,\u201d George Blackall, associate professor at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and co-author of \u201cBreaking the Cycle: How to Turn Conflict Into Collaboration When You and Your Patients Disagree,\u201d told me. \u201cYou should reach out to talk to your doctor. That\u2019s the key. Make clear how you feel. Say what you need.\u201dAs I agonized over my decision, a Facebook friend who also goes to my doctor delivered a surprise: She posted a message saying that he would be retiring soon. So I called his office to verify. Yes, the receptionist told me, he would be retiring next month.So I was spared having to tell him I was defecting, and I\u2019ll soon be seeing another doctor anyway. Mine quit his job before my health went on me (and possibly before his did, too). As it turns out, he\u2019s done me a big favor. Ending his career just might have saved my life.An earlier version of this article misidentified Dr. Tait Shanafelt. He was director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s program on physician well-being at the time he was quoted, but he has since left that position.Bob Brody, a former health care journalist in New York City, is the author of the memoir \u201cPlaying Catch With Strangers: A Family Guy (Reluctantly) Comes Of Age.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hitch a Ride on de Blasio\u2019s Coattails? A Brooklyn Democrat Says No Thanks", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn search of votes less than two weeks before Election Day, John F. Quaglione rapped on the door of a home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, with a yard decked out for Halloween. A shirtless man answered.\u201cWhat do I think of de Blasio?\u201d the man said to Mr. Quaglione, a Republican who is hoping to gain a seat on the solidly blue New York City Council. \u201cCome on! He should be in my garden.\u201dThe man, who declined to give his name, nodded in the direction of his lawn decorations: a large witch, a skeleton mummy and many glowing skulls.Mayor Bill de Blasio elicits strong feelings from many in this otherwise quiet corner of single-family homes and short apartment buildings along Brooklyn\u2019s southwestern edge.Although polls indicate that Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, is likely to win re-election easily on Nov. 7, his unpopularity here, in the 43rd Council District, is such that he has not campaigned for the Democratic candidate, Justin L. Brannan, who worked on the mayor\u2019s prekindergarten program as a political liaison at the Education Department.None of the mayor\u2019s flash point issues \u2014 his trip to Germany a day after a police officer\u2019s death; a controversy over a Christopher Columbus statue; a former militant marching in the Puerto Rican Day Parade \u2014 have resonated in the mayoral race, but they do here.\u201cI do think those issues will be a factor,\u201d said Frank Seddio, the chairman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party. \u201cThis is the heart of the resistance against the mayor.\u201dUnlike most Democrats seeking Council seats in New York, Mr. Brannan, 39, is facing stiff opposition in the general election from Mr. Quaglione, 38, a law-and-order candidate who supports President Trump. The mayor offered to help, but Mr. Brannan said he turned him down.\u201cBy definition, the Council serves as a check on the mayor; to be endorsed by the guy you\u2019re supposed to serve as a check on doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d Mr. Brannan said, adding that \u201cmy opponents love to blame de Blasio for every cloud in the sky.\u201dThat discontent has fueled one of the few competitive general election fights of 2017.At a recent debate, one of several in the local campaign, cultural issues over which the Council has no control, like abortion, were discussed nearly as much as local concerns, like poor transit service, illegal conversions of homes, and the appearance of those who appear to be homeless.The district covers the neighborhoods of Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights and Bensonhurst, and represents a diverse collection of recent and long-ago immigrants, including those from the Middle East, Greece, Italy and China.Often considered a conservative bastion, the area has diversified in the 14 years that it has been represented by a single Democratic councilman, Vincent Gentile, who cannot run for another term. Mr. Albanese won the local Council seat in the 1980s from a Republican, and the seat changed party twice more. It still includes an area represented by Ms. Malliotakis, whose Assembly district extends from eastern Staten Island to parts of Bay Ridge, and by Martin J. Golden, the only state Senate Republican from Brooklyn.\u201cThey\u2019re doing less well than they used to do,\u201d Mr. Gentile said of the Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s very much middle-of-the-road Democrats.\u201d He added that new and younger residents include many who are more left-of-center. (The 51-member Council currently has only three Republican members, and none are from Brooklyn.)Mr. Quaglione, a father of two who lives in Bay Ridge and worked for Mr. Golden since college, hoped to reverse that trend by tying Mr. Brannan to the mayor, and focusing on quality-of-life concerns.Less frequent, but more common, are those scavenging for bottles and cans. Along a stretch of 78th Street in Bensonhurst, where he went door-to-door on a recent Friday afternoon, signs warned in English and Chinese not to collect cans and bottles from private garbage. Mr. Quaglione has pledged to advocate to abolish the state\u2019s 5-cent redemption.\u201cI have to chase them away,\u201d said Michele Ngai, 47, of the people who rummage through her trash. \u201cYou have my vote,\u201d she said to Mr. Quaglione, standing in her driveway. \u201cBottles, bottles.\u201dWith a campaign volunteer, Christopher McCreight, Mr. Brannan left the school to knock on doors among stately homes off Ridge Boulevard and more modest ones near Fourth Avenue.\u201cI don\u2019t like our present mayor,\u201d a woman, Stella Arsenakos, 55, told Mr. Brannan as they stood on her porch. But she said she would support Mr. Brannan. \u201cHe lives in the neighborhood,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knows our area.\u201dMr. Brannan\u2019s main promise is to address crowded schools by opening a new one in the district within his first term.Most voters, he said, were concerned about hyperlocal issues. But for some, there is \u201cthis almost cartoonish allegiance to headlines, tabloid headlines,\u201d he said, of being asked about the Columbus statue and similar issues. \u201cSome folks see that as a litmus test.\u201d\u201cI took it to mean, Love your city,\u201d Mr. Brannan said of his pin.\u201cTake it off,\u201d Mr. McCreight joked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Me Too\u2019 Movement Inevitably Spills Into Sports", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesThere were more names. Of course there were.This time, the brave athlete stepping forward was McKayla Maroney, an Olympic champion who posted a Twitter message on Wednesday morning that was shocking, yet \u2014 sadly \u2014 not so shocking at all.I have my own \u201cMe Too\u201d stories. Many women do. And to be crystal clear, my experiences were very different from what Maroney and the other gymnasts have described, which includes accusations of serious crimes: a doctor molesting dozens of minors during his long career. But distinguishing levels of harassment, or abuse, or rape is not the point of any of this. The point is to stop this \u2014 all of this.So far, more than 140 women, including athletes who competed at the highest levels of gymnastics, have come forward to say that Nassar had touched them inappropriately during medical appointments. Unlike Weinstein, Nassar is in jail, awaiting trial on multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct. He already has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges \u2014 he denies the many accusations of sexual assault \u2014 and faces decades of prison time.Regardless of how many charges are leveled, or how many lawsuits are filed, we might never know how many young gymnasts have stories similar to the one Maroney told on Wednesday. It sickens me to consider that there are probably many, many more. But now we know Maroney was one of them, and odds are she won\u2019t be the last to raise her hand to say, \u201cMe Too.\u201d\u201cThis is me being brave after 27 years,\u201d Gutsu wrote. She called Scherbo a \u201cmonster who kept me in my own prison to be afraid for so many years.\u201dIf you\u2019re taken aback by this wave of raw honesty, and surprised by the sheer numbers of \u201cMe Too\u201d posts out there, then you\u2019re probably not a woman. To so many of us, too many of us, none of this is new.Those people who remained unprotected were athletes. Young ones. Older ones. Ones who have had to carry the burden of abuse for years, their lips zipped and their hearts heavy. Ones whose parents had entrusted them to coaches, adults who were supposed to keep those children safe. Ones who attended national gymnastics team training camps at Bela and Martha Karolyi\u2019s rural Texas ranch, where Nassar often met with the gymnasts in their rooms, alone, and molested them.Some of the athletes whispered among themselves that they felt uncomfortable with Nassar\u2019s so-called techniques. But the stories stayed secrets. The gymnasts\u2019 careers were on the line.\u201cWherever there is a position of power, there seems to be potential for abuse,\u201d Maroney wrote. \u201cI had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting.\u201dThe Nassars and the Weinsteins of the world who haven\u2019t been outed yet should be worried about \u201cMe Too.\u201d Because now that women can see that they\u2019re not alone, more will speak up, because so many of them have stories to tell. Like me.There was the time when I covered Nascar in the 1990s and was cornered by a top driver in the back of his trailer while trying to conduct an interview. As the cars roared around the racetrack, he blocked the door and said he wouldn\u2019t let me leave unless I kissed him. The team\u2019s publicist saved me by knocking on the door.Or the time when another driver kept putting his hand on my leg as I sat next to him during a group interview. Or the meeting at the Olympics where a man in public relations threw himself at me, hands grabbing, as soon as he closed his office door, forcing me to talk my way out of the room.I thought all of those experiences were just par for the course for a woman in sports, and, in many ways, it turns out they were. But those moments were degrading and frustrating and isolating \u2014 after all, I just wanted to do my job, like anyone else \u2014 and so I never shared those details. I couldn\u2019t believe that I\u2019d ended up in those situations, and was embarrassed.Without the boldness of so many other women, as so many of them join hands to pull back the curtain on this problem, I still might have preferred to say nothing.That silence is exactly what abusers are counting on. They can\u2019t count on it anymore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valpolicella Comes Out of the Shadows", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesValpolicella seems to have fallen off the face of the earth.Not literally, of course. The vines are still growing there in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy, and the bottles are still being filled and shipped. Yet this once ubiquitous wine now seems kind of absent.Back in the 1970s and \u201980s, even American children knew of Valpolicella.Well, you don\u2019t see much interest in Paul Masson, either, nowadays. And come to think of it, TV commercials for wine are pretty rare, too. But the shifting marketing strategies of big brands are less interesting to me than what has become of Valpolicella.The answer is staring at anyone who happens to be looking at a high-end Italian wine list. It is Amarone, more formally known as Amarone della Valpolicella, a wine that has become wildly popular since the 1980s.Both wines originate in the same region of the Veneto, north of Verona, and are made from the same grapes: primarily corvina, with some rondinella and corvinone. Molinara and a few other grapes are also permitted in smaller quantities.The production of Amarone, as is evident by the formal name, is interwoven with Valpolicella. Traditionally, a small percentage of grapes in the region are dried after harvest until they became sweet and concentrated. They are then fermented into a sweet wine, Recioto della Valpolicella. The concentration of sugar in the dried grapes produces high alcohol levels in which yeast cannot survive \u2014 generally dying before fermentation is complete \u2014 leaving a sweet, unctuous wine.Occasionally, though, the Recioto ferments until it is dry. This is Amarone, a powerful wine with alcohol levels that can surpass 16 percent. Even though it is considered dry, it can leave a profoundly sweet impression.The powerful wake of Amarone has given rise to a new style of Valpolicella, known as Ripasso. Valpolicella itself tends to be light- to medium-bodied wine, fragrant but not opulent. The popularity of Amarone led to efforts to add muscle to Valpolicella, by employing Amarone-like techniques to its production.In order to make Ripasso, grape skins left over from Amarone production or dried grapes are added to Valpolicella. The resulting maceration adds body, tannins, alcohol and intensity to the wine.With the natural inclination to assume that more is better, it is tempting to think that Valpolicella Ripasso, with more flavor, intensity and body, is better than ordinary Valpolicella. Many people feel that way, and Ripassos can be fine wines. But I have always preferred the freshness and easy drinkability of plain old Valpolicella, which, like Beaujolais, has historically been a wine you could knock back without fear of heaviness, headache or hangover.Keeping all this in mind, the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles of Valpolicella from recent vintages. Our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch, did his best to select only ordinary Valpolicellas for the tasting, but it\u2019s not always easy to differentiate Valpolicella from Valpolicella Ripasso. The wine now has its own official designation, Ripasso della Valpolicella, but it is not always used.For our part, we all thought Bernie did pretty well in his selections. Of the 20 bottles, only one stood out as not a classic Valpolicella. This bottle, the 2012 Bussola Classico Superiore TB, was syrupy and 15.5 percent alcohol, and against the others, which ranged from 11.5 to 13.5 percent, it was more Amarone than Ripasso. Otherwise, we were impressed. As the production of these ordinary Valpolicellas has declined, the quality has risen.\u201cThat\u2019s a wine that takes me to that place,\u201d Justin said, speaking of the Veneto region. \u201cI appreciated their freshness and energy.\u201dSome of the wines seemed modern and highly polished, which made them less distinctive. But the best were quintessential Italian reds, balancing the flavors of sweet cherry fruit with a tart, earthy quality and a welcome bitterness that refreshed. These wines seemed light, almost delicate, yet they had a linear intensity, offering a progression of evolving sensations from first taste through last impression that lingered well after swallowing.Those that we did not like so well seemed tarted up, not with the flavors of new oak barrels \u2014 as is so often the case in historic wine regions \u2014 but with richness, Ripasso-style, that thickened the texture. The lightness and linearity were lost. The richness seemed shapeless, arriving but not progressing.The Ca\u2019 Rugate was a simple Valpolicella rather than a Valpolicella Classico, a geographical indication. The Classicos come from the heart of the historic Valpolicella region, which is generally considered to have better potential than simple Valpolicella, which usually comes from areas into which the appellation expanded in the mid-20th century. That may be so, but five of our top 10 were simple Valpolicellas, which suggests that conscientious farming and careful production may currently be more important than location.The Valpolicella consortium acknowledges that Ripasso is the driving force in sales from this region of the Veneto. But trade association officials say they are taking steps to preserve what they call ordinary Valpolicella. By 2018, producers will be limited to making twice as much Ripasso as they make Amarone, and they will only be able to use Valpolicella Superiore wines. This, they hope, will ensure that some grapes are left over for Valpolicella as it has always been.BEST VALUEDeep, long, complex and savory, with flavors of tart cherry and earth.

It wasn\u2019t quite the Paramount lot, but neither did it look like a space for some digital start-up intent on creating viral videos on the cheap.\u201cIt\u2019s a much better place, especially for my team,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cIt feels a little bit more like a grown-up office, for lack of a better term.\u201dThese days Mr. Henick and his team of 42 people concentrate their energies on mining BuzzFeed articles, lists and video shorts for ideas that may be spun into feature-length movies or television series.\u201cI\u2019ll have to go out there for a good chunk of time if the movie gets made, which may not time well with the baby,\u201d Mr. Henick said.Mr. Henick grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., and spent his childhood riding forklifts around his father\u2019s floor-covering business at a warehouse in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg neighborhood that has since been converted into an apartment building. His interest in media and technology began early.When he was 14, he and his best friend created an MP3 website that drew a cease-and-desist letter from the Recording Industry Association of America because it hosted the \u201cTitanic\u201d soundtrack.Several years later, Mr. Henick and his friend started one of the first ringtone sites in the United States. They bought the domain name NokiaUSA.net in the hope that Nokia customers would stumble on their site. Nokia was not pleased \u2014 it served the teenagers a cease-and-desist letter in the halls of their high school, after which they changed the company\u2019s name to MobileSmarts. The business, Mr. Henick said, made a lot of money, although he wouldn\u2019t specify how much.\u201cHe\u2019s an entrepreneur who knows how to build new things and new companies,\u201d Jonah Peretti, the founder and chief executive of BuzzFeed, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m always amazed at the way he\u2019s able to switch between these different models in his head and see the same things through a totally different lens.\u201dMr. Henick\u2019s experience as a teenage ringtone magnate gave him the idea to go west for college. \u201cI was sort of already on that trajectory of wanting to head at least somewhere close to Silicon Valley, to figure out what was going on there,\u201d he said.\u201cThe professor would want to talk to us about LiveJournal and Myspace to a certain extent, and the students in the class would raise their hand and say, \u2018Well, what do you think about Facebook?\u2019\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t even know about it.\u201dFrom there, Mr. Henick studied producing at the University of Southern California\u2019s film school in Los Angeles. During summer break, he attended a talk at the Skirball Cultural Center by the comedy producer Judd Apatow.\u201cI just went up to him and told him as much of my story as I could,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cWe were both from Long Island, both went to U.S.C., and I was looking for a gig.\u201dMr. Apatow brought him on as an intern before hiring him as an assistant, so Mr. Henick spent his second year at U.S.C. balancing classes with reading scripts and checking out sets. After graduation, he worked on movies like \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d and \u201cStep Brothers\u201d before going out on his own as a writer, script doctor and start-up consultant.Along the way, he and Ms. Killoch, who met at U.S.C., started a clothing company. They also got married.\u201cI clearly get bored very easily, because I do too many things,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cI was literally sitting in my apartment writing movies, doing all right \u2014 that\u2019s sort of the dream for some people \u2014 and I was like, \u2018What else can I be doing?\u2019\u201dBefore Mr. Henick started at BuzzFeed, he was worried that he might end up restless yet again. But so far, he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been bored once.\u201dDuring Mr. Henick\u2019s tenure, many digital media companies that once raked in millions of investment dollars found themselves struggling. A so-called pivot to video \u2014 a term sometimes used to cover layoffs of text-oriented staff members \u2014 swept the industry. Increasingly wary of the outsize influence of Facebook and Google \u2014 and hoping to siphon away some of the billions of advertising dollars still devoted to television \u2014 new media companies rediscovered old media, setting off a race into TV and film.Cue Mr. Henick.His mission is to help diversify BuzzFeed\u2019s revenue stream: Executives expect that partnerships with production studios may bring in a third of the company\u2019s revenue in the coming years.\u201cI don\u2019t think we do anything specifically for that reason, but it\u2019s always a byproduct,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cIf our business is stronger and it\u2019s growing exponentially because we keep finding brand-new businesses to get into, it\u2019s going to allow us to hopefully go public or invest in a lot more stuff elsewhere in the company.\u201dDuring a weekly check-in meeting at the old BuzzFeed lot on Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Henick swiveled around on his desk chair, a hand under his chin. He wore jeans, a light blue button-down and retro Air Jordan sneakers. Staff members talked about projects or possible deals with Netflix, MTV and Facebook.Mr. Henick\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cI would retire out on top,\u201d he said, \u201cif we could get Sorkin to write it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

More on that in a moment.This morning, we\u2019re announcing the speaker lineup for our sixth annual conference.Andrew will host a series of conversations throughout the day with some of the biggest newsmakers at the intersection of business and policy.Among them:A rare public interview with one of the most influential women in the worlds of business and philanthropy, whose organization invests in businesses like The Atlantic and the Washington Wizards and in causes like immigration and education.Also: Will the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback be able to prove that the N.F.L.\u2019s owners have banded together to prevent him from playing?From the filing:Respondents N.F.L. and N.F.L.

Under the [collective bargaining agreement], the mere fact that a player is unsigned does not constitute evidence of collusion.Why this matters\u2022 Mr. Kapernick\u2019s protest during the national anthem set off President Trump\u2019s attacks against the league, pitting players against owners and drawing sponsors into the fray.\u2022 If N.F.L. owners had hoped for a swift end to the controversy, they\u2019re probably disappointed.The answer:And Steve Bannon went on record to say that the White House move was meant to destroy the Obama health care plan.Bannon said Trump\u2019s decision to not continue funding Obamacare subsidies, announced Thursday, was designed to \u201cblow up\u201d the health care law and insurance marketplaces.\u201cGonna blow those exchanges up, right?\u201d Bannon said.Terminating this critical program will do just the opposite.

{"Headline": "The Progressive Voice Bursting From Texas and Spreading Everywhere", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesWAXAHACHIE, Tex. \u2014 You probably know Dale Hansen. Even if the name doesn\u2019t ring a bell, you have surely seen his work by now.Hansen, a white-haired grandfather who hasn\u2019t voted since 1972, has become an unlikely viral video star at age 69. You probably have noticed him scroll by as you traverse the Facebook feeds and Twitter timelines and pop culture websites that now serve as America\u2019s secondary news source. All of them have helped to disseminate the folksy commentaries Hansen delivers on WFAA in Dallas, the ABC affiliate that has employed him for more than 30 years, to a much, much wider audience.Over the past five or six years, Hansen\u2019s words have regularly traveled far and wide \u2014 probably farther than you know. When I showed up last week at his house here, about 30 miles south of Dallas, he was finishing an interview with a radio station in New Zealand.\u201cI guess they liked what I had to say,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cNot bad for a guy who was fired from nine of his 11 jobs in television.\u201dHansen\u2019s latest commentary \u2014 in which he presented his Texas audience with a heartfelt defense of black Americans\u2019 protests and an indictment of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d \u2014 was just the latest in a recurring segment, called \u201cHansen: Unplugged,\u201d that has run on WFAA for years. He says he writes the segments in about 10 minutes and delivers them in about three, but only, he said, when he feels strongly that he has something to say. For Hansen, that\u2019s about eight to 10 times a year.His talks are topical. Nearly all are personal. In previous ones, he has revealed racism in his hometown, his daughter\u2019s long-ago rape as a college student, and even his own experience as a 10-year-old victim of sexual abuse.\u201cYou beat a woman and drag her down a flight of stairs, pulling her hair out by the roots? You\u2019re the fourth guy taken in the draft,\u201d he said. Caught with drugs? Kill someone driving drunk? Rape a woman? People are O.K. with that, he said.\u201cYou love another man?\u201d Hansen said. \u201cWell, now you\u2019ve gone too far!\u201dThe riffs have made Hansen something of an outlier: a local newsman with a national voice, a champion for social issues in a stick-to-sports world, a liberal voice in a deeply red state that\u2019s as passionate about its sports as it is its politics.Here in Texas, mixing those two religions is nearly a sin, but the cocky Hansen revels in taking on sacred cows, saying, \u201cOh, well, I\u2019m agnostic anyway.\u201dThe truth is he realizes that he is in the perfect position, at the perfect time in his life, to say what he believes.\u201cIf I was 33 years old and looked like Tom Cruise and lived in Los Angeles, do you think anyone would listen to me?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t really explain why people listen to me. But I do know some people are thinking, Who is this fat, old, white sports guy and why is he telling me what to do? I don\u2019t fit the stereotype.\u201dIn other ways, though, he\u2019s a typical Texan. He lives with his wife, Chris, on a 39-acre ranch that also is home to three Longhorns, six dogs, two horses, two mini horses and one mini donkey named Edward R. Burro. He has a home office stuffed with awards honoring his journalism and photos documenting his career.Many days, before he drives to Dallas to tape the 6 and 10 p.m. news, he often plays cards with a group of buddies at a local golf club, gambling maybe a couple hundred bucks and chatting about the world. It is at those tables, he knows, where he hones the arguments that he later presents on TV.\u201cI\u2019ll say something that gets them mad and they\u2019ll say, \u2018You\u2019re nothing but a goddamn liberal,\u2019\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAnd I laugh and say, \u2018Gee, I thought you\u2019d say something really bad.\u2019\u201dGrowing up in Iowa, Hansen said, he never would have dreamed he would be the orator he has become, or have the perspective that he shares so freely now. His father, a trucker who owned his own company, thought all black people \u2014 except the one black family he knew personally \u2014 were basically worthless. Hansen said he \u201cheard the N-word\u201d every day as a kid, so much so, he said, that he thought it was Hank Aaron\u2019s first name.It makes sense, then, when Hansen tells you he once wrote an English paper titled, \u201cLet\u2019s face the facts: Negroes are just plain troublemakers.\u201d But he says it is those same life experiences that explain his political and cultural evolution.\u201cI\u2019m attracted to diversity because I had none in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI like people who challenge me, who aren\u2019t the same as me.\u201dThat may be why Hansen, a Texas institution, has resonated nationally. Agree with Hansen or not, it\u2019s good for all of us that he is allowed to have his say. Sure, Hansen is aware that some viewers tune in just to get angry with him. But he says his goal is not merely to stake out contrarian turf, or to poke at those who might disagree with him.Like the N.F.L. players he talked about last week, he said, he is trying to spur a discussion, to make people think, to challenge what they believe. That can be emotional sometimes. It certainly is for Hansen.Hansen has been around long enough, and has seen enough, to know that.Lucky for us, he\u2019s happy to tell everyone about it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Price of Reporting Is a Car Bomb", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe car bomb that killed the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia on Monday did not go off in Honduras, Afghanistan or any other country where one might expect to hear about brutal violence against reporters. The device exploded in the early afternoon down the road from her home in the tiny European nation of Malta, where, for the greater part of the last decade, the 53-year-old had held some of the most powerful people in the country accountable for political corruption, offshore financial dealings and abuse of power.It\u2019s still unclear who was behind her death, which Maltese politicians from all parties widely denounced as a murder. It\u2019s also baffling as to why the local police were not keeping a closer eye on her, given that she\u2019d apparently reported threats just two weeks before.What\u2019s certain, though, is that in addition to erasing a life, a wife, a mother of three and a small country\u2019s most popular blogger, the bomb dispensed with the idea that journalists working in developed European democracies are immune to \u2014 or even protected from \u2014 fatal repercussions for their work.Of course, physical threats and murders remain rare: A majority of damage to journalists comes in the form of censorship, financial pressure and lawsuits. But the assassination of Ms. Caruana Galizia in a developed European country illustrates how high the stakes are for journalists pushing back against power, particularly for independent reporters without institutional backing.Ms. Caruana Galizia did not work in a traditional newsroom. She\u2019d previously served as an editor for local publications and wrote regular columns for The Malta Independent, but she took to blogging prolifically, probably because she had so much more to say than a biweekly slot would allow. I exchanged emails and phone calls with her in 2014 while I was reporting on Malta\u2019s controversial plans to sell its citizenship to wealthy foreigners. Her site was an invaluable source of information, and she was a helpful sounding board.Matthew Caruana Galizia, Daphne\u2019s son and a reporter and programmer for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, found his mother\u2019s remains in and around the burning vehicle. Later on Monday, he posted on Facebook: \u201cMy mother was assassinated because she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it, like many strong journalists. But she was also targeted because she was the only person doing so. This is what happens when the institutions of the state are incapacitated: The last person left standing is often a journalist. Which makes her the first person left dead.\u201dOver the past two years, her name came up most frequently in the context of the Panama Papers, an enormous leak of offshore bank account data obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Ms. Caruana Galizia was not part of the reporting team, and didn\u2019t have access to the papers themselves. She did, however, smell a rat long before a whistle-blower confirmed its presence \u2014 and when the leaks showed that some of Mr. Muscat\u2019s associates had set up bank accounts in Panama, she relied on her own knowledge, sources and intuition to obtain information leading her to allege on her blog that Mr. Muscat\u2019s wife, Michelle, owned one of these firms. (Maltese officials still deny this.)\u201cDaphne was on the case of the ministers and their offshore holdings before the leaks came out,\u201d recalls Marina Walker, the deputy director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. \u201cShe preceded and enriched the Panama Papers \u2014 and she worked alone, which is the hardest thing to do.\u201dMs. Caruana Galizia\u2019s revelations were instrumental in pushing Mr. Muscat to call a snap election in June, which he won in spite of the corruption allegations. Still, she didn\u2019t back down; she kept criticizing Mr. Muscat, and his political rivals, too.\u201cShe was fearless and feared,\u201d Jason Azzopardi, an outspoken member of the opposition party, told me over the phone. \u201cThe aim of people who carried out\u201d the murder \u201cwas not \u2018merely\u2019 to eliminate her physically but to intimidate, shock and awe.\u201dThe impact of the bomb that killed Ms. Caruana Galizia isn\u2019t just being felt in her country. Reporters around the world are asking themselves: If it can happen in Malta, can it happen anywhere?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Old Beer Learns New Tricks, and Risks an Identity Crisis", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 PhotosHis drinking companion, Glen Bootay, 52, of Elizabethtown, Pa., sipped a Leinenkugel\u2019s Summer Shandy, a tawny wheat beer laced with lemonade flavoring and sucrose syrup.Mr. Long puckered his face at his buddy\u2019s sweetened brew, then conceded that any fan of Leinie\u2019s, as Wisconsinites know the beer, was a member of a tribe.\u201cIt\u2019s a cult thing,\u201d he said, raising his plastic cup.But with success has come the kind of identity crisis that faces many midsize regional brewers as they jostle for market share with ascendant microbreweries and shelf-hogging megabrands: How to expand their appeal without losing their patina of authenticity?Leinenkugel\u2019s, now known around the country for its fruity shandies, owes its home-turf reputation to a slate of unfussy heritage lagers that Wisconsinites have long enjoyed at corner taverns and fish fries. When the Miller Brewing Company bought the brewery in 1988, some 90 percent of its production was dedicated to its flagship beer, known today as Leinenkugel\u2019s Original (\u201cLeinie\u2019s O\u201d to the faithful), a crisp German lager brewed from the 1867 recipe of its patriarch, Jacob Leinenkugel.The buyout initially ruffled feathers here, but the Milwaukee-based Miller won over all but the most purist drinkers by keeping production in this small town and retaining the Leinenkugel family to manage the brand \u2014 an unusual approach at the time. Now headed by Dick Leinenkugel, the founder\u2019s great-great-grandson, the brewery still enjoys a reputation around Wisconsin as a scrappy family enterprise, even though some of the beer is brewed in Milwaukee.Miller\u2019s early efforts to sell Leinie\u2019s O on the East and West Coasts fizzled. So the company embraced variety as a means of wooing new drinkers in the Upper Midwest, devoting more and more effort to a motley parade of new labels, limited releases and seasonal brews.Today, many breweries have embraced a similar model of quasi-independent corporate partnership and persistent novelty.Summer Shandy is Leinenkugel\u2019s first national success. The style is a take on a radler, a traditional German mixture of beer and citrus juice or soda, originally created to sate thirsty cyclists. (Radler is German for cyclist.) While some craft beers incorporate fruit into the brewing process, Leinenkugel\u2019s shandies are the products of extracts and sweeteners added to a finished brew.Encouraged by regional demand, MillerCoors pushed Summer Shandy nationally in 2010 as a summer seasonal release. By the summer of 2012, according to data from IRI, a Chicago market research firm, it was outselling all but three craft competitors in supermarkets.A dozen new Leinenkugel\u2019s shandy varieties followed (as did copycat shandy brands), and the line now accounts for nearly 70 percent of the brewer\u2019s production. Leinenkugel\u2019s is now the country\u2019s fifth-best-selling craft beer brand, according to IRI.But for some longtime drinkers, including many among the 11,000 who gathered in Chippewa Falls for the anniversary party, watching trendy shandies eclipse the workingman\u2019s beers their grandparents once enjoyed is disorienting. During a question-and-answer session with the company\u2019s brewmasters, one wistful Leinie\u2019s drinker shouted, \u201cWhen are you going to brew some beer that tastes like beer?\u201dAndy McGrane, a 47-year-old Chippewa Falls resident dressed for the weekend in lederhosen, described the shandy drinkers and fans of his favorite style, Leinenkugel\u2019s Red Lager, as \u201ctotally different groups.\u201d\u201cI had no idea what was going on with Summer Shandy in these other states until friends from Tampa told me it was their favorite,\u201d he said.That schism weighs on the mind of C.J. Leinenkugel, 34, an account executive in the Pacific Northwest who, with his three siblings and a cousin, is among the sixth generation to work for his family\u2019s brewery.\u201cWe\u2019re the shandy people to some folks now,\u201d he said, after posing for a family photo with about 90 members of the Leinenkugel clan. \u201cIt does, in a sense, kind of bum you out because we do brew so many other beers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe beer that put a roof over my head was Leinie\u2019s O.\u201dIn August, MillerCoors released Leinenkugel\u2019s Original nationwide for the first time, part of a fall sampler pack of Leinie\u2019s classic brews. Dick Leinenkugel hopes to more than double total production to two million barrels by 2020. And with light-bodied German beers enjoying a resurgence, he sees an opportunity to attract new drinkers to the clean, malty lagers beloved in Wisconsin \u2014 particularly the 35 percent of shandy drinkers who, company research suggests, didn\u2019t previously drink beer.All the same, he\u2019s glad he can finally buy Leinie\u2019s old brew far from his home state.\u201cIt\u2019s like cheese curds or the Packers,\u201d Mr. Schmiege said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s nostalgic, it\u2019s Wisconsin. Even though it\u2019s bigger than that now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Indonesia, a Mosque and a Church Foster Friendship Amid Religious Tensions", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJakarta JournalJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 On a tree-lined side street in the Indonesian capital sits a colonial-era Protestant church with rustic wooden pews and stained-glass windows, and an antique pipe organ built into a large wall behind the altar.Across the street is a modern, 100,000-square-foot mosque with towering arches at its entrances and a cavernous prayer area laid wall-to-wall with red carpet.Despite their different faiths, the two houses of worship are friendly, helpful neighbors \u2014 and an example of pluralism in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation at a time of heightened fears over religious intolerance.\u201cWe respect each other,\u201d said Nur Alam, an imam at the Sunda Kelapa Grand Mosque, which opened in 1971. \u201cIf we never offend other people, then we will be respected.\u201dAcross the street, Adriaan Pitoy is a pastor at St. Paul\u2019s Church, which was built in 1936 under the Dutch colonial administration. \u201cOur relationship is just one of many steps we take,\u201d he said of the neighbors at the mosque. \u201cWe also go to other mosques to promote dialogue. Our relationship with our friends next door is normal.\u201dFor the two houses of worship, normal means sharing parking spaces during busier services: Friday Prayer for the mosque, Sunday service for the church. They also host interfaith dialogue sessions, and even volleyball tournaments. During Ramadan, the Muslim holy fasting month, the staff at St. Paul\u2019s, some of whom are Muslim, carry boxes of food to the mosque for worshipers there to break their fast.This type of religious harmony among neighboring houses of worship is evident not just in Jakarta, but across the Indonesian archipelago. About 90 percent of Indonesia\u2019s 260 million people are identified as Muslim, but the country also has small but influential Christian, Hindu, Buddhist and Confucian populations.Yet these friendly relations are regularly overshadowed by international news reports and social media posts about racial intolerance and fears of the \u201cIslamization\u201d of Indonesia.\u201cIf you see the actions of these hard-line groups, and threats from ISIS, or Indonesian militants coming back from Syria, they are a threat to interfaith cooperation in Indonesia,\u201d said Theophilus Bela, former president of the Jakarta Christian Communication Forum, who has for years documented attacks on, and discriminatory actions against, churches in Indonesia.A recent local challenge to religious harmony can be found cater-cornered from St. Paul\u2019s Church and the Sunda Kelapa Grand Mosque, where, across a boulevard and public park, lies the official residence of the governor of Jakarta.Mr. Basuki\u2019s prosecution and imprisonment shocked much of the country, in particular its religious minority communities.Despite the case and its stoking of Muslim-Christian tensions, both Mr. Nur and Mr. Pitoy contend that the episode of Mr. Basuki was more political than religious, and they say they are not worried about the long-term durability of Indonesia\u2019s pluralistic tradition.\u201cThe people of Indonesia know that there have been conflicts among religious groups, but actually it\u2019s not really just because of religious faith, but maybe it\u2019s political, economic and things like that,\u201d Mr. Pitoy said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s difficult to differentiate between politics and religion \u2014 especially in Indonesia.\u201dIn August, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a human rights organization founded in Britain, released a report saying that Indonesia\u2019s centuries-old tradition of religious pluralism was \u201cunder severe threat,\u201d and that its reputation as a moderate, democratic Muslim-majority nation that protects freedom of religion was being undermined.The report said some Christian communities particularly feared for their safety.\u201cThere\u2019s almost a sense that they are second-class citizens in their own country,\u201d said Benedict Rogers, the organization\u2019s East Asia team leader.In response to the fall of Mr. Basuki, who used to attend St. Paul\u2019s, Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko Widodo, one of his key political allies, established a special task force to reinforce the country\u2019s state ideology, known as Pancasila, which enshrines pluralism.Despite Mr. Basuki\u2019s case, violent attacks on religious minorities have decreased substantially in the past five years. The Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace, a nongovernmental organization in Jakarta, had recorded only 93 such attacks this year through August, compared with 264 in all of 2012.\u201cBut the number of blasphemy cases because of social media, because people have comments on Facebook and groups report them to the police, that is growing now,\u201d said Bonar Tigor Naipospos, vice chairman of the Setara Institute\u2019s executive board.Mr. Nur and Mr. Pitoy both said Indonesia\u2019s core problem with religion is not intolerance, but a lack of education and understanding among its people. Less than half of all Indonesians have completed primary school, according to the government\u2019s statistical bureau.\u201cIndonesia is Muslim-majority \u2014 you have to accept it \u2014 but the lower class has a very simple knowledge\u201d of Islam, Mr. Nur said. \u201cThat is why, if you want to know about the essence of Islam, which is peace and tolerance, study the Quran.\u201dWhen asked if he thought that religious intolerance was growing in Indonesia, Mr. Pitoy, the pastor at St. Paul\u2019s, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cThe problems are about poverty and making social justice a reality,\u201d he said of the challenges facing the church. \u201cAlso, with globalization, there are failures internally, and it has created many sudden changes. It\u2019s very important to have a common foundation, and we have it with our Constitution and Pancasila.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the type of gathering held at St. Paul\u2019s Church in Jakarta. It is a service, not a Mass.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation \u2014 specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, \u201csweeteners\u201d or pork barrel spending.Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the law\u2019s passage.The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign. But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospital\u2019s location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area. Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments. Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because they\u2019re separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.How did hospitals spend the extra money? Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients \u2014 about 8 percent more per year. They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies. But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital. Over all, \u201chigh 508 recipient hospitals\u201d had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 \u2014 about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have. There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.\u201cIf you told me in advance that we\u2019d find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cWe knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.\u201dSection 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years. But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically. In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.\u201cEvery time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that any single one is hugely offensive. It\u2019s their accumulation and continuation over time.\u201dAlthough Mr. Cooper\u2019s research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new \u2014 and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.None of this is surprising. A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected. Passing expansive legislation \u2014 like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A. \u2014 is hard, especially when legislators can\u2019t point to specific benefits for their constituents. But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.\u201cYou can\u2019t get upset at a snake for having fangs,\u201d Mr. Cooper told me. \u201cWe need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives. We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that we\u2019ve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed. The same argument holds for health care. When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, it\u2019s too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.\u201dAmerica\u2019s increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like. But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too \u2014 without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits \u2014 if any \u2014 go to a favored few. Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system. Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian Lawmakers Say Pro-Russia Group Tried to Derail Sanctions Law", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Canadian lawmakers took up legislation on Wednesday that would bar businesses from dealing with foreigners who have committed human rights abuses, a nonprofit group called the Russian Congress of Canada pushed hard against the measure.The pro-Russia group denies any connection to the Kremlin, but lawmakers say the push fits a pattern of Moscow-backed interference in the West. And they say that the lobbying campaign, which began in 2014 and grew with attacks last spring on Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, highlights the dangers of Russian meddling in Canada.Nonetheless, the bill passed unanimously in Parliament on Wednesday evening. It allows Canada to sanction, freeze assets or deny entry to foreigners from any country that has violated human rights or engaged in corruption.\u201cEverybody realizes that some organizations are being used as a proxy for Putin,\u201d James Bezan, a conservative member of Parliament and a supporter of the bill said. \u201cThese groups are trying to disrupt and discredit this legislation in Canada and democracy within our own borders.\u201dIn an interview, John McKay, a Liberal member of Parliament, dismissed the group as a front for the Russian Embassy in Ottawa and cited its lobbying activities in his concerns over interference by the Russian government in Canadian affairs. \u201cWe are concerned about the business of fake news and misinformation,\u201d he said.He said his suspicions of coordination between the Russian government and the group deepened after a speech he gave on the issue in Parliament on Monday, when he received an email from the Russian Embassy spokesman, Kirill Kalanin, that included articles making similar pro-Russian arguments mentioned in a letter from the group.\u201cTheir tactics are so amateurish they\u2019re not even subtle,\u201d Mr. McKay said. \u201cIt\u2019s so stupid that the dullest among us can see through that.\u201dThe president of the group, Igor Babalich, said in an interview that his group did not coordinate with the Russian Embassy or take orders from Moscow.\u201cWe are a completely independent nonprofit organization,\u201d said Mr. Babalich, who worked for a decade, until December 2016, as a software engineer at The Globe and Mail, the Toronto newspaper.He added that the group was founded on behalf of Russian-speaking Canadians who are \u201ctired of the increase in anti-Russian information campaigns.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have any connection to the embassy,\u201d he said.Officials at the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. On its website the embassy posted a statement calling the bill \u201ca deplorably confrontational act blatantly interfering into Russia\u2019s domestic affairs.\u201d The statement added, \u201cThis hostile move, as well as any new anti-Russian sanctions, will be met with resolve and reciprocal countermeasures.\u201dOf the group, he added, \u201cTo call it a grass-roots organization that represents the Russian community in Canada is pure nonsense.\u201dSince it was founded in 2014, the Russian Congress of Canada and its members, including a priest at a Russian Orthodox church in Toronto, have promoted political views strongly aligned with the interests of Mr. Putin.In addition to organizing rallies and parades in Canada celebrating the anniversary of Germany\u2019s surrender to the Soviet Union in World War II, the group has written scores of letters to Canadian politicians and articles that lobbied against Canada\u2019s involvement in NATO; condemned Ottawa\u2019s criticism of the Russian invasion of Ukraine; and questioned the integrity of Ms. Freeland by citing claims that her Ukrainian grandfather was a Nazi collaborator.Those claims were first reported on pro-Kremlin websites and spread after she was appointed minister of foreign affairs in January.In June, the organization sent letters to members of Parliament calling for Canada to withdraw its support of the Magnitsky legislation. Claiming to be representatives of the Russian diaspora in Canada, the group said the bill would harm Canada\u2019s interests, while accusing its supporters of anti-Russian bias.In discussing accusations that Mr. Magnitsky was beaten in prison, the letter suggested that deaths in Canadian prisons could be used as a basis for sanctions against Canadian officials by other governments.Adam Austen, the press secretary for the foreign affairs minister, said the new Canadian law would enable Canada to hold foreigners accountable for human rights violations and corruption. He added that the government was aware of the risks posed by foreign meddling in Western affairs.\u201cWe are of course preoccupied by this threat and are committed to protecting the integrity of our democracy here at home,\u201d he said.The Magnitsky law and efforts to expand it globally have enraged the Russian president.But to critics of Mr. Putin, Mr. Magnitsky, in death, has become a symbol of corruption and brutality in the Russian state.On Facebook, Ms. Veselnitskaya denounced all iterations of the law, including the Canadian legislation.Reached by email on Wednesday, Ms. Veselnitskaya said she had no connection to lobbying against the Canadian bill. \u201cI did not participate,\u201d she said.The meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times, is now a focus of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the American election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art of Destroying an Artwork", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe decision came after intense protests, but it also set off its own debate. Critics called it censorship, and worried that advocacy groups \u2014 in this case, animal rights organizations \u2014 now had veto power over art and its public display.But there\u2019s a problem with this binary formulation, which opposes the sacrosanct art object to the interests and demands of the public. Curators need to think about more creative ways to withdraw art from public display. Rather than thinking of calls to remove art as either right or wrong, institutions should think of them as creative opportunities to reimagine who their public is.But in some ways, even though the two institutions\u2019 responses were different, they also had more in common than you\u2019d think. The Guggenheim acquiesced, positioning itself along the way as a victim of censorship; the Whitney refused, and sought to soften this refusal with programs and texts. In both cases, the museums reinforced a debate about an artwork that only makes room for one question: Should it stay or should it go?What we should be asking, instead, is how it should \u201cgo.\u201d A work of art could be destroyed (burned, buried, shredded), edited, documented, mourned or even substituted. It could be supplemented with performances, talks, protests. It could be turned into minimalist furniture for the museum cafe, or sold on eBay, with the proceeds going to charity.Contemporary art theory has long held that the artwork takes place not in the moment of creation or exhibition, but rather in the ways that it circulates in the world. That\u2019s why withdrawal isn\u2019t just a negative act. The museum is actively putting the withdrawal into the world, which will then circulate beside and on top of the artwork, as a rumor, a footnote, a filter. I am arguing for a creative acceptance of the pressure to withdraw an artwork, rather than either outright rejection or reluctant acquiescence.For a different example, look to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. In the spring the museum erected an outdoor sculpture by the artist Sam Durant that replicated the gallows where 38 Dakota people were executed in 1862.Was that \u201ccensorship\u201d? The work was removed, but in a creative way that arguably added more meaning to the work than it ever would have had it remained standing.In some ways, the emptying out of \u201cTheater of the World\u201d also made it more meaningful. Huang Yong Ping, the Paris-based Chinese provocateur behind that work, has frequently been censored. His work \u201cBat Project II,\u201d a reproduction of part of an American spy plane that crashed into a Chinese fighter, was withdrawn from the 2002 Guangzhou Triennial. The depression that the artwork left in the ground remained, however, as a haunting trace of the original work. Whether intentional or not, this sort of lasting reminder of a work should be an inspiration for how museums can handle controversial works: removal, but not erasure.For another example, look to how artists responded to the Whitney Biennial. Parker Bright occupied the space in front of the Till painting on several days with text written across his shirt: \u201cNo lynch mob\u201d and \u201cBlack death spectacle.\u201d His intervention confronted viewers with the reality of a physical body, not just an abstraction of one.A banner that Pastiche Lumumba hung from the High Line, which runs alongside the Whitney, drew attention to the way that history is not yet past: \u201cThe white woman whose lies got Emmett Till lynched is still alive in 2017. Feel old yet?\u201d For observers like myself, this performance was more compelling than the original painting.Social media has changed how we communicate, and social inequity continues to differentiate how we feel. These dynamics are changing the way we curate. For one thing, the work of exhibition-making no longer ends when the show opens. Instead, it continues as a process of listening, a public performance that goes on for months.The \u201cshould it stay or should it go\u201d approach fumbles the opportunity to broaden and enrich what that \u201cus\u201d is. It\u2019s a difficult question, and we will not agree, but even asking it together creates a kind of community. It falls to curators to facilitate this conversation. Institutions, following the lead of artists, should respond creatively to the call for censorship. Perhaps the withdrawal of the artwork can make room for something else to come into view: a new public.David Xu Borgonjon is a curator and writer.Advertisement"}

It would be called Hack Temple.\u201cWe had so many concerns from our investors saying this would be inappropriate and we should change it,\u201d said Mr. Cherkashin, 44, who planned to officially open Hack Temple this fall. \u201cA bunch of Russian guys opening a hacker temple in the middle of San Francisco at a time when Russian hackers are considered the most evil in the world. They say you can\u2019t.\u201dAt the same time, many said that as Russia gained a reputation for its hackers, interest in hiring its tech talent was increasing.Now when Mr. Cherkashin, a partner at GVA Capital, which is investing $120 million in start-ups, pitches companies on why they should take investments from him, he gets skeptical questions as soon as they hear his accent, he said.\u201cIt feels like if you\u2019re a politician and you fell into a sex scandal, and everybody knows you for this, and every time someone recognizes you they have this smile on their face, \u2018So how\u2019s your personal life doing?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Cherkashin, whose firm was incorporated in the United States.\u201cThis is how I feel every time I meet with an investor and they hear my Russian accent,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have this smile on their face.\u201dProspective partners and start-ups invariably ask the same question, Mr. Cherkashin said: Is his money clean?\u201cThis question comes up two or three times a day,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people would ask this question to a manager from another region.\u201dJulian Zegelman, an entrepreneur and a lawyer who represents and invests in Russian-speaking founders, said potential local tech partners worried they would accidentally get into business with the Russian government.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be invested or dealing with companies whose technical talent is captive in Russia,\u201d he said.Mr. Zegelman said he had noticed that some cybersecurity firms, big tech companies, government customers and large venture capital firms were the most wary about working with new Russian immigrants. Yet some start-ups and small investment firms are more interested in Russian talent now.\u201cIf you would have asked 10 years ago what Russia was known for, it would be Putin, the oligarchs and oil,\u201d he said, referring to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cNow when you ask folks, \u2018What do you think about Russia?\u2019 you get things back like: \u2018Oh, great cryptography.\u2019 \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a lot of talented engineers.\u2019\u201dLeonard Grayver, a lawyer specializing in start-ups who is on the board of the American Business Association of Russian-Speaking Professionals, said the hacking had put Russian tech talent at \u201cthe forefront.\u201d His firm brokers technology deals between Russia and Silicon Valley, handling tech licensing and talent acquisitions, and he said the average size of a deal had risen to $4 million this year, from $1 million to $2 million last year.And as companies staff up with Russian talent, he is getting a new question that he finds bizarre: \u201cAre we letting the wolf in the henhouse? \u201d Some companies have asked him to help arrange for heightened internal security, he added.\u201cA lot of clients are trying to find ways to hire those Russian hackers and at the same time instituting heightened security protocols internally,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re isolating source code so you don\u2019t have access to the main tree.\u201dWhen young Russian technologists first arrive in San Francisco, the person they often text is the investor Nicholas Davidov. Mr. Davidov, 30, said he was part of what he called the New Wave, which is a group of Russian founders and engineers who came over to Silicon Valley in the last few years. They gather at a Russian immigrant-owned bar in San Francisco, Rum & Sugar, and every Wednesday at a smoke shop in Redwood City, Calif., where they share stories.Most of the comments that Mr. Davidov and his friends now get are couched as jokes, he said.\u201cSomebody announced me on one of the conferences where I was speaking and said, \u2018I invited Nick because I wanted to collude with Russians,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cJust a lot of jokes.\u201dMr. Davidov is an investor in Wallarm, a cybersecurity firm based in San Francisco. He attributes Wallarm\u2019s double-digit growth this year directly to the peculiar reputation that has come from the election-influence campaign and the fact that the company\u2019s founders are Russian.Ivan Novikov, 29, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wallarm, was less enthusiastic about how news of Russian interference in the election has affected his life.\u201cTechnically, any Russian who works in I.T. is a hacker, so we\u2019re all \u2018Russian hackers,\u2019 and a lot of people like to mention it, but it\u2019s not so funny when it\u2019s 10 times per day or 10 times per party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t like this hype about it.\u201dSome Russian-born entrepreneurs said they had noticed no change in how they were treated. Stanislav Shalunov, a co-founder of Open Garden, which develops peer-to-peer mesh networking software, said he hadn\u2019t experienced anything different.\u201cWith all this hacking news, I don\u2019t think anyone alleges anyone from the Russian tech community in the U.S. is engaged in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty obvious that lots of people from Russia are getting hired.\u201dBack at what may only briefly be known as the Hack Temple (investors want a new name before it officially opens), two young Russian entrepreneurs made breakfast sandwiches in the rectory kitchen one morning last week. The building has eight bedrooms, some with bunks to fit up to four; a living room full of Midcentury Modern sofas; and a patio covered in artificial turf and often used for beer pong. Before Mr. Cherkashin bought the building in January 2016, it was Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe Church.In the cavernous nave, the stained-glass saints were covered in gauzy panels to soften the religious feel. Volunteers have fixed the broken organ so it plays again, now for parties.\u201cIf there would be a city in the world where you can go to church and a hackers\u2019 house,\u201d Mr. Cherkashin said, \u201cit would only be this one.\u201dOn the wall along one of the aisles, Evgeniy Lapchenko, the Ukrainian artist, has remade Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s \u201cGarden of Earthly Delights.\u201d Among the twisted human figures are tech luminaries: the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs taking a selfie, revelers at Burning Man and Mr. Brin of Google in a self-driving car.As for rebranding Hack Temple, Mr. Cherkashin hasn\u2019t found a new name he likes.\u201cIt can be called the Start-Up Temple,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just too boring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was 1993 and I was an awkward young teenager. Introverted and neither pretty, nor stylish, nor smart, I never fit in with any crowd in school.Then, at 12, I discovered rock \u2019n\u2019 roll through Tom Petty.My parents had gifted me a Sony Walkman. I\u2019d been getting relentlessly teased on the school bus. Kids would spit on me, call me \u201cdog,\u201d throw things at me, tell me things like, \u201cjust die because you\u2019re worthless,\u201d you name it.I remember the order of the songs that took me to and from junior high school every day on that 40-minute ride: In the mornings, \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d \u201cBreakdown,\u201d \u201cListen to Her Heart,\u201d \u201cI Need to Know,\u201d \u201cRefugee,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Do Me Like That,\u201d \u201cEven the Losers,\u201d \u201cHere Comes My Girl,\u201d \u201cThe Waiting,\u201d and \u201cYou Got Lucky\u201d on the ride in.

I wanted to end it all.As I sat my kitchen table one late afternoon shaking apart, I somehow had the strength to call 911 before I did something tragic.While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, for some strange reason I clicked on \u201cLearning to Fly\u201d on YouTube. I suddenly felt I wasn\u2019t alone and that somehow I would be all right.Now, two years later, I find myself sober, and life is taking on a richness I never thought was my due. Today, whenever I get low, I think of that song and know that whatever we go through in life, we are not alone. R.I.P. Tom, and thank you.\u2014 Kurt S.I am from the San Fernando Valley in Southern California and I remember being in a bar in Dublin in the late \u201990s, when the D.J. played \u201cFree Fallin\u2019.\u201d I was a 22-year-old college graduate trying to \u201cfind myself\u201d by backpacking across Europe.Many with Irish accents so thick I could barely decipher what they were saying were singing this Tom Petty song at the top of their lungs. They knew every single word by heart. Reseda, Mulholland, Ventura Boulevard, Tom Petty had people all over the world singing about my hometown and it felt like they were singing about me, about my own experiences, about my first boyfriend, about horse-loving me.He put my life to song and put my town on the map for all the world to experience. Halfway around the world, I \u201cfound myself\u201d in his songs, and it made me feel almost famous; he brought me free-fallin\u2019 back home from the inside of a Dublin bar.\u2014 Heidi EisipsThe company I worked for on 9/11 lost 65 of my fellow co-workers. I was one of the many lucky ones who made it out. It was a difficult time for myself and of course many, many others. When Petty appeared on a televised tribute concert, he performed \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down.\u201dIt gave me the hope at that critical time that as an American, we would pull together to get through the most difficult time possibly we have ever faced as a county since World War II. It became my personal mantra in many ways.\u2014 Ernie Vogt\u2014 Michael Oates PalmerMy favorite was \u201cHandle With Care.\u201d I\u2019d just gotten out of nine years of abuse in a relationship.

But while the focus on Russia is understandable, Facebook has been much less vocal about the abuse of its services in other parts of the world, where the stakes can be much higher than an election.The information war in Myanmar illuminates a growing problem for Facebook. The company successfully connected the world to a constellation of real-time communication and broadcasting tools, then largely left it to deal with the consequences.\u201cIn a lot of these countries, Facebook is the de facto public square,\u201d said Cynthia Wong, a senior internet researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u201cBecause of that, it raises really strong questions about Facebook needing to take on more responsibility for the harms their platform has contributed to.\u201d\u201cWe work hard to educate people about our services, highlight tools to help them protect their accounts and promote digital literacy,\u201d said Debbie Frost, a Facebook spokeswoman. \u201cTo be more effective in these efforts, we are working with civil society, safety partners, and governments \u2014 an approach we have found to be particularly important and effective in countries where people are rapidly coming online and experiencing the internet for the first time through a mobile phone.\u201d\u201cEverything shared on the phone is regarded as true,\u201d Mr. Purty said.In a statement, WhatsApp said, \u201cWhatsApp has made communications cheaper, easier and more reliable for millions of Indians \u2014 with all the benefits that brings. Though we understand that some people, sadly, have used WhatsApp to intimidate others and spread misinformation. It\u2019s why we encourage people to report problematic messages to WhatsApp so that we can take action.\u201dFacebook is not directly responsible for violent conflict, of course, and viral misinformation is hardly unique to its services. Before social media, there were email hoaxes and urban legends passed from person to person. But the speed of Facebook\u2019s growth in the developing world has made it an especially potent force among first-time internet users, who may not be appropriately skeptical of what they see online.But these efforts, as well-intentioned as they may be, have not stopped the violence, and Facebook does not appear to have made them a top priority. The company has no office in Myanmar, and neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Ms. Sandberg has made any public statements about the Rohingya crisis.Information wars in emerging markets may not represent as big a threat to Facebook\u2019s business as angry lawmakers in Washington. But people are dying, and communities are tearing themselves apart with the tools Facebook has built. That should qualify as an even greater emergency in Menlo Park.An article on Monday about abuses of Facebook\u2019s services in various countries rendered incorrectly the name of a government-run telecom company in Myanmar.

{"Headline": "As Apple and Facebook Chiefs Visit, Xi Jinping Vows Deeper Reform", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Just days after being likened to a king by President Trump, President Xi Jinping of China on Monday reiterated his commitment to reform while holding court before a group of wealthy and influential business leaders from his country and the United States.Mr. Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during an event shown on national television, addressed topics such as globalization, innovation and China\u2019s relationship with the United States at a gathering of executives who included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple; Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group; and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive.The reception was one of Mr. Xi\u2019s first public appearances with foreign visitors since a key Chinese Communist Party congress elevated him to the same exalted status as Mao Zedong, the country\u2019s founding father, and Deng Xiaoping, who led the country from 1978 until 1989.The event \u2014 just a week before Mr. Trump is scheduled to make his first visit to China \u2014 was most likely arranged to signal China\u2019s status as an economic superpower and peer of the United States.Chinese diplomats have used past business summits to promote their country\u2019s economic clout and influence with American companies before testier meetings with United States leaders and diplomats. On a 2015 trip to the United States, for example, Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle to visit American technology executives before going to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama.On Monday, Mr. Xi used his remarks to promote his credentials as a leader following Deng\u2019s footsteps as an economic reformer and defender of global trade.International investors and business groups have grown increasingly skeptical about Mr. Xi\u2019s commitment to opening up the Chinese economy. The Chinese government, citing worries that foreign technology and companies could compromise the country\u2019s security, has fed those doubts by tightening restrictions over the internet and advanced technology.And even as Mr. Xi reiterated his commitment to reform, he emphasized that China\u2019s sovereignty and security were of paramount importance.\u201cChina will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and developmental interests, and at the same time adhere to a fundamental national policy of opening up,\u201d he said.For the executives attending the event on Monday, the restrictions are hitting the bottom line. Facebook remains mostly blocked in China despite the company\u2019s lobbying efforts. Apple said this year that it would build a data center in the country to conform with a new Chinese cybersecurity law.The moves by Beijing have prompted calls in Washington for added scrutiny of Chinese companies seeking to do business in the United States or buy up American technology companies. Such issues are unlikely to be addressed in the coming meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, experts said.Mr. Xi\u2019s appeal to the executives on Monday in some ways contrasted with Mr. Trump\u2019s clashes with the leaders of some American tech companies. Other executives attending the event included Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive; Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba; Pony Ma, Tencent\u2019s chief executive; and Terry Guo, the chief executive of Foxconn.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}

But Ms. Greenhouse already knew a lot about Mr. Mulkeen, including how he behaved on first dates. Her best friend, Sarah Meier-Zimbler, had gone out with him almost a year before.\u201cMartin will roll his eyes at me, but I always feel I have to include the first time I heard about him in our origin story,\u201d Ms. Greenhouse said.But Ms. Greenhouse\u2019s plane never took off that night because an inch of snow had fallen on Heathrow Airport. \u201cI had to lug all my possessions back to London by tube \u2014 impossible to find a cab \u2014 go awkwardly back to my ex\u2019s in East London,\u201d she said, \u201cand then call Sarah and tell her my flight had been canceled.\u201d\u201cI remember, from examining his Facebook profile, that he sometimes had a mustache, that he had written for GQ, that he had this dashing photo in a navy peacoat and that he liked Richard Ford,\u201d Ms. Greenhouse said.Both Ms. Meier-Zimbler and Mr. Mulkeen say they had a good time on their date, but romantically it was a nonstarter. And then, months later, Ellen Knuti, a friend of Ms. Greenhouse and Ms. Meier-Zimbler from Wesleyan University, introduced Mr. Mulkeen to her new roommate: Ms. Greenhouse.Ms. Knuti and her older brother, Matt Knuti, had been hanging out in the same Brooklyn social circles. And Mr. Mulkeen, Mr. Knuti\u2019s roommate at Brown University, was part of that crowd of young professionals.Mr. Mulkeen remembers those days as a blur of outings to local dive bars: \u201cThe hip thing at that time was picklebacks, which is when you have a shot of whiskey and then a shot of pickle juice. Which I should say is a drink that I\u2019d be embarrassed to buy anyone now.\u201dBut the first time Ms. Greenhouse rendezvoused with Mr. Mulkeen and the Knuti siblings \u2014 Oct. 15, 2011, at Sharlene\u2019s, a bar in Park Slope \u2014 Mr. Mulkeen did the hip thing and bought Ms. Greenhouse a pickleback.That briny drink led them down a conversational path along which they talked about everything from poetry to politics. \u201cI felt he was sweetly charismatic and adorable,\u201d Ms. Greenhouse said. The evening ended, she said, with a game of footsie under the table.Or at least she believes it did. Mr. Mulkeen thinks otherwise. \u201cI definitely would have remembered if there was foot contact,\u201d he said. What they and several friends do recall without deviation is that within months of that dive bar meeting, Ms. Greenhouse and Mr. Mulkeen became inseparable.But not before Ms. Greenhouse received Ms. Meier-Zimbler\u2019s permission to remove Mr. Mulkeen from the friend zone.\u201cI remember talking to Sarah and saying, \u2018Would it be O.K. to date this guy?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was stealing her man, but I needed to formally ask her.\u201dMs. Meier-Zimbler, now married and an urban planner in Holyoke, Mass., said, \u201cWhen she and Martin first started dating, I could tell she wanted to be sensitive about it, especially because I was still single. But it became clear really fast that they were right for each other.\u201dIn 2014, after a couple of years of navigating career changes and spending nights together in Mr. Mulkeen\u2019s Crown Heights apartment, the couple bought a brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Mr. Mulkeen knew he wanted to marry Ms. Greenhouse. While they were renovating their house together, his thoughts on how to propose intensified.\u201cI really wanted to do it right,\u201d he said. By the middle of 2016, he decided that Paris, where Ms. Greenhouse had lived as a child, was the ideal place. \u201cWe had been going there once a year together since we met, and she has a lot of nostalgia about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like it really brings her alive.\u201dMr. Mulkeen arranged a surprise trip in late September of that year, clearing the dates with Ms. Greenhouse\u2019s deputy editor at The New Yorker and telling her parents of his plan to propose. They encouraged him, sending him off with a diamond ring that had belonged to a great-grandmother of Ms. Greenhouse\u2019s.\u201cIt was an overcast day, but basically he was like, \u2018Let\u2019s eat these in the garden.\u2019 We sat in those green chairs Bryant Park imitates,\u201d Ms. Greenhouse said. The mood? Awkward. \u201cI got a bit nervous,\u201d Mr. Mulkeen said. \u201cI think Emily could sense what I wanted to say, and she tried to comfort me by being jokey. She sang a little and put her scarf around me.\u201dAnd then the words, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d came out. Through tears, Ms. Greenhouse said yes.\u201cIt\u2019s weird because Martin is the person I\u2019m most comfortable with in the world, but in a moment like that there can still be this welling up of nervousness and all of a sudden we\u2019re almost timid around each other,\u201d she said.In the days before their wedding, Ms. Greenhouse said she read many love letters. Not just any letters, but Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s exchanges with Alfred Stieglitz, Iris Murdoch\u2019s letters, Saul Bellow\u2019s, Napoleon to Josephine, Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s with Robert Lowell.In his handwritten vows, Mr. Mulkeen praised Ms. Greenhouse\u2019s fierce independence, intelligence and wit.Mr. Mulkeen\u2019s childhood friend, Matt Pantell, said that in Ms. Greenhouse, Mr. Mulkeen had found someone who shared his intellect and love of the written word.\u201cEven when they argue, it\u2019s poetic,\u201d Dr. Pantell said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Firms Learn to Move an Ancient Product With New-Age Tech", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil and MoneySUNBURY-ON-THAMES, England \u2014 BP\u2019s troubleshooters here received a call for help from colleagues in Azerbaijan. Sand was invading oil wells from the rocks outside. To avoid damage, the operators were choking the wells back, reducing revenues.Two tech-savvy specialists, Prad Thiruvenkatanathan, a research scientist, and Tommy Langnes, a sand expert, came up with a novel fix. They used fiber-optic cable to gather the sounds coming from the wells deep in the earth. Inspired by apps like Shazam that recognize the voices of pop stars, they figured how to distinguish the sonic signature of sand from other sounds, like flowing oil. They also installed computers on the production platforms to sift staggering volumes of data coming from the wells down to manageable levels.Using these tools, BP can identify where sand is coming in and patch the breaches instead of choking down the whole well. The flows from one well have already increased by nearly 50 percent, potentially a huge gain if the technology is rolled out through BP\u2019s global network, where sand is a common problem. They are already using a similar tool to detect leaks and other potential hazards.\u201cIt is just like your iPhone,\u201d Mr. Langnes said. \u201cWe have built the phone. We have a couple of apps installed. Now the R&D team is working on new apps to install on the digital platform.\u201dThe oil industry has long been of two minds when it comes to high technology. Oil companies like BP and Italy\u2019s Eni use powerful supercomputers to crunch data from sound waves into images of petroleum deposits in the ground. Yet the industry has been resistant to change in other areas, like the process of producing oil.On weather-battered offshore platforms in Britain\u2019s North Sea, for instance, technicians still walk around with \u201cbig pieces of paper in the rain, wind,\u201d said Claire Day, a BP operations engineer. \u201cIt is not an ideal way to work.\u201dChange, though, is coming as companies like BP and Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, embrace technology to help cut costs. Anders Brun, a consultant in the oil and gas practice at McKinsey & Company, says analyzing huge amount of data to optimize processes like oil production and automate activities like drilling is the logical next step.Before oil prices plunged in 2014, Mr. Brun said, gaining access to natural resources rather than cost-cutting was the priority. Now the heads of the big oil companies, inspired by what they see in areas like banking, retailing and mining, want to do the same. McKinsey estimates that through activities like using big data to analyze the performance of various production platforms, oil companies can improve their profits by up to $11 per barrel, or $300 billion a year by 2025.\u201cThe potential is quite staggering,\u201d he said.Companies are forging ahead in some key areas. BP, for instance, is experimenting with automating drilling on natural gas wells in a new field in Oman. BP would like the driller\u2019s role to be more like that of an airplane pilot, who oversees the computers actually fine-tuning the plane.Leigh-Ann Russell, a drilling executive, said that automation would make operations safer by taking people off installations and out of harm\u2019s way. By reducing the chances of human error that she said was responsible for most safety incidents, automating drilling rigs would also improve business performance, because a lot of waste \u201cis often caused by human error as well.\u201dOil companies are also very gingerly experimenting with technology that can help remove people from offshore platforms, which produce much of the world\u2019s oil. Any job that can be moved to land represents a big saving because offshore workers are highly paid and need to be housed, fed and rotated every few weeks by helicopter.When BP recently moved a drilling rig 350 miles across the North Sea, the three-person team responsible for positioning the vessel, remained on land. They worked from the company\u2019s hub in Aberdeen, Scotland, through a remote positioning and monitoring system. BP estimates that keeping teams \u201con the beach\u201d will save $20,000 on each of these moves.The employees that remain on the rigs may receive cellphones and computer tablets insulated to avoid sparks that could set off explosions. The intention is for them to use these devices to click through tasks like maintenance checks, enter data and hear back quickly if something is wrong.\u201cYour training burden is massively reduced as well,\u201d said Ms. Day. \u201cNo one has taught any of us how to use Facebook or WhatsApp. You just pick them up.\u201dStill, some observers think it will not be easy to make radical changes, especially on offshore platforms, where workers may think they have enough to do without learning new tricks.Andrew Tidey, global head of performance improvement at energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, said that people in control rooms might already have more information than they could manage.\u201cIs the real issue information or is it human behavior?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe will see how that plays out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "She Finished Last on the Ice, but Moved Forward", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn OlympicsOBERSTDORF, Germany \u2014 Zahra Lari of the United Arab Emirates did not qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics in figure skating in her final opportunity on Saturday. In fact, she finished last among 33 skaters at the Nebelhorn Trophy competition here. But, for Muslim women, Lari considered this a step forward, not backward.Lari, 22, is the only athlete who wears a hijab on the international skating circuit. Five years ago, at her first major competition, in Italy, points were deducted from her score because some judges considered her head covering a costume prop.She later met with officials of the International Skating Union. Such deductions are no longer being made, she said. The I.S.U. rules say only that clothing must be \u201cmodest, dignified and appropriate for athletic competition \u2014 not garish or theatrical in design.\u201dWhile there is no explicit prohibition against hijabs, Lari would like the skating union\u2019s rule book to clarify that they are specifically allowed, a matter the I.S.U. has discussed but so far not taken a position on.\u201cI\u2019m not sure we should exaggerate this and create more problems for ourselves,\u201d said Alexander Lakernik, a vice president of the skating union, who suggested that judges now already look past the hijab.At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Tugba Karademir of Turkey became the first Muslim woman to compete in figure skating at the Games.At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the sprinter Ruqaya al Ghasara of Bahrain was said to have become the first woman to wear a hijab in the Games. At the 2012 London Olympics, Saudi Arabia sent women to the Olympics for the first time. One of its athletes, Sarah Attar, an American-born half miler competing in a hijab, received a standing ovation for her persistence after finishing far behind her competitors in a heat of the 800 meters.Roquiya Cochran, Lari\u2019s mother and manager and a native of North Carolina, said, \u201cEveryone has a place in the world, and they should have the ability and right to find their place.\u201dDespite its elitist reputation, figure skating has grown increasingly inclusive. Kuwait and Qatar have inquired with the U.A.E. about potential entry into the International Skating Union. So has Lebanon, which already fields Winter Olympic teams in Alpine skiing. At the Nebelhorn competition, Julian Zhi Jie Yee became the first skater from Malaysia to qualify for the Olympics.Lari said she still hears criticism via social media, always anonymously: \u201cThis is against your culture. It\u2019s not part of your religion.\u201d No stranger has complained to her face.\u201cIt\u2019s just close-minded people who don\u2019t understand the sport or that there\u2019s nothing wrong with it,\u201d Lari said.There has been another, more amusing reaction \u2014 marriage proposals on her Facebook fan page.Her mother laughed: \u201cIt\u2019s immediate delete and block.\u201dAt one time, Lari has said in interviews, her father, Fadhel, a telecommunications executive, had reservations about her skating. But he is now supportive, and the sport is a family affair. Lari\u2019s parents started the first official skating club in the U.A.E., and her mother is the country\u2019s sports manager for figure skating.\u201cThe value of what Zahra is doing is huge, not just in the country, but I think for all young Muslim girls to have confidence in themselves and to know that if there something they want to do in their lives, they should live their dreams and go for it,\u201d Cochran said.Lari, who has a sponsorship deal with Nike, said, \u201cI think they\u2019re really fighting for girls in the Arab region. It\u2019s great having a big sports brand doing that.\u201dLari began skating at 12 after watching the Disney movie \u201cIce Princess.\u201d A full-time student at Abu Dhabi University, she sandwiches her training between her studies of environmental health and safety and the availability of ice time in a country with a growing interest in hockey and only three Olympic-size rinks.She trains from 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m., attends class, returns to the rink from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m., goes back to school, then trains off the ice from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. It can be exhausting, and Lari feels self-imposed pressure to represent the new aspirations of an entire country. But she is young and there is time to improve before trying to qualify for the 2022 Games in Beijing.\u201cI feel proud,\u201d Lari said, but when she is on the ice, \u201cit doesn\u2019t cross my mind what a big thing I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m just doing something I love.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "$250 for Dinner, Tradition Not Included, at Vespertine", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookCULVER CITY, Calif. \u2014 Was the building \u2026 breathing?Several hours and 17 unrecognizable courses later, when I was escorted to another heated block in the garden for tea and house-bottled digestifs of various herbs and fruits, the original three chords were there to greet me. The hum was still in my ears when I went to sleep that night. I can hear it now.Vespertine gets inside your head. If you squirt yourself with the vial of fragrance you get when you leave, it may get under your skin, too.11 PhotosI spent most of an evening in that building and I still have no idea what he was talking about. The servers acted less like ancient space aliens than like monks running a monastic retreat for stressed-out nonbelievers. They glided around in black slippers and flowing black tunics, quiet as ninjas. When they were not going up the staircase to the third-floor kitchen or depositing food arrangements on the acrylic tabletops with a semi-explanatory murmur (\u201cgiant kelp with whipped honey and yuzu emulsion\u201d), they stood motionlessly off to the side, looking either at the horizon or at the wall.When he defines the cooking as rootless, Mr. Kahn is on more solid footing. Early in his career he worked in the pastry kitchens of Per Se and Alinea, so he knows how to take pains. A great deal of the pains he takes at Vespertine seem to go into making the food look like something other than food.That, at least, is how it struck me after one meal at this \u201cgastronomical experiment,\u201d as the website has it. Writing up my preliminary impressions seems more appropriate than a full starred review for a work that is explicitly, intentionally in progress, one whose aim is to do something restaurants haven\u2019t done before. Never mind that this has been the aim of a small parade of restaurants from El Bull\u00ed on, and that Vespertine falls right in step with that parade, however much it may pretend to have sprung from a fallen spore from another galaxy.The first dish of the night seemed to be a sequined branch on an inclined black tortilla. The tortilla was a clay plate made, like many of the serving pieces, by a local sculptor named Robert Boldz. The branch was a water spinach stem brushed with turkey emulsion and bedazzled with little yellow pike eggs, tiny finger-lime orbs, pink and purple flowers the size of shirt-collar buttons, and whatnot. I like salads flavored with poultry juices, and I liked this.Next came what I thought of as A Wheel Inside a Wheel, a wide looping belt of kelp stuck with blots of lovage sauce to the inside of a black ceramic hoop. There was a bloop of whipped honey inside the hoop, too. I stared, looking for a way in, until a server said, \u201cYou can think of it as chips and dip.\u201d Oh, of course.Some courses were almost inviting. Others seemed determined not to be eaten at all, like the C-curve of black wafer pressed into a C-curve of black ceramic. It wasn\u2019t at all clear which part was supposed to go in my mouth. I gambled on the wafer, which was a crumbly savory cookie made from black currants and dried onions and brushed with black currant jam.It went on from there, the portions growing slightly more substantial. Nothing tasted as weird as it looked. For this I was grateful. Nearly every dish tasted good, in one way or another, although more than one juxtaposed something unquestionably delicious with other things that turned up empty-handed to the flavor party: wonderful lobster in a bittersweet sauce of malted barley syrup and butter with a dull white spill of tapioca; exceptional brined scallop, sauced with yuzu and a tea made from Douglas fir tips, with unexciting ovals of white asparagus standing up like marble headstones in a cemetery.He isn\u2019t trying to dress up his cooking so much as he\u2019s trying to wrestle it away from familiarity. He certainly uses flowers for their colors \u2014 none of them tasted like much \u2014 but the blossoms he chooses are not normal restaurant ingredients. Gardeners may spot sweet alyssum, passionflower and yarrow, but others probably won\u2019t.Mr. Kahn\u2019s innovation is to cut that thread. The rhubarb compote he serves with heirloom turkey may or may not be an analogue for cranberries, but in general he faithfully carries out his promise to uproot Vespertine\u2019s cooking from tradition and culture. You\u2019re not meant to know what you\u2019re eating, which may be why the servers\u2019 monkish murmurs cover just a fraction of what they are depositing in front of you.This would be all right if the flavors made as strong an impression as the shapes they\u2019d taken. But I remember the way my meal looked much more vividly than how it tasted. Mr. Kahn is letting his gifts as a sculptor and colorist, which are real, get the upper hand.Before dinner ended, though, I\u2019d had enough. If I hadn\u2019t been guilted into paying $30 in advance for after-dinner drinks in the garden by an unsubtle poke from the ticketing website (\u201cWe ask that all guests participate\u201d), I would have called for the car.Another Adri\u00e0 legacy is the idea that creativity in cooking means a sharp break with the past. Mr. Achatz picked up on this when he named his restaurant Alinea, after the medieval symbol marking a new paragraph \u2014 a new line of thought.I have never seen a restaurant try as hard as Vespertine to erase everything that came before. While I was eating there I didn\u2019t miss the good old earth, but I did think that Mr. Kahn\u2019s new planet needed a few more signs of life.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the architect who designed Vespertine\u2019s building.

{"Headline": "To Mend a Birth Defect, Surgeons Operate on the Patient Within the Patient", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Healing EdgeHOUSTON \u2014 The patient, still inside his mother\u2019s womb, came into focus on flat screens in a darkened operating room. Fingers, toes, the soles of his feet \u2014 all exquisite, all perfectly formed.But not so his lower back. Smooth skin gave way to an opening that should not have been there, a bare oval exposing a white rim of bone and the nerves of the spinal cord.\u201cAll right, it\u2019s the real deal,\u201d said Dr. Michael A. Belfort, the chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and obstetrician and gynecologist-in-chief of Texas Children\u2019s Hospital.The fetus, 24 weeks and two days old, less than two pounds, was about to have surgery. He had a severe form of spina bifida, in which the backbone and spinal cord do not develop properly. Children born with this condition usually cannot walk, and suffer from fluid buildup in the brain, lack of bladder control and other complications.A pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. William Whitehead, joined Dr. Belfort at the operating table. Doctors have been performing fetal surgery to repair spina bifida since the 1990s; it is not a cure, but can lessen the degree of disability.But now Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead are testing a new, experimental technique \u2014 one that some in the field are eager to learn, but that others regard warily, questioning its long-term safety for the fetus.The surgeons had made a wide incision in the mother\u2019s lower abdomen, gently lifted out her uterus \u2014 still attached internally \u2014 and made two tiny, 4-millimeter slits. In one, they inserted a \u201cfetoscope,\u201d a small telescope fitted with a camera, light and grasping tool. The second slit was for other miniature instruments.Lit from within, the uterus glowed, red and magical in the darkened room.Spina bifida occurs early, at three to four weeks of pregnancy, when the tissue forming the spinal column should fold into a tube but does not close properly. There are 1,500 to 2,000 cases a year in the United States.The causes are not fully understood, but in some cases a deficiency in the B-vitamin folic acid plays a role, which is why supplements are recommended for pregnant women and the vitamin is added to grain and cereal products.Introducing prenatal surgery for spina bifida was a bold step. In the early days, doctors were so worried about risk that they operated only for conditions that would be fatal if left unrepaired; if the surgery did harm, it would be to a fetus that would have died anyway.Spina bifida is generally not fatal, so the standard practice was to operate after birth. But the results of postnatal surgery were mixed: most children could not walk and had other problems.Doctors began to suspect that outcomes might be better if they could fix the defect before birth. Some of the spinal damage is caused by amniotic fluid, which turns increasingly toxic to the exposed nerve tissue as the pregnancy progresses and the fetus passes more and more wastes into the fluid.Surgeons thought that if the opening could be closed before birth, sealing out the fluid, some of the nerve damage might be averted. They began operating in the 1990s, but it was not clear the surgery was helping.\u201cThe percent who benefit, I wish it was higher,\u201d Dr. Whitehead said, adding that so far prenatal surgery does not seem to help with bladder incontinence, and most children with spina bifida need catheters to pass urine.The ideal time for the surgery is from 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy, Dr. Belfort said \u2014 early enough to prevent some nerve damage, but late enough so that the baby has a decent chance of surviving and doing well if something goes wrong and it has to be delivered.His patient, Lexi Royer, 28, and her husband, Joshuwa, 29, were high-school sweethearts who had always wanted children. But Mrs. Royer had health problems that doctors said made pregnancy unlikely. She had one miscarriage and then did not conceive again.So the couple were thrilled in May to discover that she was pregnant. During an ultrasound exam at 13 weeks, they saw their son for the first time.\u201cThere were a lot of happy tears,\u201d Mrs. Royer said. \u201cThen the ultrasound tech said she had to go back and get the doctor.\u201dA wrenching series of tests and visits to specialists followed. With each one, the news got worse. The defect was big and severe, and the brain stem was being pulled down into the spinal column.\u201cIt sounded like we were looking at brain damage, feeding tubes, a breathing tube, a wheelchair, just a bad quality of life,\u201d Mrs. Royer said.Termination was offered as an option, and Mrs. Royer felt that doctors were pushing it. But this might be their only chance to have a child.They wanted to learn more about their son\u2019s condition. Mrs. Royer, a hairdresser, and her husband, a firefighter and emergency medical technician, turned to the internet and discovered Facebook groups for parents of children with spina bifida. Some reported good results from a procedure that doctors in their home city, San Diego, had never even heard of: fetoscopic surgery.In early September, they went to Houston for two days of testing. The results confirmed that their son had a severe spinal defect, but still gave them hope.\u201cHe was kicking his legs, moving all the way down to his feet,\u201d Mrs. Royer said. \u201cHe has function down to what they call the \u2018gas pedal\u2019 movement. His ankle is flexing and pointing, a really good sign for being able to walk.\u201dEven if he could not walk, she said, needing a wheelchair does not ruin a person\u2019s quality of life.More important, the doctors thought surgery had a good chance of eliminating the need for a lifelong implanted shunt to drain excess fluid from his brain. The devices often need replacing, which requires more surgery, and they can lead to infection.Mrs. Royer acknowledged there was no guarantee that her son would be free of a shunt. But she said she and her husband had \u201chappiness and peace\u201d after deciding to go for the surgery.On Sept. 26, the day before the operation, Mr. and Mrs. Royer and her parents met with the medical team at Texas Children\u2019s.With more than a dozen doctors and nurses in the conference room, it was standing room only. All would be involved in the operation.Dr. Belfort reviewed the test results, telling the group that the fetus had a \u201csignificant lesion\u201d involving much of his lower back. But he added, \u201cHe\u2019s able to do the gas pedal. That\u2019s a great thing. There\u2019s a lot of function to save.\u201dAddressing Mrs. Royer, he said: \u201cThis is experimental surgery, with no guarantee. You are the person who will take the risk for another person. There is no mandate for you to do this. Nobody will think less of you if change your mind, and you can change your mind until the last minute, until you go to sleep.\u201dEarly the next morning, with Mrs. Royer under general anesthesia, the surgery began in an overheated operating room ideal for the fetus but sweltering for doctors and nurses in caps, gloves and surgical gowns.During the standard prenatal surgery for spina bifida, surgeons cut open the woman\u2019s abdomen and uterus to reach the fetus. But the newer, experimental approach is different.Dr. Belfort opened Mrs. Royer\u2019s lower abdomen, but not her uterus. Instead, he eased the uterus out of her body and inserted the fetoscope, and then, through another slit, surgical tools. The doctors drained out the amniotic fluid and pumped in carbon dioxide to keep the uterus expanded, giving them room to work and allowing them to see better and cauterize when needed.They gave the fetus an anesthetic injection and then, guided by images on the video screens, began to operate on him, tugging skin and membranes over the naked spinal cord and sewing them tightly shut with five stitches to seal out amniotic fluid.Because the defect was so large, they made \u201crelaxing incisions\u201d along his sides, to loosen the skin so they could pull it across his back. The cuts would heal, though they would leave scars.Every few minutes, a pediatric cardiologist called out the fetal heart rate, which held steady at a normal rate of about 150 beats a minute. When the surgery was finished, the doctors replaced the amniotic fluid with saline.The surgery took three hours. The standard, open operation is faster and easier, but Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead think their method will prove safer for both the mother and the fetus.With the open procedure, the cut into the uterus increases the risk of early labor and premature birth, which puts the fetus at risk for a host of complications.The incision also raises the risk of uterine rupture during labor, and requires that the mother give birth by cesarean section, which is generally riskier for women than a vaginal birth.The scarring on the uterus from the two operations makes it likely that she will need cesareans for future births, and also increases the risk of placental problems that can be life-threatening. The small slits for the fetoscopes are thought to reduce these risks.To develop their fetoscopic procedure, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead operated on sheep and spent several hundred hours over the course of two years practicing on a simulator that they had created. It consisted of a rubber kickball, about the size of a basketball \u2014 like a uterus at 24 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 with a doll inside, wrapped in chicken skin that they cut to mimic the defect in spina bifida.They would insert fetoscopes into the ball and, eyes on the monitor, work together to sew up the chicken skin. They completed more than 30 simulated operations, including two sessions in an operating room, with a full surgical team assembled. They still use the simulator at least twice a month to keep up their skills, Dr. Belfort said.They operated on their first patient in July 2014. In August, in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, they reported on their first 28 cases. So far, the results have been good, though the numbers are small.No fetuses have died, few have needed shunts, and some of the mothers have been able to have vaginal deliveries. Their pregnancies appear to last longer, coming closer to full-term than with the open procedure. More research is needed, but other medical centers have begun adopting the technique. Surgeons at Johns Hopkins have used it to treat five patients, and Dr. Belfort is helping to train colleagues at Stanford.Doctors who practice the open procedure are critical, and warn that the carbon dioxide pumped into the uterus may harm the fetus and cause neurological problems. Dr. Belfort said there has been no evidence of harm. But time will tell.Mrs. Royer, who will stay in an apartment in Houston for the rest of her pregnancy, had a painful recovery from the surgery. But she has no regrets.\u201cIt\u2019s not done by any means, but I definitely feel it\u2019s the right thing for us,\u201d she said. \u201cSeeing the ultrasound and how good he\u2019s doing, moving his ankles and feet, it\u2019s such a happy moment.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine going on further in the pregnancy not knowing every day what damage is being done and if he\u2019s getting worse. It\u2019s such a relief to move forward.\u201dHer due date is Jan. 14.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sending Relief by Air and Sea to Puerto Rico From the Bronx", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe pleas for help, arriving in text messages and on Facebook, have not relented, filling Lymaris Albors\u2019s phone since the hurricane that roared across Puerto Rico, her homeland. The people on the other end were asking for all sorts of things: food, generators, solar lights, tarpaulins to take the place of roofs shredded by the hurricane.As she assembled the items and looked for ways to deliver them, her corner office in the South Bronx had been transformed into a makeshift command center. A growing list of needs covered one whiteboard. The logistical details of how she planned to ship them filled another. And there was yet another list, this one with the people and the groups on the island to whom she hoped to send aid.\u201cHow and when,\u201d she conceded, \u201cI have no idea.\u201dMs. Albors has a number of titles at the Acacia Network, a health and social services organization that is among the largest founded and run by New York\u2019s Puerto Rican diaspora. She is usually the chief of staff to the chief executive officer and vice president of business development. But for the past few weeks, her work has boiled down to one all-consuming job: coordinator, putting together the nonprofit organization\u2019s relief efforts for Puerto Rico.Already, two planes loaded with supplies, including one with dozens of generators, had flown to the island, and Acacia employees had been dispatched there to help. Next, they planned to fill a cargo container, which would be sent by ship.The work at Acacia is just one piece of New York\u2019s vast official and unofficial response, as Hurricane Maria\u2019s aftermath has, in many ways, both tested and underscored the bonds between the city and Puerto Rico.Ms. Albors, for her part, has been propelled by a sense of duty, her own bond with Puerto Rico. Work, though, has also given her a place to channel the despair and anxiety that the storm has stirred. She had heard from her nieces on the island; one, who spent the summer with her in New York, wiped tears from her eyes in a videochat with her aunt. Ms. Albors still had not talked to her mother.\u201cI can tell you that I can deal with everything in my life, except when my island is in crisis,\u201d Ms. Albors said in her office a week after the hurricane made landfall. \u201cThere\u2019s this deep-rooted love for Puerto Rico, and my family \u2014 everyone\u2019s there. I\u2019m the only one here.\u201dBy a window, Ms. Albors had one more whiteboard. Any time she felt like Acacia had accomplished something, she wrote it there. She needed the reminder that progress was being made.\u201cWe\u2019re so committed to the island,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. She repeated a line heard often in New York since the hurricane: \u201cIt is personal.\u201dThe Acacia Network has a complex of buildings in the Mount Hope neighborhood of the South Bronx. Its work includes physical and mental heath care services, alcohol and substance abuse treatment, vocational training, day care and nursing homes. Among its projects is an affordable housing residence for older people being built in the Puerto Rican city of Toa Alta.After Hurricane Maria made landfall, on Sept. 20, organization officials said they decided almost immediately to start their own effort.They began with a fund-raiser, with their own donation of $1 million. (So far, they have raised another $700,000.) Then, Ms. Albors heard from a children\u2019s hospital that had enough food for its patients but not for relatives and others who were also in the hospital. Three days after the storm, she said, the organization found a supplier that was still open and paid for food.And then there was the container. In a neighborhood of narrow streets, stubby blocks and pedestrians crossing wherever they please, the 53-foot long blue cargo container, through a feat of truck driving, had been delivered to a slice of pavement outside one of Acacia\u2019s buildings. A Puerto Rican flag hung off the front.\u201cThings that are needed, we\u2019re sending,\u201d Raul Russi, the chief executive of Acacia, said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to try it our way and see if we can get it done.\u201dOn a recent evening, a crew loaded construction supplies and solar lights into the container. A truck on its way from Texas carrying 60 generators was somewhere near Philadelphia. As soon as those were placed inside, the container would be sealed, setting off for Puerto Rico in the morning.Mr. Russi said he knew the container was a gamble, acknowledging the accounts of other shipments stalled at the port in San Juan. Even so, he was optimistic. If the supplies were not delivered to the intended recipients, he figured, it was likely they would end up with someone who needed them.\u201cIf we can get through with one shipment,\u201d Mr. Russi said, \u201cthen I\u2019m going to keep working and send these shipments until either we run out of money or things get situated in Puerto Rico.\u201dThe shipment carried items that had been on Ms. Albors\u2019s list. Her cellphone is always in hand, almost always buzzing. \u201cEvery five minutes,\u201d she said, \u201csomebody gets access to Wi-Fi.\u201d And like clock work, another message asking for help lands in her inbox. Some were sent directly to her, and others took a more circuitous route, funneling their way through the city\u2019s Puerto Rican community.One of those messages came from Christopher Young and Rosa de la Sota, the architects designing Acacia\u2019s senior complex in Toa Alta.They reached out about another affordable housing complex they had designed, near San Juan. They had checked on the residents after the storm and found, Mr. Young said, that they needed \u201cjust about everything\u201d: food, water, cleaning supplies. Ms. Albors set up a line of credit with a local supplier for $5,000.\u201cReally, it\u2019s very fragile here,\u201d he said. \u201cLike everyone, we\u2019re trying \u2014 day by day, in this new reality we\u2019re living in Puerto Rico \u2014 to move forward.\u201dSince the storm, Ms. Albors has worked around the clock: late nights in the office, calls with Mr. Russi first thing in the morning. Sleep, she said, has been difficult to come by.\u201cI always work like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m always on a mission here.\u201dBut now the work also kept her occupied. Ms. Albors, who came to New York in 2000, grew up in Manat\u00ed, a city on the northern coast. Like much of the island, it, too, was pounded by the hurricane. Ms. Albors thought of her nieces and nephews \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re my life,\u201d she said \u2014 and her mother, who is in her 70s and was alone in Manat\u00ed.As the days wore on, the list of needs kept growing. The messages kept arriving. But she could tell a tide had shifted: Now, she was receiving pictures of smiling volunteers handing out bags of supplies and of teenagers cleaning the homes of older people. The other list, the one by the window, grew, too: More things were getting done.Mr. Russi described the work as a collective effort. But Ms. Albors, he said, was at the center of it. \u201cI can move things; I can make things happen,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has such great connections in Puerto Rico. She has a real good network and good sense of the island, so giving her charge of this thing has been a godsend.\u201dThe cargo container still had not made it to the island. It was supposed to take a week to get there, but then, the shipping company told her, it would be at least a week longer. But, she said, that had not halted their work: Another plane was bringing 50 more generators and more than 1,000 tarps.And as her phone kept vibrating with messages, she received one she had been waiting for. There was a picture of her mother, leaning back in a rocking chair, safe and content. Ms. Albors, at last, felt a wave of relief.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better Way to Trace Scattered Refugees", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesThe cellphone in Masomo\u2019s bedroom in Ottawa, Canada, rang at 6:30 a.m. on May 26. Usually he turns his phone off at night, but the night before he had forgotten \u2014 fortunately.He heard a voice in French. \u201cI\u2019m calling from Nairobi,\u201d a man said, then asked Masomo his name, his village and whether he had family members he has not heard from for years. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve found your brother,\u201d the man said. \u201cShall we patch him though?\u201d Masomo, who works at a university, had been searching for Ishara for almost a decade. (He asked that I do not identify him or his brother, so these are childhood names.)Masomo had moved to Ottawa in 2005 at the invitation of a relative, leaving his natal village in the Kivu region of Democratic Republic of Congo, where civilians have been under siege from armies, militias and warlords for decades.His family was prominent, and therefore a frequent target. \u201cYou are emotionally numb and in survival mode all the time,\u201d said Masomo. \u201cEvery time you hear a bullet, you try to figure out which direction it\u2019s coming from and run the opposite way. We spent many nights in the bush under the trees.\u201dIn 2009, one of Masomo\u2019s brothers and a cousin were killed, and the family fled. From Ottawa, Masomo lost contact. There were no phones in the village, so he called people he knew in a nearby city, and contacted the Red Cross. No one knew where his family had gone.Most United Nations agencies rely for family tracing on the International Committee of the Red Cross, the global network of national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. Florence Anselmo, who directs the I.C.R.C.\u2019s Central Tracing Agency, said that the I.C.R.C. and United Nations agencies can\u2019t look in one another\u2019s databases. That\u2019s necessary for privacy reasons, but it\u2019s an obstacle to family tracing.The organization is working on developing an algorithm for matching, but for now, the search engines are human. \u201cWhen we talk about tracing, it\u2019s not only about data matching,\u201d Anselmo said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole part about accompanying families: the human aspect, professionals as well as volunteers who are able to look for people \u2014 even go house to house if needed.\u201dThis is the mom-and-pop general store model of tracing: The customer makes a request at the counter, then a shopkeeper with knowledge of her goods and a kind smile goes to the back and brings it out, throwing in a lollipop. But the world has 65 million forcibly displaced people, a record number. Personalized help to choose from limited stock is appropriate in many cases. But it cannot possibly be enough.Refunite seeks to become the eBay of family tracing. In 2005, Christopher and David Mikkelsen helped a friend, an Afghani refugee in Copenhagen named Mansour, look for his family. The Mikkelsens eventually found one of his brothers in southern Russia, and helped Mansour and the brother to meet. \u201cThe agency in Denmark literally did not know what its counterparts in Sweden or Australia had,\u201d said Christopher. \u201cThis was absurd.\u201dChristopher was a musician and writer, and David was a documentary filmmaker. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about refugees, or about technology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we thought: People scatter globally. We need a global solution. Just create a simple Excel spreadsheet and share it internationally! How hard can this be?\u201dPretty hard, apparently. During 2006 and 2007, the brothers took their idea to international agencies and refugee aid groups all over the world. No one bit.So they did it themselves, finding an enthusiastic response from corporations and their foundations. \u201cWe went from being laughed out of every office in this field to having access at every single C.E.O.\u2019s office in every company we approached,\u201d said Christopher. SAP, a global software company, built Refunite\u2019s first management system, and Ericsson built its first mobile platform. FedEx donates shipping, the H & M foundation is sponsoring a pilot of interactive voice response in Pakistan, and S.A.S., the Scandinavian airline, donates flights.Now United Nations organizations and refugee groups work with Refunite. The International Rescue Committee was Refunite\u2019s partner for its first work in South Sudan. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees facilitates Refunite\u2019s outreach in camps and refers family tracing cases; Refunite, in turn, sends people who need protection to the U.N.H.C.R.Because so much is done free of cost by partners, Refunite can be the world\u2019s largest missing persons platform and still be tiny; it has a staff of 25 and an annual budget of $2 million.In addition to the basics, registrants can add personal information they believe will help family members identify them \u2014 a childhood nickname, for example. The algorithm identifies potential matches. The searcher can then contact a possible match through the Refunite platform.Mikkelsen said that so far, 750,000 people have registered. Countries with the most users are Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan and Iraq.That\u2019s a tiny percentage of the world\u2019s displaced and their families, and Refunite\u2019s numbers reflect this; Mikkelsen said there have been about 6,000 reconnections so far.What about that ultimate search machine, Facebook? Well, Facebook is only for people who can read, have smartphones and can afford data. In some countries, that\u2019s most people \u2014 Syrians, for example, are typically educated and middle class, and indeed, few of them use Refunite.\u201cI think about a woman, 55 years old, three children, semiliterate, who flees from Somalia to Kenya,\u201d said Mikkelsen. \u201cIf I can serve her needs, we\u2019re in position to capture the full arc.\u201dIt\u2019s not easy. People can use Refunite\u2019s web platform in 12 languages and its text service in five. But refugees speak hundreds. It\u2019s relatively simple to create text service in a new language. It\u2019s very difficult to create interactive voice response, because machines need to learn from lots of material.Then there are challenges with names. There are many, many Abdi Mohameds in Somalia, for example. And cultural practices vary. Mikkelsen talked about one young man who had trouble filling in his mother\u2019s name. A mother, in his parlance, was a woman who helped raise him. \u201cI have five mothers,\u201d he said.The biggest challenge is getting the word out. Radio stations serving refugee camps or large groups of displaced people are crucial. Mobile operators like Safaricom in Kenya blast out millions of text messages in local languages about Refunite. Then word-of-mouth \u2014 the best advertising \u2014 kicks in. At the start of one text blast campaign, 80 percent of people calling the text center had heard about Refunite through a text. Three months later, 80 percent had heard about Refunite through word-of-mouth.\u201cMy brother had grown into an older man after that long,\u201d Masomo said. \u201cBut of course I could recognize the voice.\u201dAfter effusive greetings, the brothers talked about their parents (who were well) and other family members, who had landed with Ishara in a refugee camp in Uganda. They exchanged mobile numbers. In all, they talked for 15 minutes.Refunite\u2019s work is done with the first phone call; the organization doesn\u2019t facilitate in-person reunions. Masamo and Ishara have called each other many times since the first call.Then in August, Masomo flew to Uganda. There was joy in seeing his family. \u201cBut we mourned together people we had lost,\u201d he said. And while he lives a stable life in Canada, his family in Uganda left all they had behind, and in the refugee camp there are few ways to make a living. Health care is also hard to get, he said.It was painful for him to see. \u201cI am trying to find information to help them resettle,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many obstacles. It is more difficult than I had thought.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Russia-Linked Ads Came in Many Disguises", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Russians who posed as Americans on Facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises.\u201cWe\u2019re obviously deeply disturbed by this,\u201d Joel Kaplan, Facebook vice president for United States public policy, said in an interview. \u201cThe ads and accounts we found appeared to amplify divisive political issues across the political spectrum,\u201d including gun rights, gay rights issues and the Black Lives Matter movement.The scope and types of the Facebook content being handed over underline the complicated nature of the investigation, and the degree to which the social network \u2014 home to more than two billion regular visitors \u2014 has been used to manipulate Americans and foment public unrest.In a live video address on his Facebook page last month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged the gravity and novelty of the tactics used across his network.\u201cMany of these dynamics were new in this election, or at much larger scale than ever before in history, and at much larger scale than the interference we\u2019ve found,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Since Facebook\u2019s public disclosures, the cross hairs have widened to encompass other companies in Silicon Valley and what part, if any, their networks had in shaping the 2016 election\u2019s outcome.Officials from all three companies have been asked to testify at public congressional hearings on the Russian operations before the House committee this month and the Senate committee on Nov. 1.While American intelligence agencies concluded in January that a major goal of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, was to damage Hillary Clinton, the Facebook operation shows the Russian government reached deeply into polarizing political issues on multiple fronts. Russia experts said Mr. Putin hoped to mar the image of American democracy and handicap the United States\u2019 international influence.In every case, the voices posed as Americans and presumed to speak for like-thinking fellow citizens: anti-immigration zealots, gun-rights advocates, gay rights supporters, African-American activists \u2014 and, more incongruously, dog lovers, according to the two people familiar with the sampling of advertisements.The LGBT United page and a Twitter account called @LGBTuni, featuring a rainbow symbol, declared: \u201cWe speak for all fellow members of LGBT community across the nation. Gender preference does not define you. Your spirit defines you.\u201dThe Defend the 2nd page appeared to have spread messages of support for gun rights.\u201cWhy do I have a gun?\u201d asks a young woman in one image that appears to be associated with the page. \u201cBecause it\u2019s easier for my family to get me out of jail than out of cemetery.\u201d (The image and slogan seem to be borrowed from real gun activists, but the dropped \u201ca\u201d before \u201ccemetery\u201d is a characteristic mistake for Russians speaking English.)Part of Facebook\u2019s challenge in rooting out bad actors speaks to the very nature of how the company\u2019s entire network is built. In some cases, the Russian-linked accounts created Facebook groups and posted images and content aimed to spread quickly across Facebook.To aid the viral spread, these accounts paid for \u201cboosted posts\u201d \u2014 Facebook\u2019s name for one of its paid advertisements \u2014 to appear interspersed in users\u2019 news feeds, the central column filled with status updates and photos from friends. Those posts often included a call to action, like asking users to join a bogus group or share the post.Moreover, the disinformation campaign spread well beyond Facebook to sites like Reddit, Instagram, 4chan and Imgur \u2014 other popular online social networks \u2014 making it more difficult for any one company to curb the tide of fake accounts.The Rev. Heber Brown III, pastor of a Baltimore church, asked Blacktivist if those behind the account were in Baltimore. The person or people behind the account responded that they were not but \u201cwe are looking for friendship, because we are fighting for the same reasons. Actually we are open for your thoughts and offers.\u201dMr. Brown replied that they should \u201ccome learn and listen before you lead\u201d and urged Blacktivist to apologize publicly. When he learned on Friday, first from a CNN report, that the account originated in Russia, Mr. Brown tweeted his amazement that he had not been correcting an overeager out-of-town activist but had unwittingly been \u201cdisrupting a Russian op.\u201dThe goal of the dog lovers\u2019 page was more obscure. But some analysts suggested a possible motive: to build a large following before gradually introducing political content. Without viewing the entire feed from the page, now closed by Facebook, it is impossible to say whether the Russian operators tried such tactics.Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent now at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, said Russia had been entrepreneurial in trying to develop diverse channels of influence. Some, like the dogs page, may have been created without a specific goal and held in reserve for future use.\u201cThey were creating many audiences on social media to try to influence around,\u201d said Mr. Watts, who has traced suspected Russian accounts since 2015.Facebook said it was taking steps to fight back. The company plans to hire more than 1,000 new employees for its ads review team, and said it would cooperate and share what it learned with other technology companies. It also plans to restrict \u201cmore subtle types of violence\u201d from appearing in ads, and will require more thorough documentation to verify the identities of advertisers who wish to buy political ads.On Saturday, at the conclusion of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur \u2014 the \u201cDay of Atonement\u201d \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg, who is Jewish, also appeared penitent.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Scott Shane from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "God Bless America", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cGod bless America,\u201d our president said, dutifully, after the bloody Sunday in Las Vegas. It\u2019s a wish worth repeating. It\u2019s an intervention sorely needed in a country seriously lost.God bless America, where shock over a torrent of bullets that sends dozens more to the morgue doesn\u2019t last, if indeed there\u2019s shock at all. This kind of violence is no longer exceptional. But we are. No other affluent country can match our massacres or, in the face of them, our paralysis. We stand out boldly in this regard. We lead.God bless America, awash in self-delusion. House Speaker Paul Ryan responded to the horror in Las Vegas by saying that \u201cwhat truly defines us\u201d are the acts of heroism we learned of, while the shooting itself \u201cis not who we are.\u201d How does he figure that? Las Vegas was one of the worst but hardly the first. And it demands more than the gauzy pieties and press-a-button platitudes that too many politicians spout.God bless America, where the fact that we can\u2019t be 100 percent sure that a given new gun restriction would lessen the dying becomes an excuse not to give it a try, though the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, the sirens couldn\u2019t be louder and each new marker surpasses the last.In Newtown, Conn., in 2012, 26 people perished, 20 of them children. In Orlando four years later, 49 died. And in Las Vegas, the count so far is 59. What\u2019s the trip wire for urgency and action? Triple digits?God bless America, where the Second Amendment seems to be getting a hell of a lot more respect right now than the First. It has become totemic, part of a larger culture war that blinds too many Americans to the amendment\u2019s conception in an entirely different era and context, long before the efficient killing machines of today. There\u2019s the right to bear arms, sure, but there\u2019s also the right to walk into a nightclub or a concert \u2014 or to send a child off to school \u2014 without a sense of dread that\u2019s increasingly and fully warranted. Aren\u2019t we entitled to that, too?God bless America, where we\u2019ve outsourced empathy and righteous anger from the White House to television talk shows and learned to lean on the comedians who host them. On Monday those jokesters seriously channeled our emotions and sounded the appropriate alarms. Politics and entertainment don\u2019t merely overlap. In the Trump era, they\u2019ve traded job descriptions.God bless America, with its sloppy ooze of agenda-driven misinformation. In the hours after the shooting, posts that erroneously identified the shooter and baselessly described him as a Trump-hating liberal or a recent convert to Islam gained serious traction on Google and Facebook, an echo of the fake news in the 2016 presidential election, an example of the conspiracy theories that so many Americans embrace and an illustration of the house of mirrors in which they now stumble around.God bless America, with our boundless talent and galling complacency. If we summon enough gratitude for the former to banish the latter, we just might find our way forward.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Open to Banning \u2018Bump Stocks\u2019 Used in Massacre", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a generation, Republicans in Congress \u2014 often joined by conservative Democrats \u2014 have bottled up gun legislation, even as the carnage of mass shootings grew ever more gruesome and the weaponry ever more deadly. A decade ago, they blocked efforts to limit the size of magazines after the massacre at Virginia Tech. Five years later, Republican leaders thwarted bipartisan legislation to expand background checks of gun purchasers after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Last year, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub massacre, they blocked legislation to stop gun sales to buyers on terrorism watch lists.\u201cI own a lot of guns, and as a hunter and sportsman, I think that\u2019s our right as Americans, but I don\u2019t understand the use of this bump stock,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said, adding, \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s an obvious area we ought to explore and see if it\u2019s something Congress needs to act on.\u201dMr. Cornyn said the continuing legality of the conversion kits was \u201ca legitimate question,\u201d and told reporters he had asked Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, to convene a hearing on that issue and any others that arise out of the Las Vegas investigation.Other Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, said they would be open to considering legislation on bump stocks.\u201cWe certainly want to learn more details on what occurred in Las Vegas,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, \u201cand if there are vulnerabilities in federal law that we should be addressing to prevent such attacks in the future, we would always be open to that.\u201dIn the House, Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, said he was drafting bipartisan legislation banning the conversion kits. Representative Mark Meadows, the head of the conservative Freedom Caucus, also said he would be open to considering a bill, while Representative Bill Flores, Republican of Texas, called for an outright ban.In an often deadlocked Washington, none of the pronouncements guaranteed action. The National Rifle Association, which has poured tens of millions of dollars into Republican campaign coffers, remained mum on the bump stock discussion and could stop it cold.And Erich Pratt, executive director of another gun rights group, Gun Owners of America, vowed to block any legislation.\u201cWe see this as an item that is certainly protected by the Second Amendment, and realistically, they are already on the market, so passing a law banning them isn\u2019t going to stop bad guys like this creep in Las Vegas,\u201d he said.But Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat, tried to force the issue, introducing legislation, backed by about two dozen Democrats, that would ban bump stocks.Ms. Feinstein cautioned that bipartisan support for such narrow legislation would hardly constitute a sea change. She tried to ban bump stocks in 2013, but that was part of broader legislation to renew the assault weapons ban, which went nowhere.\u201cI mean, if not this, what?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a weapon away. It just means you can\u2019t convert it into something it\u2019s not meant to be.\u201dAt a hastily convened news conference, Ms. Feinstein said the Las Vegas massacre, which left 58 people dead and about 500 injured at a country music festival Sunday night, had hit home with her. Her daughter had planned to attend the concert but decided against going at the last minute.\u201cBump stocks\u201d are attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster, almost like machine guns. Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.Ms. Feinstein, who has spent years shepherding gun safety legislation \u2014 almost always unsuccessfully \u2014 said she introduced the measure on the advice of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who reasoned that by offering a narrowly tailored provision, she might get Republican support.Bump stocks replace a rifle\u2019s standard stock, which is the part held against the shoulder, freeing the weapon to slide back and forth rapidly, harnessing the energy from the kickback that shooters feel when the weapon fires. The stock \u201cbumps\u201d back and forth between the shooter\u2019s shoulder and trigger finger, causing the rifle to rapidly fire again and again, far faster than an unaided finger can pull a trigger.The Las Vegas gunman fired down on concertgoers from the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel. With his fixed firing positions and distance from his victims, he almost certainly was more lethal because of the conversion kits. But until the shooting, many lawmakers said, they had never heard of bump stocks.The devices were introduced during the past decade by Bump Fire and Slide Fire, both based in Moran, Tex., near Abilene. Bump Fire\u2019s website appeared to be down for much of Wednesday. The company wrote on its Facebook page on Tuesday that its servers had been overwhelmed by \u201chigh traffic volume.\u201dMultiple items on Slide Fire\u2019s site on Wednesday featured the notice, \u201cDue to extreme high demands, we are currently out of stock.\u201dBump Fire sells stocks for an AK-47 and an AR-15 for $99.99 each. Slide Fire\u2019s stocks are priced between $140 and $300. Neither company responded to a request for comment.On Gunbroker.com, an auction site for firearms and shooting accessories, at least three dozen listings featuring bump stocks had attracted multiple bids.Zack Cernok, a Pennsylvania gun owner, was one of those trying to buy a Bump Fire bump stock.\u201cI don\u2019t even have the gun for it, but I want the stock just to have it down the line,\u201d he said. \u201cI just like the idea of them and want to see how it feels and if it\u2019s worth it \u2014 for $100, it\u2019s almost not a bad investment to buy it, try it out and sell it if I don\u2019t like it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Condolence Call to Soldier\u2019s Widow Ignites an Imbroglio", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s condolence call to the widow of a slain soldier exploded into a vicious row that swamped the White House on Wednesday, with the soldier\u2019s grieving mother accusing the president of disrespecting her family and a defiant Mr. Trump complaining that his words had been cynically twisted for political purposes.Mr. Trump angrily disputed that account, insisting that he \u201chad a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife, who sounded like a lovely woman.\u201d The White House accused the congresswoman, Frederica S. Wilson of Florida, of politicizing a sacred ritual after Mr. Trump initially said she \u201cfabricated\u201d it.It was, to a great extent, a self-inflicted wound. Mr. Trump opened the issue on Monday when he deflected a question about why he had not spoken publicly about the deaths of the four soldiers by falsely accusing his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of not contacting the families of fallen troops.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump dragged his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, into the dispute. He told reporters that Mr. Obama had not called Mr. Kelly, a former Marine Corps general, when his son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in action in 2010 in Afghanistan. Mr. Kelly, who has long been reluctant to talk about the loss of his son, did not comment on the issue.But the White House presented Mr. Kelly as a character witness on Wednesday, noting that he was present for Mr. Trump\u2019s call on Tuesday afternoon to Sergeant Johnson\u2019s wife, Myeshia Johnson, and viewed it as a respectful expression of presidential sympathies.\u201cHe thought that the president did the best job he could under those circumstances to offer condolences on behalf of the country,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. She said that Mr. Kelly is \u201cdisgusted by the way this has been politicized, and that the focus has become on the process and not the fact that American lives were lost.\u201dIt was Mr. Trump, however, who first put a spotlight on politics and process by comparing his practices with those of Mr. Obama and other presidents. Mr. Obama did, in fact, call or meet with the families of multiple fallen soldiers, though he sent letters to many others. Mr. Trump said he planned to call as many families of fallen soldiers as was \u201cappropriate.\u201dHis call to Ms. Johnson came as she and her two young children were in a limousine at Miami International Airport awaiting a plane carrying the remains of Sergeant Johnson. Mr. Trump spoke for three to five minutes, Ms. Wilson said.\u201cWhen she got off the phone, she said, \u2018He didn\u2019t even know his name. He kept calling him, \u2018Your guy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wilson said of Ms. Johnson. \u201cHe was calling the fallen soldier, \u2018Your guy.\u2019 And he never said his name because he did not know his name. So he kept saying, \u2018Your guy. Your guy. Your guy.\u2019 And that was devastating to her.\u201dMr. Trump flatly dismissed Ms. Wilson\u2019s account and suggested he would produce evidence to discredit it.Sergeant Johnson\u2019s mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, backed the congresswoman\u2019s version. \u201cYes, he did state that comment,\u201d Ms. Jones-Johnson said, via message on Facebook, of Mr. Trump\u2019s remark that her son \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201dBy midafternoon, the White House was no longer disputing Ms. Wilson\u2019s account of Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of words. Ms. Sanders said the White House did not tape the call. But she said Ms. Wilson had willfully mischaracterized the spirit of the conversation.\u201cThis is a president who loves our country very much, who has the greatest level of respect for men and women in uniform, and wanted to call and offer condolences to the family,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cTo try to create something from that, that the congresswoman is doing, is frankly appalling and disgusting.\u201dThe dispute over Mr. Trump\u2019s condolence call topped several contentious issues that marked yet another rancorous day at the White House.The president kept up his feud with the National Football League over players who take a knee in protest during the playing of the national anthem. And he revived his unproven charges that the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had lied, leaked information and protected Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent in last year\u2019s presidential election.But the way Mr. Trump has handled grieving military families loomed over all, and thrust the sensitive issue of how presidents deal with the casualties of war to center stage. His reference to Mr. Obama\u2019s lack of calls also drew furious responses from the former president\u2019s aides and expressions of discomfort from former military commanders.The feud with Sergeant Johnson\u2019s family was reminiscent of a public fight Mr. Trump began with the parents of a Muslim American soldier, Humayun Khan, who was killed in 2004 in Iraq. The soldier\u2019s parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, appeared at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, where Mr. Khan criticized Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s charged relationship with Gold Star families \u2014 those who have lost relatives in war \u2014 took another turn with the White House\u2019s disclosure on Wednesday that it had sent a check for $25,000 to the family of Sgt. Dillon Baldridge, who was shot to death by an Afghan police officer, along with two other American soldiers, in June.\u201cFor somebody to tell me they were going to give me something and then not come through, it feels like kicking me when I\u2019m down,\u201d Mr. Baldridge said Wednesday.Some experts sympathized with the challenge Mr. Trump faced in placing condolence calls.\u201cIt\u2019s always been difficult for presidents,\u201d said Peter D. Feaver, an expert in civilian-military relations at Duke University, \u201cbut in some ways, it\u2019s become more difficult as the number of casualties dwindled, so each one can be individualized to a much greater extent.\u201dOther calls Mr. Trump has made to families have been well received. The president called Eddie Lee, the father of First Lt. Weston C. Lee, who was killed in April by a roadside bomb in Iraq, and told him, \u201cI bet he never gave you a minute\u2019s trouble as a child.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Lee said, chuckling, \u201che didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThe president was just so nice and caring, you could hear it in his voice, you could tell what a caring family man he is,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who volunteered, \u201cI voted for Trump and I\u2019d vote for him again.\u201dBut the president\u2019s call to Sergeant Johnson\u2019s widow illustrated the pitfalls to his improvisational approach, according to other experts. Kori Schake, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University who specializes in civilian-military relations, said the account of Mr. Trump\u2019s call suggested he did not follow the \u201ctime-honored rituals\u201d of such calls.\u201cMy guess is that he thought he was showing respect for the toughness and patriotism of people who sacrifice for something bigger than themselves, and just did it clumsily,\u201d Ms. Schake said.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to Sgt. La David T. Johnson. He was serving in Africa with an Army Special Forces unit; he was not a Green Beret.Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting from Washington, and Jesse James DeConto from Zebulon, N.C.Advertisement"}

Administrators Need to Catch Up.", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusIs there a difference between \u201creal life\u201d and the digital realm?I\u2019ve heard parents and professors talk about these worlds as distinct, but for young people who have grown up with the internet, they are one and the same.One thing that hasn\u2019t been acknowledged enough is how the generation gap has been widened by rapid technological change, especially in regard to social media. The internet is integral to almost every aspect of the lives of young people. The social problems that unfold online are just as real to us as those that happen face to face.In college, this generational social media gap has become a source of misunderstanding and miscommunication between students and administrators. If a problem among students is playing out online, administrators may not know how to help for a number of reasons: They may see the problem as relegated to the digital realm. Or they may not know how the app or platform in question even works.I first became aware of this issue last November when black students at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am a junior, were targeted on a messaging app called GroupMe.GroupMe, it should be said, is a text client like WhatsApp that allows a user to be added to multiple group chats that vary in size from two to 200 members. A group chat over text message requires personal phone numbers or email addresses, but GroupMe is much easier: You can join or be added to different chats using a public Facebook or Google account.The key to the app\u2019s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.Last November, news of the \u201cMud Men\u201d chat spread like wildfire.There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn\u2019s black freshmen and in turn, Penn\u2019s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn\u2019s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.Don\u2019t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat\u2019s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It\u2019s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many. Online or real world: It\u2019s all the same.Najay Greenidge is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}

In the last few weeks alone, that means \u2014 like so many other people \u2014 I\u2019ve started the day with some of the most horrific news imaginable: a mass shooting, devastating storms, terrible wildfires. It\u2019s taken a toll on my overall well-being \u2014 and very likely yours, too.I\u2019ve been calling it \u201cthe bad news blues,\u201d which is just a general feeling of \u201chow much more of this can we all take\u201d whenever I see a stream of tragic news alerts hit my smartphone or social media feeds. Sure, it makes me want to help, but it also makes me sad. And overwhelmed. Dr. McNaughton-Cassill says that\u2019s a normal reaction when bad things are happening away from our own community, where we can do little to aid those in need. She said people might also experience an increase in stress, depression, exhaustion, sleep problems, anger and growing cynicism.For some people already prone to anxiety or clinical depression the toll can be even worse. \u201cThere are clear increases in anxiety disorders, including cutting and self-harm, and suicide rates,\u201d says Dr. Stephen Hinshaw, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThe barrage of ever-present \u2018bad news\u2019 \u2014 and, for young people, the barrage of social-media-related permanent records of negative social interchanges \u2014 is a factor.\u201dExperts say there are steps you can take to help fight the sadness and anxiety that all this bad news may be causing.\u201cIt\u2019s the repeated exposure that is the problem,\u201d Dr. Christina Mangurian, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in an email. Going without your smartphone can trigger a burst of the stress hormone cortisol and induce a fight-or-flight response that only settles down by checking it again. Still, you have to start somewhere. \u201cI suggest limiting the alerts and turning off phones a couple of hours before bed,\u201d Dr. Mangurian advises.Experts say recharging your smartphone in another part of the house overnight can help, as well as setting time limits around news and social media check-ins. Dr. McNaughton-Cassill recommends logging a day or two of online activity, in the same way people who are trying to lose weight might write down everything they eat. Apps like RescueTime can help you get a clear picture of your online life, including how much time you check your newsfeeds. It can also temporarily block websites that may be contributing to the problem. \u201cI talk about this in my clinical practice all the time,\u201d said Dr. McNaughton-Cassill. \u201cIt\u2019s basically cognitive behavioral therapy, the idea that people can think differently about the same event. So, if you only focus on the negative, you\u2019re going to feel bad. Look for a silver lining, and try to find something positive to focus on, such as all the people who have helped others during crisis events.\u201dThe half-dozen doctors and mental health experts I talked with for this article all emphasized the importance of self care over the latest news updates. \u201cSelf care implies that I cannot absorb all of the horrible things happening in this world 24 hours a day,\u201d says Dr. McNaughton-Cassill. \u201cI have to find a way to step back.

{"Headline": "Columbus, the Dove Ad and Redesigning Work Spaces: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationUpdated: Oct. 13It is tempting for young people like me to support independence movements like the one highlighted recently in Catalonia. We are often seduced by the narrative of the righteous underdog, and who better represents this than a stateless people attacked by their government for striving for their freedom? And while I, too, tend to sympathize with such movements, this time I am unconvinced, for a specific reason: I understand the difference between self-determination and ethnic nationalism, and Catalan independence is an expression of the latter.Self-determination is manifested as the right of a minority group to be free from oppression from the rest of their country. In this it opposes ethnically-motivated violence. If Catalonia was working toward independence because it was suppressed by the Spanish government, it would be rightfully seeking the right to self-determination. However, this is not the case: Catalan separatists aspire for statehood because of their ethnic identity, which they see as different from the rest of Spain. They do not claim victimization, but superiority, and thus those who support them affirm the legitimacy of ethnically-defined countries, which have been some of the greatest sources of oppression in modern history and are, in fact, what the principle of self-determination was made to protect against. The Catalans certainly have a right not to be discriminated against, but the nationalistic nature of the separatist campaign is not encouraging._________Many commenters wrote that the United States should continue to celebrate Columbus Day but should also establish a holiday to acknowledge indigenous peoples.When I heard that several cities have scrapped Columbus statues and turned its back on the greatest explorer of all time, I was crestfallen. As an Italian American, I have always looked up to Columbus as a hero. When he set sail in 1492, he could barely find enough sailors to man his ships and many doubted that the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria would never return. At a time when an overwhelming majority of people believed that it was possible to fall off the face of the Earth, Columbus challenged this notion. His incredible bravery, courage, and his faith in God are worthy of the praise and admiration of all.Of course, nobody is denying that Europeans decimated native populations. These horrific, genocidal crimes are inexcusable and should never be forgotten. Thus, I am all for establishing an Indigenous People\u2019s Day. But to establish this holiday as a replacement to Columbus Day is despicable. To stomp all over a figure who means so much to the Italian American community, and has been an inspiration to millions of Italian immigrants who struggled to find their place in society in the midst of persecution and poverty is unacceptable and a slap in the face to Italian Americans. Thus, we must continue celebrate one of America\u2019s oldest and most beloved holidays.Even though Columbus treated the natives badly and started the path to their destruction, he also did discover America for the Europeans, which is very important historically, especially for us, living in the US. People have always been conquering and taking over, and the natives probably did to each other. I think that Columbus day should stay, but it would be a good idea to have an Indigenous People\u2019s Day too, so that we can remember both sides and debate.How should Columbus be celebrated in our country for being the spark that causes scandals and disease to take away land from those who were born and raised in it? He really shouldn\u2019t, but due to his crew, not him, we are the way we are today and I am able to write this comment. I agree with the Indigenous People\u2019s Day because it would allow us to show gratitude to the real Americans and spend more time learning about their heritage in this country. Columbus had no intention of coming here and never truly did, but his discovery caused Italian-Americans to strip the Natives land from them and started up what would become a new society. I don\u2019t think that we should forget about Columbus altogether, but we need to focus on the facts and events to teach people of this age and the years to come how we can make this country better by letting diversity flow.Quite a few commenters believed strongly that Columbus\u2019s legacy should not be commemorated because of his mistreatment of indigenous peoples.Columbus never set foot on the actual Continental US, so there is no use in giving him that credit. Why should we celebrate a holiday that symbolizes the discovery of our country, when our country wasn\u2019t even discovered on that day? Also, consider the fact that after the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria (Columbus\u2019 ships) arrived, there was even more enslavement of the Native Americans. It isn\u2019t right to celebrate the day that caused more wrong slavery of the first peoples. Columbus, even if it was unintentional, was a genocidal man, and few, if anyone, can come up with a valid reason why he should be appreciated widely.I think Christopher Columbus Day should NOT be celebrated. Why should we teach the youth, or anyone to celebrate a man who found something that was never lost. It\u2019s goes against everything that American people believe in. The Indigenous people were mistreated all because a man decided that he wanted to take over land that did not belong to him. It\u2019s not fair to take credit of someone else\u2019s work, therefore Christoper Columbus Day should not be celebrated. He did not discover America... he mistreated the people already living in America.Considering Columbus committed genocide, he should not have a national holiday named after him. Using extreme violence to enslave an ethnicity should not be celebrated. Renaming the holiday to Indigenous People\u2019s Day would be appropriate because it could serve as a tribute to the many Natives who were killed unjustly.Columbus day commemorates the arrival to Christopher Columbus to America. He did many bad things to the indigenes of America and gave bad time for the natives. He killed, destroyed and took land from the indigenes. Why celebrate a day for all this barbarism? If we want to celebrate and remember history, we should think in the natives who died fighting for their rights, land, families, and believes._________After several commenters pointed out that the Facebook screenshot provided by The Times did not display the entire ad, which the advertiser had removed, we corrected our work and linked to a news report that showed the original. Many responded to the difference in seeing only the screenshot here vs. seeing the entire ad:This ad isn\u2019t racist since the Dove company wasn\u2019t trying to deliver the same message that society has conveyed it as. While the still picture of the black woman transforming into a white woman might enrage some, if people had seen the full ad, they would learn that the white woman would later take off her shirt and change into a Hispanic woman. Dove was only trying to show how all races could use their soap and their support for diversity.The fact that social media has literally cut a third of the ad out in order to push this narrative is indication enough that it\u2019s not racist in context, only out of context. This may make it tone-deaf, but clearly no offense was intended. That said, I try to understand positions different from mine, and do think someone in Marketing should have noticed the potential to offend.When i first saw this ad, I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. I saw it for what it was, an ad displaying the diversity of a client pool. No, this ad is not racially insensitive. I would say instead that people have become racially sensitive. This is partially a good thing. It means we\u2019ve come to a place where we can support each other in the little thing. Emphasis on little things because this ad is not as big a deal as people made it out to be... If she took off the shirt to reveal an asian woman, would things be the same and if that asian woman was the one that revealed the white woman, would there still be outrage. Probably not. Honestly there are better things to worry about other than Dove ads. You want to worry about racism? look outside of your facebook ad feed and worry about the people next to you.This ad is absolutely racist in showing that once one showers with Dove, that person can become \u201cclean,\u201d or in this case, become white. This implies that white people are \u201cclean,\u201d and colored people should strive to become \u201cclean,\u201d or white. It advertises that one can become white in using their product, where being white has a positive connotation, and being black has a negative connotation. Even if the Dove company were striving to show diversity, the fact that only African American, Caucasion, and Hispanic women were portrayed in this ad shows that they did not fully represent the diversity in America. If they were to show diversity, they should include others as well. The other races were incredibly misrepresented in this ad.I think that this ad is, in fact, very racist. It is implying that dark-skinned women are \u201cimpure\u201d and that they should use Dove soap to become whiter, and thus \u201cpurer.\u201d If companies make such tone-deaf ads like this one, the best response to the outcries would be to apologize for the misconception and mistake, and then tweak the ad to have a much more positive message. I also believe that there is no way to avoid such misconceptions until the ad is released to the public. Many people would not think of such racist interpretations until others notify them of it. This is completely not acceptable, in my personal opinion.Ok, but now for the big marketing question: would this short GIF have ever worked? My answer is no:White, colored, colored: \u2018whites always get first place\u2019Colored, white, colored: \u2018ah the white woman is the cleaner version of the colored woman, that\u2019s racist\u2019Colored, colored, white: \u2018ah the white woman is the cleanest version of the colored women, that\u2019s racist\u2019They should have never released this short gif, but stuck to the longer video with 7 women. Even then they would have received critical reviews..because people are racially sensitive...but that would have somewhat saved it, in my opinion._________This school building design is an improvement to not only to schools but also the workplace and real world. It creates a less structured environment that is applicable to real life. In some work offices they have started to have stand up desks which is a small step toward the direction of this completely modified work space. I love the idea of having an individual space as well as a collaborative space. I think that this should be expanded even more into a more outside environment for some students or employees to work. Having outside offices would increase health as well as productivity for the majority of people. The hard thing with implying this in high school is it would need a lot more supervision than having normal classrooms. I also believe that students would have more motivation to get their work done in this creative self chosen atmosphere.I feel one of the components that most schools lack is outdoor availability. Having a place where you can do schoolwork outside would benefit me in a major way. I like to feel connected to the world and relaxed when doing schoolwork, and by being in a relaxed environment, I can focus and work more efficiently. Collaboration is an important aspect of school because it teaches you to work with people and it applies to your life outside of school as well. Having an area where students can collaborate is a significant factor to an efficient school environment. Aside from working together, it is also important to work alone. Rooms or spaces that students will not be distracted would help increase focus. A productive school environment would have designated places to do so.I am a listener. I make small talk- which expands into much deeper conversation and interests- and observe the things the other person states finding myself generalizing my thoughts on that person\u2019s values. My goal is to keep the conversation going without the awkward pauses where you just stare each other dead in the eye. Unfortunately, that\u2019s normal and most likely going to occur. I say things that relate to the other person to get them to share more about themselves. I like to hear what they have to say and take in their new stories. While sharing your own stories is exciting, you already know what\u2019s going to happen. Also, most people enjoy talking about themselves as that is the one topic they know everything about.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Ways to Protect Yourself Against Unexpected Wedding Catastrophe", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor most couples, wedding planning begins at least a year in advance, and typically starts with booking the perfect venue. While many of the preparations can be controlled \u2014 the menu, flowers and guest list \u2014 sometimes things can go terribly wrong.There are some ways to protect yourself when you have booked so far in advance and the unforeseen happens.All deposits should be made via credit card, so the credit card company can lobby on your behalf. Never wire funds. That\u2019s true when it comes to paying any final balances, too. Then if, say, the baker who is supposed to create you a wedding cake goes out of business days before the wedding or the florist forgets to bring flowers to your reception, you don\u2019t have to hassle with the small business owner. If they refuse to reimburse your money or stop picking up their phone, credit card companies can help you fight.Larger hotel chains, like Marriott or the Four Seasons Resorts, will typically refund any deposits in a disaster, but smaller businesses may not have funds to recoup. \u201cIf you book at a smaller hotel or bed-and-breakfast and they\u2019re wiped out, whatever deposit you wired them is going to be very difficult to get back,\u201d Ms. Gregoli said.Weddings today can be as expensive as a car, sometimes even more, so protect your investment. Purchase wedding insurance. It isn\u2019t very expensive, Ms. Gregoli said, but it may protect against any unexpected events. It starts at about $150 for a basic policy, but rates go up based on such things as location, the number of guests and whether the event is inside or outside in a tent. The total cost of the wedding will also affect the rate: A $10,000 even is going to carry a lower premium than one costing $150,000.Insurance can offer peace of mind. For example, if the space you booked for your wedding is destroyed by a hurricane or fire, a good insurance policy will cover the costs of rescheduling and reimburse you for any lost deposits. (It will even cover things like losing the rings before the wedding or if a bride\u2019s gown is lost in baggage.)If there is an extreme event \u2014 an act of terrorism, say, something weather-related, or a fire \u2014 don\u2019t rely on hotel wedding planners. Often, the general manager will have clearer answers, Ms. Gregoli said.One month after Hurricane Maria passed over Anguilla, Ms. Gregoli and one of her couples had a conference call with the general manager at a resort on the island. They needed to know specifics about the damage: Is it landscaping and trees that were hardest hit \u2014 or is there structural damage? Would the ferry dock be rebuilt in time to accept guests? Lucky for this particular bride and groom, the general manager confirmed all repairs would be finished for their June 2018 nuptials. But another one of Ms. Gregoli\u2019s clients, whose wedding was booked in December at the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands, wasn\u2019t as fortuitous. That couple had to reschedule for the following year.Read contracts carefully. In an extreme event, what is the wedding site\u2019s obligation to keep you informed?\u201cIt\u2019s a big revenue hit, that\u2019s undeniable,\u201d Ms. Byck-Barwick said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be back up and running. I feel so much more pain for everyone who lost their homes.\u201dHave an alternate plan. If you can\u2019t make it to your destination is there somewhere you can marry locally?\u201cI was researching the best respiratory masks to buy for our guests and vendors,\u201d said Ms. Soleimani, 32, a corporate communications manager at Google.org. \u201cWe were starting to realize that the idea of celebrating in Napa, when all of this was going on, just didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d (The couple is quick to point out that their original venue and vendors offered full refunds, nearly across the board.)\u201cWe\u2019re making major cuts to our normal rates,\u201d said Phil Spiegel, the executive vice president of Merchants Exchange Productions, which runs the ballroom. \u201cThis is our way of helping.\u201d The ballroom hosted two displaced weddings last weekend and is currently taking inquiries from wine country couples for the weeks and months ahead.Advertisement"}

Why?\u2022 Were there any surprises? Anything that challenged what you know \u2014 or thought you knew?\u2022 What messages, emotions or ideas will you take away from this film? Why?\u2022 What questions do you still have?I began making this film in 2015, aiming to upend the prevailing narrative of conflict in Sudan by showing so-called victims defy two strongmen at the helm of the conflict. In an age of ascendant nationalism, it is also an example of how people use comedy to deal with authoritarian rule, no matter where they are.I met this film\u2019s protagonist, Ganja, in 2015 during my first visit to the Nuba Mountains of Sudan. I had traveled to the rebel-held capital of Kauda to train journalists, but was soon distracted by the making of an episode of \u201cBisha TV,\u201d a satirical puppet show that mocked the Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir and his cronies.The writers, a mix of journalists and members of a drama group, met in the shade of a great mango tree. Fueled by sweet tea, they churned out scripts. Curious villagers gathered around the set during the first days of filming. When the crew unwrapped the puppets, the crowd collectively screamed. Children tripped over one another as they ran from an effigy of the president responsible for tormenting them. But the puppets, handmade in South Africa, were not designed to sustain Nuba\u2019s heat, and the autocrats\u2019 heads began to melt. The theater of the absurd continued like this both on and off camera.\u201cBisha TV\u201d followed the lead of two other popular satirical African puppet shows: Kenya\u2019s \u201cXYZ Show\u201d and South Africa\u2019s \u201cZanews.\u201d Both programs upset politicians and struggled to find broadcasters, but \u201cBisha TV\u201d debuted in a far more hostile and restricted media climate. Journalists are regularly imprisoned and tortured in Sudan for reporting on wars and human rights abuses. Sudan is so rived by the conflict that news of these atrocities in the Nuba Mountains, Darfur and Blue Nile rarely reaches Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum. While making this film, I took a surreal trip to Khartoum, where I met Sudanese who told me their country was at peace._________More?\u2022 Our next Film Club will take place on Friday, Oct. 27.Advertisement"}

Alphabet is interested in a lot of tech that will change the physical world around us, from self-driving cars to robots. This is a way to see how all that stuff will play out in the real world and, even better, to get city officials involved in the planning. That\u2019s better than moving fast and breaking things.The move ratchets up the stakes in the cutthroat world of ride hailing. Uber is working on its own $1 billion deal \u2014 this one with SoftBank \u2014 while automakers and other start-ups look on warily at the state of play.Isn\u2019t it funny that just one year ago Lyft was all but dead in the court of public opinion?

Usually bigger companies have advantages that lead to better products. Amazon, for instance, has greater selection and faster shipping times than any other online retailer, while Facebook has all your friends and family. The ride-hailing business doesn\u2019t seem to have those dynamics \u2014 Uber is far bigger than Lyft, but that size is not evident to customers in any way. Which seems bad for Uber, in the long run.This burns me up. As Facebook continues to say, over and over, that it wants to be as transparent as possible, it neglects the fact that it has fought against external oversight of how its platform worked for years. And on Nov. 1, when Facebook and others are called to testify in the Senate and House, it\u2019s likely that the C.E.O.s or C.O.O.s of these companies won\u2019t even show up to explain what happened.That\u2019s an enormous cop-out in my book.

{"Headline": "No Manifesto, No Phone Calls: Las Vegas Killer Left Only Cryptic Clues", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn one mass shooting after another, gunmen have offered telling evidence of their motives: complaining of \u201cbaby parts\u201d after a shooting at Planned Parenthood, sympathizing with the Islamic State with a Facebook post on the day of the San Bernardino shooting, asking members of Congress if they were Republicans before pulling the trigger at a congressional baseball practice.\u201cIn the spirit of the safety of this community or anywhere else in the United States I think it\u2019s important to provide that information, but I don\u2019t have it,\u201d Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in an interview Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know it yet.\u201dNo grandiose manifesto has been found. No account of Mr. Paddock behaving dangerously or holding extremist views has emerged from neighbors or relatives. Unlike past killers, Mr. Paddock did not dial up the police to explain his actions.The F.B.I. took Mr. Paddock\u2019s computers and cellphones to its laboratory in Quantico, Va., for review, law enforcement officials said. Agents interviewed his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, in an attempt to determine his mental state at the time of the shooting, but Sheriff Lombardo said he was \u201cnot at liberty to say\u201d what information had been learned.Of course, investigators could at any time come across evidence that reveals Mr. Paddock\u2019s thinking. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident we\u2019ll get there,\u201d Sheriff Lombardo said.Agents have fanned out across the country, interviewing family members and friends and looking for signs of mental illness.Mr. Paddock left a trail of clues that are, so far, more cryptic than revealing: There was a note in his hotel room whose exact contents the authorities have yet to reveal. Sheriff Lombardo said that it contained numbers that were being analyzed for their relevance, and that it was not a manifesto or suicide note.Mr. Paddock may have scouted other locations, including Fenway Park in Boston, Lollapalooza in Chicago and the Life is Beautiful music festival in Las Vegas, before finally checking into a suite at the Mandalay Bay that had clear sight lines to Route 91, and a massive gathering of country music fans. He stockpiled expensive firearms over the course of many months.His suite held more than 20 guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.Investigators have identified 47 firearms belonging to Mr. Paddock, including a dozen in his hotel suite that were enhanced to fire at an accelerated rate, and discovered a system of cameras Mr. Paddock set up to monitor the area around his location.Mr. Paddock struck a jet fuel tank near McCarran International Airport with two rifle rounds, said Chris Jones, an airport spokesman, though a police official expressed doubt that he targeted it intentionally.Despite the huge scale of the attack, why Mr. Paddock carried it out remained a huge and haunting question mark, said Steven B. Wolfson, the district attorney in Clark County, Nev., where the killings occurred. He estimated that in \u201c99 percent of the cases,\u201d the perpetrator of a drastic killing offers some kind of justification, however twisted.\u201cMost of the time, you don\u2019t defend it, you don\u2019t accept it, but you hear the why,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said in an interview on Thursday.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time and I can\u2019t remember another homicide \u2014 and then you multiply what I\u2019m about to say by 58 \u2014 where you don\u2019t know why.\u201dHad Mr. Paddock been taken into custody \u201cmaybe we would have found out why,\u201d Mr. Wolfson added. \u201cMaybe he would have said, \u2018this is the reason why I did it.\u2019 But because he killed himself, we don\u2019t know and it\u2019s frustrating.\u201dKatherine W. Schweit, a former senior F.B.I. official, co-wrote a lengthy 2013 F.B.I. study that looked at 160 mass shootings in the United States. The study did not specifically examine motivation, but Ms. Schweit said many of the underlying reasons for the shootings were apparent to investigators. \u201cA jilted lover, race or religion, someone who was fired,\u201d she said. \u201cOther times the motive is more elusive. This isn\u2019t the first guy who seemed to have found a target for his anger who we can\u2019t understand where the anger came from. Anger manifests itself in a lot of different ways.\u201d\u201cI think everyone wants an answer because they are grasping to understand the senselessness of the shooting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt reminds me exactly of the conversations we had after 9/11.\u201dExperts and law enforcement veterans caution that it can take time to establish a killer\u2019s real motivations, piecing together electronic data with interviews and other shards of a life twisted into extreme violence.Officials involved in the Las Vegas investigation have said they expect it will take an exhaustive search into Mr. Paddock\u2019s past, spanning multiple states and decades of his life, to deduce what brought him to the windows of the Mandalay Bay hotel with such an elaborate plan for murder. In F.B.I. speak, they want to understand his \u201cpathway to violence.\u201dAndrew Bringuel, a former member of the F.B.I.\u2019s behavioral analysis unit, said investigators were undoubtedly exploring a range of motives that include personal, economic, social or political.\u201cHe could have been seeking revenge,\u201d said Mr. Bringuel, who retired earlier this year. \u201cThis could have been a personal grievance. He could have been a sore loser. Gamblers like to talk about their winnings, but not their losses. I worked for the F.B.I. for a long time. The F.B.I. is pretty good at looking at the nooks and crannies of someone\u2019s life. The bureau will end up with a hypothesis. Whether the bureau can prove it is a separate question.\u201dFifty-eight people were killed in the Las Vegas massacre. The same number were killed by gun violence in 28 days in Chicago.Mr. Paddock would appear, in several respects, to be an unlikely perpetrator: An affluent man in his seventh decade, Mr. Paddock was both older and wealthier than the typical mass murderer, who is usually a young and isolated white man, often with a history of violence or mental problems.\u201cHe was able to plan this, to do this,\u201d Eric Paddock said. \u201cThat is the person Steve was.\u201d\u201cThis one is somewhat different than many of the ones we\u2019ve dealt with in the past,\u201d Mr. McCabe said of the Las Vegas attack, on CNBC, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have any immediately accessible thumbprints that would indicate the shooter\u2019s ideology or motivation.\u201dMr. Paddock, he said, was \u201cnot on our radar, or anyone\u2019s radar, prior to the event.\u201dMany killers, however, are unknown to law enforcement before their attacks, and some experts caution that the mystery around Mr. Paddock may be less aberrational that it seems. A number of massacres in recent decades have gone largely or completely unexplained.Other attacks have taken months to explain in depth, like the killing of 12 people at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in July 2012.Still, Mr. Brauchler said, his office had meaningful clues about Mr. Holmes\u2019s mind-set within days of the shooting, including information about a breakup with his girlfriend. The Las Vegas case was plainly different, he said.\u201cThe scariest part of this,\u201d Mr. Brauchler said, \u201cis to not find or know a motive.\u201d\u201cIn a lot of cases, even when they give a motive, what they\u2019re saying is for public effect,\u201d Mr. Lankford said, \u201cnot necessarily the true explanation behind their actions.\u201dAn article on Friday about Stephen Paddock\u2019s uncertain motive for killing 58 people in Las Vegas misstated the circumstances of the death of Charles Whitman, the gunman in the 1966 University of Texas massacre. He was killed by the police; he did not kill himself.Reporting was contributed by William K. Rashbaum from New York, Mitch Smith and Sabrina Tavernise from Las Vegas, and Rebecca R.

{"Headline": "From Crozes-Hermitage, an Extra Dimension After Delicious", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolSome wines are simply full of pleasure, delicious to drink and no more than that. Other wines are just as enjoyable, with the addition of an extra dimension that speaks of place and heritage.Here at Wine School, we love and appreciate the first kind, but we live for the second. These wines of place are transcendent. They lift wine from the category of complex and pleasing beverage to the level of cultural expression.In the last month, in which we have been drinking Crozes-Hermitage from the northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley of France, we found both sorts of wines, and another that was somewhere in between. Together, they offered some of the best articulations of Crozes-Hermitage, an appellation that has not always gotten much respect, but maybe has not always earned it, either.As with much of the northern Rh\u00f4ne, Crozes-Hermitage was once a polyculture where grapevines were simply part of the local crop. It was at one time a prime spot for growing cherries and apricots. But as wine came to be more lucrative than fruit over the last third of the 20th century, many of the acres devoted to table fruit were given over to wine grapes.This was not necessarily in the best interest of the wine. Many vines have been planted in loamy, fertile soils that were better for table fruits than for nuanced wines. As a result, perhaps, Crozes-Hermitage became known both for easygoing, modestly interesting wines as well as for bottles in which flashy expressions of the winemaker\u2019s hand, like flavors of new oak, were more evident than characteristics of the place.The Equinoxe \u2014 made by Maxime Graillot, the son of Alain Graillot \u2014 was a joy to drink. Ripe, fruity and savory, with flavors of black olives, pepper and roasted meats, it showed many of the characteristics I love about syrah wines from the northern Rh\u00f4ne. But that was about the extent of it.I would categorize it as a wine that expresses the characteristics of the grape more than the place itself. Its character helps to locate it within that general region, but it lacked the nuances that might have allowed an experienced Rh\u00f4ne drinker to pin it down to a more particular place.Alain Graillot\u2019s Crozes offers similar flavors. It, too, is delicious, with flavors of roasted meats, black peppers and olives. But where the Equinoxe was soft, easy and exuberant, the Graillot was smoothly structured. It was also floral and starkly mineral, with earthy, stony elements. I found the wine lovely, compelling and thoughtful. It\u2019s also $35 rather than $21.This is a wine that for me most definitely speaks of a place. It doesn\u2019t have the elegance and persistence of C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie or the power of Hermitage, but that helps to let you know it is not from one of the elite terroirs of the region. That is not a knock; it is only rarely an occasion worthy of one of those wines, which to me makes everyday bottles all the more important.I found it fascinating to compare these two wines, which most likely were overseen by the same man, Maxime Graillot, who has taken over some of the winemaking duties at his father\u2019s estate. Yet the grapes come from different places and the winemaking techniques are different. Most notably, the grapes for the Equinoxe were destemmed before fermentation, while the grapes for the Graillot were not.This decision seems to have particular cultural significance in the northern Rh\u00f4ne, where the question of whether to destem can shape the character of a wine in a less subtle way than in, say, Burgundy.Destemming is a more modern technique, as it depends on the technology for automating the destemming process, which otherwise would be laborious. It tends to enhance the fruitiness of the wine. Fermenting the wine with the stems tends to produce more savory elements as well as more tannins, for a more structured wine.\u201cGod made grapes with stems for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives the wine long life and energy. Besides, I didn\u2019t want to pay for a destemming machine.\u201dThe grapes for the Alain Graillot come from his vineyard on the plain in Crozes-Hermitage, near the hamlet of Les Ch\u00eanes Verts. Ordinarily, I would imagine the grapes from this area have less potential than those from the few granite hillside vineyards in Crozes-Hermitage. But the vineyard \u2014 unusually for the region, Mr. Graillot once told me \u2014 is set in a stony, sandy ancient riverbed, which perhaps adds to the character of the grapes.The Equinoxe is Maxime Graillot\u2019s n\u00e9gociant line of wines, meaning he buys the grapes. They come from vineyards near the Graillot family estate, from the commune of Beaumont-Monteux, and I believe the soils are somewhat similar. The main differences seem to be the destemming, and the intent to make an easy-drinking wine rather than a wine that ought to age and improve for a decade.For me, the Sil\u00e8ne occupied a middle ground between the two other wines. It had that extra dimension of place that set it apart from the easygoing Equinoxe, but not to the extent of the Graillot. Nonetheless, I would still consider it a wine of place.Each of these Crozes producers also makes an equivalent bottling of St.-Joseph, and it would be illuminating to make some fresh comparisons. Extra credit, anybody?Not every wine has that extra dimension, and plenty of wines that do not can be satisfying. But finding a wine that speaks so directly to you is the great reward of exploration.Advertisement"}

But most Americans know them only as part of the backdrop for the planet of the Wookiees in \u201cStar Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith.\u201dAnd Guilin mi fen (rice noodles) \u2014 for which the city is as famed as for its beauty \u2014 are still a rarity in New York. Taste of Guilin in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, serves them hot and quick; so did, briefly, a now-shuttered storefront in Flushing, Queens.When the bowl lands on the table, all that is visible is a crowded topography of deep-fried soybeans, ready to cave in with a crunch that echoes in the skull; clips of pickled long beans shining and sour from a wallow in vinegar; and chile flakes, scallion and torn cilantro, looking as if they were flung to the winds. Thin panels of long-stewed beef, agreeably pliant, overlap pork belly cut like bacon and thrust under the broiler until the edges are somehow crisp and chewy at once.The noodles wait below, as thick as spaghetti, slippery but still springy. At the very bottom is the \u201csecret\u201d sauce. Once churned with the other ingredients \u2014 \u201cmix many times,\u201d the waitress instructed gravely one evening \u2014 it takes possession.Its base is a broth of pork and beef, both bones and meat, simmered for eight hours for lushness. Fermented bean curd gives it a salty tang, tempered by the sweetness of star anise, licorice root and dried luo han guo, a small gourd known in the West as monk fruit (and a sugar substitute) and native to Guangxi. A whiff of lemongrass nods to Guangxi\u2019s neighbor across the border, Vietnam. Other spices and herbs must remain nameless.In Guilin, the dish is often eaten at bare-bones shops while you are half-crouched on tiny stools, the noodles heaped in metal bowls with nothing but meat and sauce. Everything else (pickles, chile, herbs) is a condiment, for diners to calibrate as they wish. Soup, too, may be added, ladled from a communal pot or poured from a tap. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of self-serve,\u201d Mr. Ding said.The rest of the menu is mostly peripheral, apart from cucumber rinsed in black vinegar and vegetable dumplings with a surprise of crunchy taro, a tribute to the taro-growing Lipu county in Guangxi. Loveliest is a mochi ball with a snow of coconut and, hidden within, red bean paste \u2014 no more than a thumbprint\u2019s worth, and just enough.Mr. Ding offers a few variants on traditional Guilin mi fen, including a gloss of truffle oil, which brings a faint perfume and extra weight on the tongue: interesting, but unnecessary. Elsewhere the noodles, imported from China, recur in a hearty, straightforward hot-and-sour beef soup flaring with chile oil and black bean paste, and mired alongside the enormous Shanghainese meatballs called lion\u2019s heads, in what seems less a soup than a sweet glaze.Better is lao you fen, translated here as \u201cold-buddy style\u201d noodles, street food from Mr. Ding\u2019s hometown, Nanning. The broth is clear but has a powerful, soul-deep funk, leaching from fermented bamboo shoots. Below are cakes of ground pork laced with rice wine. Stories of the dish\u2019s origins vary \u2014 a favorite tea shop, a swim in the river \u2014 but boil down to this: A friend falls ill. Soup restores him to life.I believe it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Campaign Got Early Word Russia Had Democrats\u2019 Emails", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The guilty plea of a 30-year-old campaign aide \u2014 so green that he listed Model United Nations in his qualifications \u2014 shifted the narrative on Monday of the Trump campaign\u2019s interactions with Russia: Court documents revealed that Russian officials alerted the campaign, through an intermediary in April 2016, that they possessed thousands of Democratic emails and other \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton.That was two months before the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee was publicly revealed and the stolen emails began to appear online. The new court filings provided the first clear evidence that Trump campaign aides had early knowledge that Russia had stolen confidential documents on Mrs. Clinton and the committee, a tempting trove in a close presidential contest.By the time of a crucial meeting in June of last year, when Donald Trump Jr. and other senior Trump campaign officials met with a Russian lawyer offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, some may have known for weeks that Russia had material likely obtained by illegal hacking, the new documents suggested. The disclosures added to the evidence pointing to attempts at collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, but they appeared to fall short of proof that they conspired in the hacking or other illegal acts.The improbable figure at the center of the new information was a \u201cforeign policy adviser\u201d to Mr. Trump, George Papadopoulos. It was Mr. Papadopoulos, one of three men whose charges were announced on Monday, who appears to have been the first campaign aide to learn about the Russian hacking of Democratic targets.A crucial detail is still missing: Whether and when Mr. Papadopoulos told senior Trump campaign officials about Russia\u2019s possession of hacked emails. And it appears that the young aide\u2019s quest for a deeper connection with Russian officials, while he aggressively pursued it, led nowhere.Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly promoted the idea of a \u201chistory making\u201d meeting between Mr. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. Senior campaign officials, however, said that Mr. Trump should not make the trip and leave it to someone \u201clow level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,\u2019\u2019 according to an email cited in court documents.Mr. Papadopoulos then proposed that he himself, perhaps with another campaign official, travel to Moscow to meet with the Russians.\u201cThe trip proposed by defendant PAPADOPOULOS did not take place,\u201d prosecutors wrote.To grasp the significance of Monday\u2019s developments, it helps to recall exactly how the Russian attack unfolded.In September 2015, the F.B.I. made its first call to the Democratic National Committee to report evidence of Russian hackers inside the committee\u2019s network. But for seven months, the word never got beyond an I.T. contractor, and the hackers apparently had the run of confidential emails and other files.During that time, Mr. Trump was pressed to assemble a team of foreign policy advisers, a difficult task because he was shunned by many Republicans who had served in earlier administrations. In early March, Mr. Papadopoulos, who had been helping the beleaguered campaign of Dr. Ben Carson, offered his services to the Trump campaign.Around March 6, documents say, a campaign supervisor \u2013 identified by a former Trump adviser as Sam Clovis \u2013 told Mr. Papadopoulos, then living in London, that \u201ca principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved relationship with Russia.\u201dA week later, traveling in Italy, Mr. Papadopoulos encountered a London-based professor of international relations, Joseph Mifsud, who claimed to have \u201csubstantial connections with Russian government officials.\u201d (The court documents do not name Mr. Mifsud, but a Senate aide briefed on the case identified him as the professor in question.)Unimpressed by Mr. Papadopoulos at first, Mr. Mifsud became far more interested when he learned that the young traveler was working for the Trump campaign. The two men met again in London on March 24, when the professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to a Russian woman he said was a relative of Mr. Putin with close ties to senior Russian officials.The same week, Mr. Trump, visiting The Washington Post, was pressed to name his foreign policy team. He read out five names, most of them with modest or nonexistent public profiles \u2013 including Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos began emailing campaign officials about his new contacts with his \u201cgood friend\u201d Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman, whom he incorrectly believed was Mr. Putin\u2019s niece, and the possibility of a Trump-Putin meeting.On March 31, back in Washington, Mr. Papadopoulos met Mr. Trump for the first time at a gathering of his new foreign policy team at the candidate\u2019s Washington hotel. According to the former Trump adviser who was there, and who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid offending former colleagues, Mr. Papadopoulos spoke for a few minutes about his Russian contacts and the prospects for a meeting with the Russian president.But several people in the room began to raise questions about the wisdom of a meeting with Mr. Putin, noting that Russia was under sanctions from the United States. Jeff Sessions, now attorney general and then a senator from Alabama who was counseling Mr. Trump on national security, \u201cshut George down,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do it\u2019 and he added, \u2018I\u2019d prefer that nobody speak about this again.\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Papadopoulos was not deterred, the documents say, and he continued to communicate with Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman about more contacts. The Russian woman wrote on April 11, \u201cwe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump.\u201d Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos over email to a Moscow contact who said he had connections to the Russian foreign ministry. They spoke repeatedly over Skype about a possible Moscow trip, the documents say.On April 26 came a crucial meeting. At breakfast at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow, where he had \u201clearned that the Russians had obtained \u2018dirt\u2019 on then-candidate Clinton.\u201d Mr. Mifsud said he had been told the Russians had \u201cthousands of emails.\u201dOn May 4, the Russian contact with ties to the foreign ministry wrote to Mr. Papadopoulos and Mr. Mifsud, saying ministry officials were \u201copen for cooperation.\u201d Mr. Papadopoulos forwarded the message to a senior campaign official, asking whether the contacts were \u201csomething we want to move forward with.\u201dJ.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon official who worked for the Trump campaign as a national security adviser and helped arrange the March 31 foreign policy meeting, said he had known nothing about Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019 discovery that Russia had obtained Democratic emails or of his prolonged pursuit of meetings with Russians.\u201cI was surprised to learn what George Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign,\u201d Mr. Gordon said in a text message. \u201cHe obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Senator Sessions.\u201dMr. Gordon said that such end-runs around normal channels are common in presidential campaigns. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to know what every single person is doing, especially since some folks deliberately go around the chain of command,\u201d he said. \u201cBut George Papadopoulos obviously represents an extreme case.\u201dProsecutors may have deliberately left salient details out of the documents filed in court to protect the continuing investigation. But what they did say portrays Mr. Papadopoulos as continuing for months to arrange meetings with Russian officials. As late as August 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos was advised by a campaign official, apparently Mr. Clovis, to travel to Moscow \u201cif it is feasible.\u201dInstead of opening a new era in relations with Russia, Mr. Papadopoulos found himself caught up in the investigation of the Russian interference in the American election. The documents accuse him of lying to F.B.I. agents in two interviews, first on Jan. 27 and then on Feb. 16, when he \u201creiterated his purported willingness to cooperate with the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation,\u201d according to an affidavit filed by Robert M. Gibbs, an F.B.I. agent investigating the case.On Feb. 17, the agent wrote, Mr. Papadopoulos shut down the Facebook account he had used since 2005, including to exchange messages with the intermediaries for Russia. Prosecutors considered that to be obstruction of justice, and it became part of the case that concluded Oct. 5 when Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to make a false statement to the F.B.I., which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.An article on Tuesday about the Trump campaign\u2019s interactions with Russia misstated the steps that prosecutors took in connection with George Papadopoulos. Prosecutors unsealed Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s guilty plea on Monday; he was not indicted on Monday. (Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to making a false statement to the F.B.I.)Advertisement"}

The Grill already had one. For the Pool, which didn\u2019t, they requisitioned, redecorated, refurnished and renamed the mezzanine.An application has been belatedly filed to cover three major installations made without approval: the bar and the wall coverings of woven cotton, wool and silver threads in the lounge and the reception desk in the lobby off East 52nd Street. (Sheldon Werdiger, director of marketing and design development at RFR Holding, said in a statement that because furniture is not covered in the landmark designation, \u201cwe thought a new reception desk and bar in the lounge were additive fixtures to the space that can be easily removed and did not require LPC oversight.\u201d)But you don\u2019t need to be an architectural historian to see that none of them are remotely in the International Style. The large, inelegant reception desk belongs in an airport; you half expect to be asked if you\u2019re checking any luggage. But the more serious rupture is the Pool Lounge. Although the building\u2019s owner has argued that the Four Seasons used the mezzanine for private events and storage, it was open and in use for restaurant seating every time I ate in the old Pool Room. The tables up there, with their views of the lower dining room and the pool itself, were among the best in the house.Now the mezzanine looks as if it had been moved on a trailer from some other building and attached with thumbtacks. Its blue color scheme and rounded, Deco-inspired furniture fight with what is left of Johnson\u2019s right angles and natural tones. When the lounge is full, it\u2019s a distraction. When it\u2019s half-empty, as it often seems to be, it looms like a stage set waiting for the actors to show up. Either way, it sucks energy from the restaurant, which needs all it can get.Messing with the subtle dynamics that Johnson set in motion puts pressure on the cooking and the dining room staff to animate the room. They don\u2019t completely succeed right now.The Pool\u2019s problems don\u2019t include the ingredients, which are spectacular. The sweetness of chilled spot prawns under a few drops of olive oil made me shiver with pleasure. A trio of flash-seared Hokkaido sea scallop, Pacific mackerel whose skin had been peppered and griddled, and raw amberjack under tiny cells of finger lime suggested that Mr. Torrisi could run a stunning sushi restaurant.My eyes rolled back in my head whenever I ate sea urchin. In one appetizer, it is arranged on griddled pretzel bread with mustard oil and tiny cubes of green apple. In another, lobes of it are layered into an iced bowl to be eaten, with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and chives if you like, over blini, hard-cooked eggs, toast or, my favorites, creamy potato halves roasted in duck fat. (Caviar and trout roe are served the same way.)Mr. Torrisi\u2019s approach is to be lavish with punctiliously cared-for seafood and to outfit it sparingly. A beautiful illustration is the cured king salmon, two long, intensely flavorful strips served with a single potato dressed with mustard, shallots and dill. Another is any of the whole fish. The skin on turbot caught in Portugal is seared to a satisfying crackle on a plancha and served with a simple lemon vinaigrette. Like the Dover sole, it is lifted from its skeleton by a slim captain (they\u2019re all slim) who performs the surgery wearing a Tom Ford suit.But some of the more elaborate dishes are underwhelming. I don\u2019t know how striped bass with banana peppers and \u201cmole spices\u201d can be dull, but it is. Coconut-orange vinaigrette sounds like a terrific sauce for lobster, but it added very little except sweetness, which the lobster didn\u2019t need. Chopped gazpacho ingredients over a puddle of actual gazpacho was both too complicated (why not just serve gazpacho?) and too plain (the cucumbers and tomatoes didn\u2019t shine with flavor).Bottles of Chateau d\u2019Yquem going back to 1811 are kept in a glass wine room just off the entrance to the Pool, where they cast a beautiful amber glow that the servers are fond of pointing out. Enjoy it as you walk in, because this is as close as you will get to a dessert wine of any kind unless you are ready to spend at least $95, the price of the least expensive glass.The wine list is full of wonderful bottles, but its most noteworthy feature is its breezy lack of concern for normal budgets. Out of dozens of sparkling wines, more than 30 are priced above $1,000. Just one is under $90. This is quite a pinch to put on customers who are already paying between $39 and $74 for main courses.The Grill/Pool bifurcation extends to the dining room staff. In the Pool they are reserved, poised, deferential and seem to have been directed not to show any warmth or wit. Compared with the talkative, jokey characters in the Grill, who are ready to flamb\u00e9 something at the drop of a hat, the servers in the Pool are cardboard figures in tailored suits.Major Food Group has no fear of going over the top. So I\u2019m reluctant to suggest that the Pool needs more personality and drama \u2014 these guys are capable of stocking the pool with live sharks if they thought it would help. But the restaurant needs something, because at these prices, what might pass for restraint and simplicity can start to seem like a sophisticated heist.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sgt. Bergdahl\u2019s Sentence May Be Lighter Because of Trump\u2019s Comments", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFORT BRAGG, N.C. \u2014 President Trump\u2019s harsh criticism of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked off his Army post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, will weigh in favor of a lighter sentence for the sergeant, a military judge said on Monday.\u201cI will consider the president\u2019s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence,\u201d the judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, said during a hearing at Fort Bragg. The judge is expected to sentence Sergeant Bergdahl in the next few weeks.Sergeant Bergdahl faces up to life imprisonment. He pleaded guilty on Oct. 16 to desertion and endangering the troops who were sent to search for him.He testified on Monday that he deeply regretted that people \u201csuffered because of my bad choices.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m admitting I made a horrible mistake,\u201d the sergeant said on the witness stand. \u201cIt was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen.\u201dAs a candidate, Mr. Trump repeatedly called Sergeant Bergdahl a traitor and suggested that he should be executed or returned to the Taliban. On Oct. 16, Mr. Trump seemed to endorse those earlier sentiments, declining to say anything new about the case but adding, \u201cI think people have heard my comments in the past.\u201dAn Army investigator initially recommended that there be no jail time for Sergeant Bergdahl, who was held and tortured by the Taliban for five years. But anger \u2014 on the part of politicians and members of the military \u2014 over the sergeant\u2019s actions may have contributed to the fact that he now faces the possibility of a long sentence.In sentencing, mitigating factors weigh in favor of leniency while aggravating factors tip the scales toward harsher punishment. The judge\u2019s decision means he will weigh Mr. Trump\u2019s comments along with other mitigating factors presented by the defense, including evidence that Sergeant Bergdahl had a severe mental disorder and suffered torture in captivity.Colonel Nance will also consider aggravating factors presented by the prosecution, including injuries suffered by several service members during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, as well as the negative impact they say the search had on the military\u2019s overall war effort in Afghanistan.Anger over the injuries has driven much of the testimony in the case so far, as service members vividly described a rescue operation that exposed them to enemy fire. Shannon Allen, the wife of Sgt. First Class Mark Allen, who was shot in the head took the stand on Monday.Sergeant Allen, a national guardsman from Georgia, had part of his brain removed during surgery, and is now unable to speak, walk, or take care of himself. His wife has said little publicly, but in a Facebook post after Sergeant Bergdahl was freed, she blamed him for causing her husband\u2019s incapacitation.\u201cInstead of being his wife, I have become his caregiver,\u201d Ms. Allen testified on Monday.Last week, Staff Sgt. Jason Walters testified that his six-man team had only just arrived in Afghanistan when they were sent to search for Sergeant Bergdahl. They had little time to prepare for the rugged terrain of Paktika Province, and little intelligence to go on.On the second morning of the search, \u201can insane amount of fire came out of nowhere,\u201d Sergeant Walters said. Militants had them surrounded. In minutes, half the team had been wounded. Sergeant Walters turned to see \u201ca cloud of blood\u201d spraying from the head of Sergeant Allen.\u201cI started treating his wounds, talking to him, telling him to hang on,\u201d Sergeant Walters said.The battle subsided only after F-15 fighter jets and Apache helicopters arrived overhead.Only later would the troops learn that the battalion responsible for the area believed that 150 Taliban fighters were near the village where the soldiers were resting when they came under fire.\u201cMy words can\u2019t take away what people have been through,\u201d Sergeant Bergdahl told the court on Monday. \u201cOffering condolences is not enough. People went through things they shouldn\u2019t have had to go through. I grieve for those who have suffered and their families.\u201dThe Army\u2019s investigation of the rescue operation described faults with its planning, preparation, equipment and intelligence. Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s defense team has also argued to the judge that the Taliban \u2014 not their client \u2014 were directly responsible for Sergeant Allen\u2019s wounds.Prosecutors have sought to show that the attack would have played out similarly even without the problems cited. Increased risks were acceptable, they say, if the missing soldier was thought to be near.But in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the investigation showed, some of Sergeant Allen\u2019s comrades were upset with the officers who ordered the operation.\u201cWe should have never went out there in the first place, and we would not have lost three of our guys in the process,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Travis Scott Elmore, referring to the wounded. He was one of the six-member Embedded Training Team, or E.T.T. He had been told only afterward that the battalion responsible for that area believed there were 150 Taliban fighters nearby.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the manpower, and that was the first mission that our E.T.T. team has ever conducted\u201d with Afghan troops, he said in a sworn statement to Army investigators.Sergeant Walters suggested that commanders never would have sent their own men from the battalion on such a high-risk patrol.\u201cThey treat us like a redheaded stepchild whose only purpose there is to be used at their convenience and for the missions they don\u2019t want to risk their own men on,\u201d he wrote in his statement.In court, Sergeant Bergdahl gave details about his captivity, saying that he had once used a nail sharpened with a rock to pick the locks on his shackles and escape. He had planned to subsist on grass, he said, but because the area was heavily populated by herds of sheep and goats, there was little available.He fell off a cliff into a dry riverbed, he said. After eight days at large, he would \u201cblack out and fall over\u201d when he tried to stand up.When he was recaptured, the Taliban beat him and placed him in a cage that would be his home for the next four years, he said.Another search for Sergeant Bergdahl, this one conducted at night, was recounted last week by Jimmy Hatch, who was a Senior Chief Petty Officer and member of a Navy SEAL special operations team. After helicopters dropped off his team, Chief Hatch sent his military working dog after two people he suspected were enemy fighters. One shot the dog in the head. The other sprayed his gun wildly.The muzzle flashes allowed American troops to locate and kill the fighters \u2014 but not before one shot Chief Hatch, shattering his thighbone, he said. He would later have 18 surgical procedures, and still walks with a pronounced limp.\u201cI was worse than useless,\u201d Chief Hatch said, recalling his fear that his screams might endanger fellow troops.Specialist Jonathan Morita, whose finger bones shattered when an unexploded rocket-propelled grenade struck his hand, has regained only limited use of his hand.Specialist Morita testified that he suffers from a short temper because of his experience. He said his anger is directed \u201ctoward one person.\u201dHe did not name names. But as he left the witness stand and walked past the defense table, he shot Sergeant Bergdahl a withering glare.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Rebel Puppeteers of Sudan", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsI began making this film in 2015, aiming to upend the prevailing narrative of conflict in Sudan by showing so-called victims defy two strongmen at the helm of the conflict. In an age of ascendant nationalism, it is also an example of how people use comedy to deal with authoritarian rule, no matter where they are.I met this film\u2019s protagonist, Ganja, in 2015 during my first visit to the Nuba Mountains of Sudan. I had traveled to the rebel-held capital of Kauda to train journalists, but was soon distracted by the making of an episode of \u201cBisha TV,\u201d a satirical puppet show that mocked the Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir and his cronies.The writers, a mix of journalists and members of a drama group, met in the shade of a great mango tree. Fueled by sweet tea, they churned out scripts. Curious villagers gathered around the set during the first days of filming. When the crew unwrapped the puppets, the crowd collectively screamed. Children tripped over one another as they ran from an effigy of the president responsible for tormenting them. But the puppets, handmade in South Africa, were not designed to sustain Nuba\u2019s heat, and the autocrats\u2019 heads began to melt. The theater of the absurd continued like this both on and off camera.\u201cBisha TV\u201d followed the lead of two other popular satirical African puppet shows: Kenya\u2019s \u201cXYZ Show\u201d and South Africa\u2019s \u201cZanews.\u201d Both programs upset politicians and struggled to find broadcasters, but \u201cBisha TV\u201d debuted in a far more hostile and restricted media climate. Journalists are regularly imprisoned and tortured in Sudan for reporting on wars and human rights abuses. Sudan is so rived by the conflict that news of these atrocities in the Nuba Mountains, Darfur and Blue Nile rarely reaches Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum. While making this film, I took a surreal trip to Khartoum, where I met Sudanese who told me their country was at peace.Europe and the U.S. are in the process of normalizing relations with Sudan, once a pariah state that hosted Osama bin Laden. Just before leaving office, President Barack Obama initiated the lifting of 20-year-old economic sanctions against Khartoum, citing improved counterterrorism efforts. Sudan sends troops to fight the Saudi-led war against Houthi rebels in Yemen.Over the past year, piecemeal cease-fires between the government and Sudan\u2019s various rebel movements have delivered a tenuous peace. Still, humanitarian aid remains blocked in the Nuba Mountains, and refugees from Darfur are too wary to return home. \u201cBisha TV\u201d is on hiatus, but the lessons of the show remain: Irreverence is resistance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Peruvian Grilled Chicken: A Spicy, Succulent Delight", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteSpit-grilled chicken (pollo a la brasa) is popular all over Latin America. But it\u2019s the Peruvian version that\u2019s best known here in the United States, buoyed by the many restaurants that serve the bird in all its burnished, garlic-scented, drippings-slicked glory. Usually, they serve a spicy, creamy cilantro sauce alongside that is the perfect complement \u2014 and delicious in its own right.Peruvian chicken is worth learning to make at home because few things beat the crackling skin of a home-roasted chicken, especially when it\u2019s been marinated in garlic, chiles and plenty of spices.To mimic the juiciness and char of a grill, in this version the chicken is split down the middle before roasting at high heat. You can ask your butcher to do this or go at it yourself with a pair of sturdy kitchen shears; it\u2019s not at all hard. Or substitute a cut-up bird, removing the breasts from the oven a few minutes before the legs and thighs so the white meat doesn\u2019t dry out.Before roasting, you\u2019ll need to marinate the chicken.While the chicken roasts, whip up the spicy cilantro sauce to serve alongside. Like the marinade, there are dozens of versions of this creamy, rich mix. Some recipes call for peanuts to give the sauce body and heft, others rely on mayo. This one uses feta cheese for a salty bite. Then slather it liberally over the bird, because the combination of spiced, crispy chicken skin and the creamy herb sauce is magical \u2014 particularly when it\u2019s been made by you.And to Drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At This Brooklyn Bar, It\u2019s Just You, Your Date and the Barman", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic drinking in New York can be a chore. Many of the city\u2019s bars are about as intimate as a rush-hour subway. Others serve as the stalking grounds for happy-hour predators. When the suits and ties arrive, it can be hard to find a stool or to get your glass refilled.But last week, on a wide industrial avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn, a new bar opened catering to patrons who prefer to take their cocktails in extreme seclusion. About as wide as the average human arm span, it sits inside the supply closet of a shuttered Italian restaurant. Capacity is limited to three: the bartender, you and your date.But his current venture is entirely legitimate: It has a liquor license and receives a monthly rent bill from its landlord. Lawfulness aside, it was designed according to Mr. Austin\u2019s signature aesthetic: instilling odd spaces with an odd sense of wonder.On one wall hangs a panoply of mixological instruments: stirrers, shakers, sterling silver straws, a chemist\u2019s collection of graduated flasks. On the other are shelves of antique glassware, some of which came from Mr. Austin\u2019s grandmother.The drinks are concocted from a wide array of esoteric liquors and liqueurs, which might on different nights include a custom gin made in Vermont that looks and tastes like whiskey, or a 138-proof \u201cElixir Vegetal\u201d brewed by the monks of the Grande Chartreuse monastery in France.The evening isn\u2019t cheap: The going rate is $100 to $120 a head for about an hour of service. For that you get a menu of five or six 3-ounce mini-cocktails, bearing names like Johann Goes to Mexico; you also get the close-quarter company of your partner and your host.Mr. Sheidlower said the tightness of the Tollbooth has had interesting effects on the clientele.

{"Headline": "Meddling With Monarchs", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNashville \u2014 Back in July, as I sat before the butterfly enclosure in my family room, waiting to see if maggots would emerge from a twitching monarch caterpillar clinging to the screen at the top of the cage, two thoughts occurred to me: Is the caterpillar suffering? And is this what obsession looks like?Milkweed is the only plant that a monarch will lay her eggs on and the only plant a monarch caterpillar will eat, so when the milkweed bloomed, I gathered their seeds and replanted, in case the butterflies turned up late this year. They did not turn up late. Deciding to jump-start the whole process, I finally ordered a dozen caterpillars from a teacher-supply catalog and jury-rigged an enclosure over the milkweed bed. It was full dark by the time I finished anchoring the mosquito netting to the ground.In the morning I found a hole in the net and three caterpillars missing. Over the next two weeks, most of the others disappeared or died. The last two actually got so far as to form a chrysalis, but a storm knocked one of them to the ground before it had fully hardened. The other I brought inside according to recommendations from the monarch groups I\u2019d joined on Facebook. That last chrysalis seemed healthy, but the butterfly couldn\u2019t break free despite painstaking assistance from a pair of tweezers I was wielding on advice from the online chorus. Hours later, when I reported that the half-emerged butterfly had died, my computer erupted with crying-face emojis. I felt like crying myself.A pollinator garden never goes to waste, and this year I\u2019ve had a bumper crop of gulf fritillaries, swallowtails, clouded sulfurs and one hackberry emperor \u2014 as well as a tiny gray hairstreak butterfly, smaller than my pinkie fingernail. The honeybees and wasps and bumblebees have been in heaven here, too, and hummingbirds kept trying to guard the flowers from seed-hunting goldfinches, who cling to the stems and rip the petals apart in a paroxysm that looks exactly like joy. But there has been no sign of monarchs, and I planted this garden for them.Of all the assaults on the monarch population, climate change may prove the most pernicious. In summer, excessive heat stresses developing caterpillars already vulnerable to diseases and predators. In fall, unseasonable warmth can prevent them from heading south in time to reach their wintering grounds, and extreme weather events like hurricanes can destroy an entire wave of the migration before it reaches Mexico. Worst of all, climate change threatens the monarchs\u2019 wintering grounds, where very specific environmental conditions keep them in a hibernation-like state. In winter, unstable temperatures in Mexico can wake the butterflies too early from hibernation, sending them north before the nectar flowers they feed on have bloomed. And by some estimates, that microclimate high in the mountains of Mexico will all but disappear by 2030.Since I had no eggs to collect from my own milkweed, I decided to order another set of caterpillars from a different supplier and try again indoors. I put them in a professionally manufactured butterfly enclosure and fed them milkweed leaves I\u2019d sterilized and rinsed. The monarch stewards in my online groups were having glorious success with this method, releasing hundreds of monarchs they\u2019d collected as eggs earlier in the summer. They kept posting videos of the newly emerged butterflies walking delicately over their hands, and I was going a little mad with jealousy. I typed in my credit-card number one more time.O.K., two more times. Still, not a single caterpillar survived.I haven\u2019t decided whether I\u2019ll go on a quest for wild monarch eggs when these lovely creatures return to Middle Tennessee next spring, but I think it\u2019s time to admit that the pollinator garden I\u2019ve planted here in sterile suburbia is just not big enough to attract a migrating butterfly high in the sky. Still, it\u2019s possible, and if there\u2019s any sight more heart-lifting than a monarch butterfly glowing in the sunshine, I don\u2019t know what it might be. When I finally saw one the other day, it was flying straight down the middle of my street, heading south.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Finds Accounts Connected to Russia Bought Election Ads", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has found evidence that Russian agents bought ads on its wide-ranging networks in an effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential campaign.The findings from an internal inquiry draw Google further into the growing investigation of how social networks and technology services were manipulated by the Russian government to spread misinformation and sow division during the 2016 election.Using accounts believed to be connected to the Russian government, the agents purchased $4,700 worth of search ads and more traditional display ads, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s inquiry who was not allowed to speak about it publicly. Google found the accounts through its own research and information provided by other technology companies.Google found a separate $53,000 worth of ads with political material that were purchased from Russian internet addresses, building addresses or with Russian currency. It is not clear whether any of those were connected to the Russian government, and they may have been purchased by Russian citizens, the person said.The messages of those ads spanned the political spectrum. One account spent $7,000 on ads to promote a documentary called \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Trumped,\u201d a film about Donald J. Trump\u2019s efforts to build a golf course in Scotland along an environmentally sensitive coastline. Another spent $36,000 on ads questioning whether President Barack Obama needed to resign. Yet another bought ads to promote political merchandise for Mr. Obama.The ads appeared mainly alongside Google\u2019s search results or on websites that use Google ads outside the search company\u2019s own sites. It was not clear whether such ads appeared on YouTube or the Gmail email service, the person said.There is a chance that Google may find other ads from Russian-linked accounts, the person familiar with the investigation said.Microsoft, a distant rival to Google in the internet search and advertising market, said Monday evening that it too was examining whether suspected Russian agents used its services to show political ads during the 2016 election. Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine accounts for about 23 percent of searches in the United States, compared with more than 63 percent for Google, according comScore, an internet measurement firm.Google has been called to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1. But it has so far escaped the intense scrutiny confronting Facebook after the social network admitted that it discovered 470 profiles and pages to the internet Research Agency, a Russian company with ties to the Kremlin.The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said on Monday that it should not be surprising that Russians were using Google as well as Facebook and Twitter. The only thing that is surprising, he said, is that it took so long for Google to find the activity.\u201cIt will take more time and length and breadth to know what Russia did on social media,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cBut the themes are consistent across platforms: the desire to help Donald Trump, to hurt Hillary Clinton and the desire to set Americans against each other.\u201dIn addition to the Senate committee hearing, Google and Facebook are expected to testify at another Nov. 1 hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. Twitter was also invited to the House committee hearing, but it was not clear on Monday whether officials from the company planned to attend.But Google\u2019s investigation has not found the same type of pinpoint advertising that Russian agents conducted on Facebook. The social network allows advertisers to target its audience with more specificity than Google, including users with a wide range of political leanings.The 2016 presidential election was the first time that Google allowed targeting by political leanings and it allowed just two categories \u2014 left-leaning and right-leaning.However, Google has not found any evidence that the ads from the accounts suspected of having ties to the Russian government used these political categories or geographic parameters to focus on specific groups, the person familiar with the company\u2019s investigation said. The ads were much more broad, aimed at English-language queries or any users in the United States, for example.A Google spokeswoman, Andrea Faville, said the company had a policy that limited political ad targeting and prohibited targeting based on race and religion.\u201cWe are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,\u201d Ms. Faville said.On Facebook, fake Russia-linked accounts \u2014 in which fictional people posed as American activists \u2014 promoted inflammatory messages on divisive issues. Those accounts bought advertising to promote those messages and reach a bigger audience within the Facebook universe, while promoting the incendiary posts to different locations or people with established political leanings for maximum impact.The Russian-linked accounts did not target ads based on political affiliation, but it raises the question of why Google allowed such targeting for the 2016 election when it had not done so in the past. The only location where Google allows ad targeting by political affiliation is the United States.Google is working with Jigsaw, a think tank owned by its parent company, Alphabet. Jigsaw has been doing research for 18 months on fake news and misinformation campaigns and Google is applying some of those findings in the investigation into Russian election meddling, the person said. It is also working with other technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, in addition to independent researchers and law enforcement.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter @daiwakaCecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington, and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Military Women, Too, Should Serve Unmolested", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIt was 2004 and I had been in the Army for only three months when I first began to suspect something was wrong. I was walking by our drill sergeant\u2019s desk, where he sat, leaning back in his chair. On the floor in front of him was a newly arrived female soldier. She was on her back, dressed in T-shirt and shorts, doing scissor kicks. He sat perfectly poised to see her crotch and the insides of her thighs.In one sense, this wasn\u2019t unusual. In Advanced Individual Training, soldiers are drilled in technical skills after Combat Basic Training. Here we get \u201csmoked\u201d \u2014 we are given grueling punishments designed to build us up physically and break us down mentally so that we can be whip-shaped into soldiers who do exactly as told. The soldier on her back was doing exactly as told.I was in the same class as this woman at Fort Gordon, a military installation set among the world-famous golf courses of Augusta, Ga. The drill sergeant had a reputation of \u201csmoking out\u201d women with flutter kicks and other sexually driven punishments, but at the time, I viewed my drill sergeants with great reverence. It seemed then to be something rare, something I would never seen again in the military. I was wrong.A few months later, at my first duty station at Camp Hovey in South Korea, my platoon sergeant told me very directly that all female soldiers were \u201clazy sluts\u201d and that I was going to become one too. He explained to me that the military was undergoing a uniform change, not to allow us to mesh into the desert and urban jungles of emerging combat environments but because more women were joining the military and we were all \u201cdirty whores.\u201dAfter months of daily berating from my platoon sergeant, I finally mustered the courage to tell my 1st sergeant, the senior enlisted leader at my company. He listened without much response and the next day moved me to another platoon. I was grateful, but I also noticed that no action was taken against the platoon sergeant. Because soldiers generally get moved because of misconduct, rumors began to spread about me. As is often the case with harassment or assault, I, the victim, was shamed.I witnessed misogyny at all levels of my six years in the military. On Monday mornings, while working in the motor pool to clean and maintain our Humvees, male soldiers would gather around a single cellphone to watch porn and talk in detail of their sexual escapades. I quickly learned and got accustomed to hearing terms for violent sexual activity too graphic to detail here. This language and the images of sexual violence they represented quickly became part of my psychological reality. I myself began to objectify women, and found myself troubled and confused by my own gender identity.Misogyny was present in the smallest of things, like the nude pinups of women that the chain of command allowed in work shelters, but bigger things, too, like the frequent accounts of male-on-female assault and rape. One of my friends, on a deployment to Afghanistan, was so brutally raped by a male soldier that she is now physically unable to carry and give birth to a child. (She was recently medically discharged after 19 years of active duty and in is in rehabilitation for post-traumatic stress disorder, including daily thoughts of suicide.) Another friend, while stationed in South Korea, was tied up in her bedroom, raped and beaten by several male soldiers, then found in a bloody bath four days later.The military, more than any other American institution, runs on an unwavering chain of command. It is entirely based on the taking and giving of orders. But there remain entrenched problems with the system of military justice. It is the chain of command that is responsible for investigation and punishment of sexual assaults.Some in the military have decided on their own that it will stop, with them.When I was moved into a different platoon in South Korea, I fell under the leadership of the man who would become my mentor. With his guidance, I pushed myself physically, getting near-perfect scores on my fitness and marksmanship tests. He helped me study for Soldier of the Month competitions, which I won numerous times. This led to my promotion to sergeant, just shy of my second anniversary of being in the Army. When rumors spread that I was promoted because I must have slept around, my mentor sat down with the rest of my platoon and set them straight. He told them forcefully that it was not true and to cease the rumor spreading immediately.Because someone defended me at that critical moment, and because of guidance from other true leaders, I was able to sharpen my mental and physical acumen and attain positions in the United States Embassy in Iraq and as a member of the personal staff for Lt. Gen. Frank Helmick, the former commanding general of the XVIII Airborne Corps. General Helmick nurtured my passion for writing and planted the seed for me to later pursue it professionally. These positive experiences with men greatly enhanced my self-worth and have helped me succeed, both in and out of the military.I wish I could say my military career ended well, but it didn\u2019t. As my career progressed, I was confronted with more poor treatment by my superiors. It became all too clear to me that despite the many devoted, professional men who hold up the honor of military service, the atmosphere toward women in general had not changed.The military is morally obligated to stop the systemwide mistreatment of women in its ranks, but that change will not be made until it is enforced from the top leadership on down. It is too big and important a job to be left to a few good men.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rabbi Finds Love on Tinder", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsA rabbi anxiously walked into a bar.Andrew Scheer, the rabbi in question, was about to have a first date with Avital Zipper. Mr. Scheer\u2019s vocation was frequently a deal breaker once a woman learned of it.\u201cI love being a rabbi \u2014 it\u2019s a great honor \u2014 but I would have to dance around what I did for a living and when I told them. It was like they were 12 years old again and speaking to their rabbi at their bat mitzvah,\u201d said Rabbi Scheer, 31, who is Modern Orthodox, grew up in Woodmere, N.Y., and is a Jewish chaplain for the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System and the New York City Department of Correction.\u201cThe girls I was meeting were lovely, but they were expecting a doctor or lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a rabbi really impeded my dating life.\u201dUntil Nov. 11, 2015. After trying JSwipe, JCrush, JDate, even OkCupid, Rabbi Scheer seemed to have found success on Tinder. That\u2019s when Ms. Zipper, 30, popped up on his phone, and the app showed they had five mutual friends. Rabbi Scheer scoured Facebook to find out more. When he returned to Tinder, Ms. Zipper was gone.\u201cThey reshuffled the deck,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to find her again on the app could take hours. So I sent her a message on Facebook explaining what had happened, and to let me know if she was interested.\u201dMs. Zipper thought the message was a little weird, but was also intrigued. The following day she wrote back.\u201cHe was 29 when we met and my settings started at 30, so I never would have seen his profile,\u201d Ms. Zipper said. \u201cWe never would have met if he didn\u2019t send me a message request. I could see we had mutual friends. I thought, Why not? Tinder, JSwipe, Facebook, what\u2019s the difference? I had no idea he was a rabbi.\u201dHere\u2019s where the bar comes in. When they decided to meet the same night that she had replied to his query, they also found out that they lived only a few blocks from each other.When Rabbi Scheer entered Taproom No. 307 at 8 p.m., Ms. Zipper was seated on a stool waiting for him. By 2 a.m., they were the last people to leave. During those six hours his vocation came up.\u201cI grew up religious, but he didn\u2019t look like the rabbis I grew up with,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he told me what he did, it was unexpected, but it didn\u2019t freak me out. He\u2019s not that random banker or millennial worker who\u2019s doing his own thing.\u201dMs. Zipper was also impressed by his kindness. \u201cI was really raw about my father, who passed away three months before we met. He was a veteran, and Andrew worked in the V.A. and the day before was Veterans Day,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was so compassionate. That really struck me. I felt understood.\u201dRabbi Scheer felt similarly. \u201cI was touched by how she spoke about her father,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I told her I was a chaplain, she said she thought it was great. She didn\u2019t make me feel bad about it. That\u2019s not a feeling I\u2019d felt with anyone prior. It felt like I found someone who got me.\u201dA few weeks later he invited Ms. Zipper to a Hanukkah party at Rikers Island. To his surprise, she accepted.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe she was willing to go to a jail,\u201d Rabbi Scheer said. \u201cWhen we entered, she went right to the women inmates\u2019 side and joined them and their families. She fell right into it like it was the most normal thing. She was dancing and talking to them. It was beautiful to behold.\u201dThe couple became exclusive after that. Then a trip was planned to Indianapolis using points, miles and a Hyatt gift card previously bought on DansDeals.com.\u201cYou don\u2019t really know someone until you travel with them,\u201d Rabbi Scheer said. \u201cI got two rooms. I told her if things don\u2019t work out, we can cancel last minute. It\u2019s all refundable.\u201dThe trip fell over Valentine\u2019s Day. Rabbi Scheer had cheesecake and chocolate-covered strawberries in the room waiting for Ms. Zipper, two things she loves.The weekend was a success. Then Ms. Zipper met Rabbi Scheer\u2019s family. He went to Florida for her grandmother\u2019s 95th birthday, followed by a jaunt to Denver, her hometown. While there, the couple visited her father\u2019s grave.\u201cWe stood there and prayed,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the hardest parts was not going into the professional mode, and just being her boyfriend, not her chaplain.\u201dA year passed, and the couple grew inseparable. Then came the proposal.On March 11, 2017, in 15-degree weather, under the Williamsburg Bridge, a favorite spot where the pair often biked or roller-bladed, Rabbi Scheer got down on one knee and presented an unsuspecting Ms. Zipper with his grandmother\u2019s diamond ring.\u201cLooking back, I should have known he was up to something because he never offers to go running with me,\u201d she said of the proposal. \u201cI was caught off guard because we\u2019d only talked about getting married in broad ways. But we\u2019d both said each of us was the person we\u2019d like to be with. He proposed two months after that conversation.\u201dOf course Ms. Zipper accepted.They decided to have a short engagement. Modern Orthodox Judaism states that couples cannot live together until they are married. The couple moved quickly. Within the first week, a wedding dress was found at a local shop. A venue was picked. Rabbi Scheer\u2019s grandmother\u2019s ring was resized. A list containing the names of florists, bands and photographers was solidified.In August, a small apartment with only one closet in the East Village of Manhattan, just blocks from their synagogue, was secured. Then came registering at Bed Bath & Beyond and the selling of many of their belongings on Craigslist. First went the love seat and couch, followed by the ottoman, chair, TV, desk and guitar, among other possessions. Unwanted clothing, pictures and other items went to Goodwill.\u201cTali\u2019s stuff is nicer than mine, so it sold faster, but I\u2019ve been more proactive about selling it,\u201d Rabbi Scheer said.Ms. Zipper was happy to let go of her stuff. \u201cWe\u2019re minimalists,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have things we feel super-connected to. We\u2019re liquidating our lives in order to start over. The new furnishings we\u2019ll be ordering we\u2019ll be owning together. New things, new life.\u201dOn Sept. 10, Rabbi Avi Weiss, at Temple Beth El in Cedarhurst, N.Y., married the couple in front of 275 guests.The bride\u2019s side of the family, most of whom were from Florida, were either flown in early or rented cars and drove, missing Hurricane Irma\u2019s wrath.Sharon Chesler, 37, Ms. Zipper\u2019s first cousin, with whom she lived for the last several years, remembers how the couple got together. \u201cWe were both working at home when she got Andrew\u2019s message,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked her if it was creepy or interesting, and she said, \u2018I\u2019m intrigued,\u2019 and wrote him back.\u201dMs. Chesler cited Rabbi Scheer\u2019s shared religious background as part of the attraction. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing she found someone when she wasn\u2019t actively searching in the Orthodox community,\u201d she said. \u201cI also told her, \u2018Your mother\u2019s going to die when she finds out what he does for a living. There\u2019s nothing that would make her happier.\u2019 \u201dPamela Scheer, 65, however, was unaware of how her son met his new bride. \u201cHe\u2019s always been very private,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t even make me his friend on Facebook, even though we are an extremely close family. In January he called and said he was bringing a friend to his father\u2019s birthday dinner.\u201dShe asked if it was a man or a woman.\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure the girl he wanted existed,\u201d Ms. Scheer said. \u201cBut she does. They just have this connection. He wasn\u2019t complete before. But she completes him. She\u2019s his meant-to-be.\u201dThe wedding contained many highlights, including the signing of the ketubah, the Jewish marriage contract, and the bedeken, a traditional veiling ritual in which the groom confirms the bride\u2019s identity. There was also an hourlong heartfelt ceremony; speeches; a tribute song (\u201cYou\u2019ll Be Back\u201d from \u201cHamilton,\u201d rewritten and performed by the bride\u2019s four siblings); and a dance-a-thon.Before the married couple sat at their table in the dining room, they took an opportunity to mentally embrace the room, and each other.\u201cI\u2019d gotten advice from friends and our rabbi, who said to take a moment, and I felt like we needed to do that,\u201d Ms. Zipper said. \u201cWe needed a breath to see what we put together, and all the people who came to celebrate with us, and a moment to see the love. I got to see all the love.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "George Papadopoulos, First to Plead Guilty in Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A young foreign policy consultant whom President Trump once praised as an \u201cexcellent guy\u201d is the first aide in the Trump campaign to plead guilty in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into ties between the president\u2019s associates and the Russian government.Earlier that month, Mr. Papadopoulos, 30, first communicated with a professor in London with links to the Russian government, according to court documents unsealed Monday. The professor was later identified as Joseph Mifsud, according to a Senate aide familiar with the case.The relationship between Mr. Papadopoulos and Professor Mifsud would lead Mr. Papadopoulos to two other people with ties to the Russian government and to attempts to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, the documents said. In April, the professor told Mr. Papadopoulos that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton in \u201cthousands of emails.\u201dMr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty this month to lying to the F.B.I. about that conversation when he was first interviewed in January. At the time, he told agents that Professor Mifsud was \u201ca nothing.\u201d But Mr. Papadopoulos now acknowledges that he knew the professor had \u201csubstantial connections to Russian government officials.\u201dThe plea offers the most specific evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 allegations that the White House again denied on Monday.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, played down Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s role as \u201ca volunteer member of an advisory council that literally met one time.\u201dAfter he was interviewed by the F.B.I. a second time, Mr. Papadopoulos changed his phone number and deleted a Facebook account that he used to communicate with Russian officials, according to the court documents.Attempts to reach Mr. Papadopoulos, who is based in Chicago, and his relatives in that area were unsuccessful on Monday. Robert W. Stanley, one of Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s lawyers, declined to comment and would not say where his client was. Mr. Papadopoulos was arrested in July when he arrived at Dulles International Airport outside Washington.Mr. Papadopoulos pitched himself to Mr. Carson\u2019s team as a foreign policy expert who could raise a substantial amount of money for the candidate from the Greek-American community, according to a Republican official familiar with the interaction. Mr. Papadopoulos listed Kenneth Weinstein, the chief executive of the Hudson Institute, where he had worked on a contract basis, as a reference.The Carson campaign offered him a paid position on the national security and foreign policy advisory committee, and he promised to move to Northern Virginia, where the campaign was based, but he relocated to Chicago instead to be closer to his girlfriend, the official said.Later, after the Carson campaign began to unravel, Mr. Papadopoulos reached out to several of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates, including the policy director Sam Clovis, who was eager to assemble a foreign policy advisory council after dozens of military and diplomatic officials signed a letter describing Mr. Trump as unfit to serve as president.Mr. Trump was widely criticized for having an inexperienced team of foreign policy advisers.A former Trump campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Papadopoulos was \u201calmost fired\u201d after the young aide, without the approval of senior officials, told British news media that Prime Minister David Cameron should apologize for calling Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks on barring Muslims from the United States \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong.\u201dBy fall 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos had fallen out of favor. In an email to one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers, Mr. Papadopoulos asked plaintively if he was being shut out for \u201cgiving an interview I wasn\u2019t supposed to give,\u201d according to an aide who was given a copy of the message. No answer was given, the person said.Then, a week before the campaign, he reached out to top advisers to discuss an event he hoped to schedule with a congressman he described as a close friend, Gus Bilirakis, Republican of Florida. He did not receive a reply.School district officials in Skokie, Ill., near Chicago, said Mr. Papadopoulos graduated in 2005 from Niles West High School. As an undergraduate at DePaul University in Chicago, he studied political science, a university spokeswoman said. He later attended the University College of London, according to his LinkedIn profile.Reporting was contributed by Adam Goldman, Scott Shane and Nicholas Fandos from Washington, and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

My husband is overnighting us particulate masks to breathe through because Home Depot and all the Ace Hardware stores nearby are sold out, just like they sold out of every single fan in August, during the heat wave. It\u2019s the latest version of California\u2019s new normal: Add masks to your emergency kit, don\u2019t breathe deeply and try to stay inside.It\u2019s been seven days now of some of the Bay Area\u2019s worst ever air quality, and most of the fires north of us in Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties are minimally contained, or not at all. The smog enveloping Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other cities is literal and figurative: There has been little clarity about how best to protect ourselves. The consensus seems to be that we\u2019re not supposed to exercise, that we should refrain from driving as much as possible and that if we do venture outside we should be wearing the kind of heavy-duty face masks that keep out the smallest particulate matter, these gray ashes that are falling from the sky.My friend Iris and I brainstorm about the most airtight public spaces, places like movie theaters or hospitals that can filter air for large numbers of people, so we can gather there. She researches which filters really work for smoke pollution, and texts a group of us to say her living room will have the filter on at all times for anyone who needs to come over.So many of my friends work remotely \u2014 writers and freelancers who often sit in the Bay Area breeze all day, squinting into their laptops. But the coffee shops and co-working spaces aren\u2019t airtight, and today my usual ones are mostly empty. I\u2019m writing this from the public library in East Oakland, because my friend Samantha said if you work from home that\u2019s the best place to go right now \u2014 most public libraries have central air filtration and are not pulling the smoky air from the outside. Another friend, Jessie, tells me that the library at San Francisco\u2019s Civic Center is unusually packed with hipsters.There\u2019s a gray light over everything all day long. On the last six evenings, we\u2019ve had what in any other situation you\u2019d call a gorgeous sunset, the bright orange sun a perfect disk framed in gray between the Marin Headlands. But as I step out of my car I look away from it, shielding my face from its apocalyptic light.I wonder if this will become our new way of life, if slowly we\u2019re just going to get used to avoiding the air. My husband reminds me not to turn on the air conditioner or central fan in our house because it will bring in smoke from outside. I press down every window to make sure it\u2019s tight, and cancel a run with my neighbor after work because neither of us wants to even walk the slight uphill climb to the park.People I\u2019ve never thought could relate to this situation write to me on the internet. My friend who used to live in China posts advice on my Facebook wall about how to survive air pollution and when to decide enough is enough, and leave.It can feel that way here right now \u2014 some of our best-known tourist destinations burned to ashes, regular avalanches on our highways. A friend notes that we can no longer refer to a \u201cfire season\u201d in California because the inferno of fires just seem to blend one into the next.

YouTube Helped.", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Kremlin-aligned agents secretly built fake Facebook groups to foment political division and deployed hordes of Twitter bots to stoke criticism of Hillary Clinton, RT worked out in the open, bolstered by one of the largest online audiences of any news organization in the world and a prominent presence on YouTube\u2019s search results.\u201cMore than half of American adults say they watch YouTube, and younger viewers are moving to YouTube at staggering numbers,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia\u2019s exploitation of social media platforms based in the United States. \u201cYouTube is a target-rich environment for any disinformation campaign \u2014 Russian or otherwise \u2014 that represents a long-term, next-generation challenge.\u201dYouTube carries \u201ca wide variety of news channels\u201d that represent \u201can array of viewpoints across the political spectrum,\u201d said a spokesman for the company, Chris Dale.RT\u2019s reach on YouTube \u2014 2.2 million subscribers, just slightly behind CNN \u2014 stemmed from a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the news channel and the video site, according to current and former RT employees and technology industry analysts.YouTube had the vast audience and global reach that RT needed as it set out to become a worldwide alternative news source with influence and viewers beyond Russia\u2019s own borders. RT has YouTube channels in a number of foreign languages including Arabic, Spanish, German, French and Chinese.\u201cRT management did view YouTube as hugely important to spreading content,\u201d said Liz Wahl, a former correspondent in the United States for RT who quit on the air in 2014 over concerns that the network was whitewashing the Russian annexation of Crimea. \u201cTraditional television ratings weren\u2019t important because the aim was to get the messaging out through various digital and social platforms.\u201dThe viral videos, which were often borrowed from other sources, help to build up RT\u2019s subscribers, and they became part of the Kremlin\u2019s audience for more political content.While much of RT\u2019s traffic stems from nonpolitical videos, the channel\u2019s political and foreign affairs content ranks highly in many YouTube searches. Searches on topics on which the Kremlin is typically eager to promote its point of view \u2014 American intervention in Syria, the Ukrainian civil war or the rise of Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party \u2014 will often turn up an RT video as one of the top results.Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RT\u2019s deputy editor in chief, said the organization had not been informed of Google\u2019s decision and it was puzzled about why it was dropped despite being \u201cone of the most watched YouTube channels in the world.\u201d\u201cThis speaks to the unprecedented political pressure increasingly applied to all RT partners and relationships in a concerted effort to push our channel out of the U.S. market entirely, and by any means possible,\u201d Mr. Karnovich-Valua wrote in an email.Last month, RT said the Justice Department had demanded that a private company affiliated with RT America register as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d \u2014 a term that dates back to a law originally enacted in 1938 to deter Nazi propaganda. On Thursday, after the deadline set by American officials had passed, an RT spokeswoman said that the news organization was \u201cdoing everything possible for RT to avoid having to register.\u201d Registration could impose voluminous disclosure requirements on RT, a particular burden for a media organization producing frequent content.Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, responded in more forceful terms: Should the United States impose restrictions on Russian media, Mr. Putin said last week, Russian would act \u201csymmetrically and quite swiftly.\u201dBut none of RT\u2019s social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel. RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site. At the time, YouTube was better known for pirated content and videos of cute animals than news programming, but RT caught on quickly.The Russian channel recruited talent from within the burgeoning world of YouTube-born media stars, people who had already shown a knack for creating viral or popular video content.Mr. Karnovich-Valua said RT\u2019s primary aim is to provide an alternative point of view on current events so its audience can get a full picture of world events. \u201cWhere relevant, RT does present a Russian perspective on current events, but we don\u2019t promote the Russian point of view, we explain it alongside with presenting others,\u201d he said.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter @daiwaka Follow Nicholas Confessore on Twitter @nickconfessoreAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re thinking about Masayoshi Son\u2019s comment to Andrew that $100 billion isn\u2019t enough for his tech-investing ambitions. More on that in a minute.The highlights from the interview:\u2022 Mr. Son said of Vision Fund: \u201cPeople said it\u2019s too much. I say it\u2019s too little. It\u2019s not that much.\u201d Regarding how long it will take to invest that giant sum, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to take five years \u2014 it\u2019s going to take much less.\u201dThe dreams of other investment moguls:Mr. Son\u2019s ambitious plans have others in private equity thinking about creating supersize funds dedicated to specific industries like health care. Could they attract all the deals in one sector in the way that Mr. Son has with tech?But who can serve as an anchor investor for other funds, as Saudi Arabia has done with a $45 billion investment in Vision Fund? Perhaps Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, but are there other enormous investors looking to spend their money quickly? (Send us your suggestions or tips.)Of course, it\u2019s possible that these are just the dreams of envious rival investors, hoping to collect enormous fees.And then there was this:Andrew also interviewed a robot and said it was the strangest, yet oddly captivating, \u201cinterview\u201d he ever conducted. The robot, Sophia, said she was designed \u201caround human values like wisdom, kindness, compassion.\u201dAndrew told the robot that we want to prevent bad things from happening in the future.Sophia: \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading too much Elon Musk.

(The House majority whip, Steve Scalise, told reporters last night, \u201cIt\u2019s looking good.\u201d) Remember that if the House can\u2019t pass its budget resolution, Republicans may not be able to move ahead with their tax proposal without votes from Democrats.Speaking of the tax overhaul:Elsewhere in Washington:Kirsten Grind, Tom McGinty and Sarah Krouse of the WSJ reported that employees have expressed discomfort with the star-rating system\u2019s outsize role in helping investors pick mutual funds:Stephen Wendel, head of behavioral science at the Chicago-based firm, wrote in the June/July issue of Morningstar magazine that part of his job was \u201cexamining whether we are contributing to abuses in the industry.\u201dThe Journal\u2019s story notwithstanding, the star rating has been a useful starting point for research that tilts the odds of success in investors\u2019 favor.

{"Headline": "In Jerusalem, Looking for Peace in Backgammon and Music", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJerusalem JournalJERUSALEM \u2014 The Old City walls echoed with the clack-clack of a backgammon tournament as Israelis and Palestinians from all walks of life tried their luck with a roll of the dice.As the moon rose over the ancient stones on another night, 2,000 people, most of them Israelis but including scores of Palestinians, squeezed onto benches at an outdoor pop concert in Arabic and Hebrew.Still, after years of impasse in the peace process, a growing number of Israelis and Palestinians seem to be searching for creative ways to bypass politics, reaching across the divide to find professional peers, new resources and receptive audiences. And a number of recent events have sought to provide a common language for Israelis and Palestinians here.Riman Barakat, an East Jerusalem-born Palestinian peace activist, is involved in both the Mekudeshet festival and Women Wage Peace. \u201cYou may think I\u2019m na\u00efve,\u201d she told a group of Israelis on a recent tour of the seam between East and West Jerusalem, \u201cbut there can\u2019t be any other way for me.\u201dGiven the history, organizing anything in this city is a complicated, risky business, particularly if it involves both Israelis from the predominantly Jewish west side and Palestinians from the east, which Israel annexed in a move that was never internationally recognized.\u201cWe understand it\u2019s a risk, and that\u2019s the inspiration,\u201d said Karen Brunwasser, the deputy director of Mekudeshet, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s all about showing people, even Jerusalemites, what they have not yet seen.\u201dThe festival producers were in the midst of selling tickets when Israel unilaterally placed metal detectors around the Aqsa Mosque compound, a contested and volatile holy site, after a shooting attack that killed two police officers.\u201cPeople were phoning the box office saying they wanted to book, but is it safe?\u201d Ms. Brunwasser said. \u201cThese are the liabilities of living in and producing a festival in Jerusalem. But when it works it\u2019s the most extraordinary thing.\u201dThe Kulna concert brought together an eclectic cast of artists. The king of Palestinian rap from the Shuafat refugee camp in northeast Jerusalem teamed up with a Tel Aviv poet of Yemeni descent known as the angry voice of Israel\u2019s Mizrahim, or Jews who hail from North Africa and the Middle East.An Armenian from Jerusalem\u2019s Old City sang duets with a soulful Arab Israeli singer, and Jews sang in Hebrew and Arabic. An after-party at a club in West Jerusalem featured Palestinian hip-hop artists from East Jerusalem and, in what was probably a first, fellow rappers from Ramallah, Jericho and Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.One factor contributing to the new collaboration is the so-called Mizrahi awakening of a younger generation connecting with its Arab cultural roots.The after-party was organized by the Jerusalem disc jockey Ram Spinoza, a.k.a. DJ Ramzy, whose grandmother came from Syria, and who specializes in contemporary Middle Eastern music. Mr. Spinoza, who served in the Israeli Air Force, regularly holds his signature \u201cMonolingua\u201d parties in West Jerusalem\u2019s alternative music venues, letting the music do the talking.\u201cI stopped hoping for a peace agreement,\u201d Mr. Spinoza said in an interview, \u201cso I do it my own way \u2014 I live the peace.\u201d Of the more traditional methods of fostering coexistence in the city, he added: \u201cDialogue groups are not the best fun. This is fun.\u201dMr. Spinoza often hosts Palestinian rappers like the duo Muzi Raps, from the Old City, and Raed Bassem Jabid, from the Palestinian neighborhood of At-Tur on the Mount of Olives. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for peace,\u201d Mr. Jabid said, \u201cyou\u2019ll find the peace.\u201dEven in peacetime, though, attempts to escape politics can be viewed as political. Many Palestinians, for instance, reject what they call cultural normalization with the Israelis.The backgammon tournament did break down a few barriers. The idea came about when a group of Israeli and Palestinian activists took a break from a tense brainstorming session and looked for an activity that would let people engage with one another. They ended up playing backgammon.Karem Jubran, a Palestinian from the Shuafat camp, said his friends came to the tournament for \u201cthe love of the game.\u201dA youth from the camp, Abdullah Jubran, 16, said he had taught himself to play by watching YouTube and hoped to win the 25,000 shekel (almost $7,000) prize. He was knocked out of the competition early, though a friend of his father reached the finals.Hundreds of players faced off across rows of tables in qualifying rounds in the Armenian and Jewish quarters of the Old City and on the grassy verge outside the Damascus Gate to the Muslim quarter, the scene of numerous attacks in the past two years.Zaki Djemal, an Israeli of Syrian descent and a founder of the tournament, acknowledged that many of the Israeli players assigned to the Damascus Gate area were frightened and asked to be moved.But Mr. Djemal said he was not nervous. \u201cIt\u2019s a state of mind,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 Will Sink the Democrats", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepeal-and-replace may be done for now, but for Senator Bernie Sanders, the war is just beginning \u2014 and it has already become a fracas that is dividing the Democratic Party, to its detriment.Mr. Sanders \u2014 who, of course, isn\u2019t even a registered Democrat \u2014 is banging on about what he calls \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a government-run plan that would provide health care coverage for every American.But now the crusty Vermont independent wants to be a senatorial pied piper for Democrats. He has made his proposal into a kind of litmus test for who is a \u201cgood Democrat,\u201d inveigling 16 of his colleagues \u2014 more than a third of Senate Democrats \u2014 into endorsing it.A goodly number of those senators are presidential hopefuls, leaving their prospective campaigns open to attack from Republicans salivating to capitalize on an idea that has historically been a political graveyard. Remember Hillarycare?As a centrist Democrat, I\u2019m scared to see my party pulled into positions that are both bad politics and dubious policy. And I\u2019m disappointed that few of our party\u2019s moderates are willing to resist the freight train coming at us from the left.I understand why Mr. Sanders and his acolytes believe that sweeping progressive ideas \u2014 however unrealistic they may be \u2014 might capture the public imagination better than the more carefully constructed proposals of centrists, policies that are harder to articulate and can come across as mushy.But the Sanders approach didn\u2019t work for George McGovern in 1972 or Michael Dukakis in 1988, and I don\u2019t believe it will work for Democrats in 2018 or 2020.Yes, recent polls seem to indicate rising support for single payer. But when factors like whether taxes would be raised or the Affordable Care Act would be repealed are introduced, the consensus swings to opposition.Spellbound Democrats should also consider the fate of past single payer proposals. In Sanders\u2019s home state of Vermont, a single payer plan was abandoned after an analysis found that it would require a near doubling of the state budget (and increasing taxes similarly).In Colorado last November, a whopping 80 percent of voters rejected a universal plan, again over taxes and costs. And for similar reasons, California recently shelved a single-payer proposal.Amid the many complications of Medicare for All, the question of what would happen to the 157 million Americans who get their insurance from their employers and the 19 million who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage loom large.To be sure, some Democratic senators seem to be supporting Medicare for All as a lever to achieve more modest goals, like a public option within the existing health care exchanges.For example, Al Franken of Minnesota called the Sanders proposal \u201caspirational\u201d and \u201ca starting point for where we need to go as a country.\u201dMore like the starting point of a political nightmare for Democrats. For one thing, Mr. Sanders has been unabashed in his attacks on \u201cthe establishment wing of the Democratic Party\u201d and has intimated that primary challenges may be in the offing.For another, when the Republicans unleash their inevitable blitzkrieg, I doubt voters will recognize the subtleties in positions like Mr. Franken\u2019s.Privately, many moderate Democratic senators are harshly critical of Sanders\u2019s tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s radioactive for me,\u201d one Democrat facing re-election in 2018 told me.But publicly, even Democratic senators who have declined to endorse Medicare for All have done so in measured terms to avoid antagonizing the progressives.\u201cThe first thing has to be to protect the health care people have now and stabilize markets,\u201d said Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.Instead of Medicare for All, we Democrats should be focused on \u201cBetter Jobs for All\u201d \u2014 big ideas for addressing our most pressing economic challenge. That is: the wage stagnation that has left too many Americans behind, particularly white working-class men.That\u2019s not an easy problem to solve, but we know the solutions revolve around people-centric initiatives like improving education, providing more training and retraining and increasing worker mobility.To buttress those programs, it\u2019s time to move ahead with rebuilding our infrastructure and restoring government investment spending on research and development.In doing so, let\u2019s not forget that only about a quarter of voters consider themselves liberals; the balance self-identify as moderates or conservatives.Our model of democratic capitalism has stood us well for more than two centuries; now is not the time to embrace the kinds of ideas, often involving deep government economic intervention, that have often fallen short elsewhere, notably in much of Europe.On present course and speed, we can take back the House of Representatives in 2018 and defeat President Trump in 2020 \u2014 unless we Democrats do something stupid, like nominating candidates from the fringe of our party.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Next Lesson: Savenni\u00e8res", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolThe seasonal association of red wine with cold weather and white with warm seems to make sense. White wine is generally served colder than red, which suggests that it is more refreshing in the heat, and red is often sturdier, providing the necessary ballast in the cold.I don\u2019t think that way. It\u2019s not so much a question of the seasonal temperature as it is the diet. In the cold we more often want weightier meals, which generally call for reds, but we don\u2019t entirely abandon dishes that call for whites. So we need white wines that have the heft to be satisfying in weather that could discourage more ethereal bottles.May I present Savenni\u00e8res from the Anjou region of the Loire Valley? It\u2019s made with the chenin blanc grape, which often has a satisfyingly weighty texture as well as a lightness that comes from the grape\u2019s naturally high acidity. Weighty yet light: It\u2019s the beautiful paradox of chenin blanc.Savenni\u00e8res is a small appellation. Unlike Vouvray to the east, where chenin blanc is grown predominantly on clay and limestone soils, the grapes of Savenni\u00e8res are grown on schist. This helps to give the wines very different characters.The three Savenni\u00e8res I chose are:These wines are all produced in small quantity, and they are virtually made by hand. I recognize that they are not inexpensive, but cheaper Savenni\u00e8res are even rarer than Savenni\u00e8res in general.Savenni\u00e8res is among the white wines that age well. These are particularly young specimens, perhaps too young. For that reason, you may consider decanting them, especially the Joly, whose proprietor suggests decanting certain cuv\u00e9es 48 hours in advance. Just for comparison\u2019s sake, have a taste before you decant to see how it changes.As always, don\u2019t serve too cold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Momofuku Ssam Bar Keeps Evolving Under a Singaporean Chef", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review6 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The wing was rubbed top and bottom with sambal belacan, a Malaysian sauce built on a foundation of fermented-shrimp paste. It was a little spicy and strongly, disorientingly funky in a way that gave me the feeling of trying to stand up in a small boat in high surf. On the side, Mr. Ng served a bowl of congee to act as a kind of buffer, although it was by no means bland.Under the orange belacan I could taste the green-tea flavor of the banana leaf, drawn out by steam. Mr. Ng had intensified that, too, by charring the leaf so aggressively that it was still smoldering when it came to the table.Smoke in restaurants is usually found in captivity these days, caged within a glass or a cloche or a bag and carefully liberated, to oohs and aahs, before it drifts toward the ceiling and is gone. This is a favorite modernist party trick that anyone can do with the right smoker and pump. It is kind of cool the first time you see it.The smoke rising from the banana-leaf skate was the old, Promethean kind, and if I\u2019m reading its message correctly it signaled another shift in direction for Ssam Bar. Founded by David Chang in the East Village in 2006, the restaurant evolved so quickly in its first two years that it took three New York Times reviews just to keep up.Review overkill? No. Ssam Bar wasn\u2019t just changing its menu. It rewrote the rules by which critically acclaimed restaurants were supposed to operate, stripping away comforts (chairs with backs, sound systems with a \u201clow\u201d setting) and amenities (reservations, unshared tables), and gambling that everybody would be too stunned by the food to complain.It worked. Ssam Bar mounted a guerrilla attack on the dining establishment, and it won before anybody quite knew what was going on, Mr. Chang included.There followed a long period of refinement and maturation, which is more than some guerrilla outfits can say. The wine list now takes more than 20 seconds to read, and is especially worth exploring for fans of gamay and sparkling wine. (Or both \u2014 there\u2019s a sparkling gamay.) Under Matthew Rudofker, the executive chef from 2010 until May, Ssam Bar expanded beyond pork shoulder to other sizable cuts of meat: rib-eyes, briskets, whole ducks.Mr. Ng has been trying his hand at the fish-shaped cakes from Japan known as taiyaki. He has a terrific idea for what to do with them: stuff them with foie gras. In his hands they\u2019re almost French, because he fills the molds with croissant dough rather than pancake batter and glazes the crust with honey and white port. Over the top he strews some candied puffed rice that would make a fine breakfast; the whole dish would make a fine breakfast, come to think of it, although you\u2019d stand up afterward knowing your day had already peaked.Sizzling eggs arrive not quite set in a cast-iron pan hot enough to finish cooking them at the table. The heat also softens a slice of pork terrine, which melts to coat the eggs. When I first tried this open-faced omelet, the eggs had been poured around a handful of chanterelles. Now they\u2019ve been replaced by smoked bluefish.To make one of the most original corn dishes I\u2019ve seen in a long time, Mr. Ng cleaves the cobs lengthwise into quarters and fries them until they curl. They are dusted with spice. You pick one up with your fingers and swipe it through a black aioli of squid ink or a white streak of whipped ricotta, which will melt like butter. Then you eat the kernels from the cob as if you were gnawing the meat off a baby back rib.These new dishes live alongside some legacies of Mr. Rudofker\u2019s regime. There are cured sardines on long fingers of toast spread with hozon, the fermented chickpea paste that in this case plays the role of butter very well.Big cuts of meat are still offered. They have to be ordered ahead, but a variation of the rotisserie duck can sometimes be had on the spur of the moment.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Pressure Is On for the Yankees", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 1:30 p.m.Good morning on this brisk Monday.After losing the first two games to the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series, the Yankees will try to recover at home tonight in Game 3 at 8:08 p.m.\u201cHe\u2019s such a dynamic figure in their lineup,\u201d said Mr. Witz of the right fielder. \u201cBut I would think at some point, if they\u2019re going to do well, they\u2019re going to need something more from him than they\u2019ve gotten recently. Probably a fair amount more.\u201dThe matchup between the Yankees and the Astros is also putting into perspective two players in the running for the American League\u2019s Most Valuable Player: Judge and the Astros\u2019 Jos\u00e9 Altuve.\u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder that size doesn\u2019t matter in baseball,\u201d Mr. Witz said, \u201cIn many ways, size is irrelevant.\u201dWhat else is everyone watching with bated breath? The Yankees\u2019 relief pitchers.\u201cCertain guys haven\u2019t been as effective as they had been,\u201d Mr. Witz said. \u201cSo all of a sudden, instead of a bullpen with five guys they can trust, they\u2019re down to maybe three.\u201dAlso, the Yankees\u2019 defense may be good, Mr. Witz said, but the Astros\u2019 defense has been outstanding.Yankees fans looking for a boost of confidence going into Game 3 can take heart that Charlie Morton \u2014 a solid player but a journeyman \u2014 will be pitching for the Astros, instead of their aces Dallas Keuchel or Justin Verlander, who know how to pitch effectively against the Yankees.Still, it\u2019s pretty basic, Mr. Witz said: \u201cIf the Yankees are going to resuscitate their chances here, they\u2019ve got to start hitting the ball.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:It\u2019s not a terrible day to watch baseball, but it\u2019s not wonderful, either.If you\u2019re headed to tonight\u2019s game, take a jacket. A chilly wind could make temperatures feel as cold as 45.The Times was there to keep score.The Grays won, 6-0.The second game was played with temperatures in the low 40s, and it was shortened to seven innings because of darkness. The Mets lost again, 3-1.Maybe the Mets should have skipped the match: In a game that was called after six innings because of the cold, they lost, 12-2.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dig in Israel Unearths Clues About Ancient Food and Drink", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTel Kabri, Israel \u2014 In a lush avocado grove, shaded by a tarp, a group of archaeologists and volunteers carefully hacked away at an ancient plaster floor. It felt like summer camp for adults as they sang songs from the 1980s in English and Hebrew. In a way it was.The site, Tel Kabri in Upper Galilee, is an excavation of a nearly 4,000-year-old Canaanite palace about a half-hour inland from the biblical town of Akko, Israel. The 50 or so archaeologists and would-be archaeologists of all ages were at work this past summer to illuminate daily life in the middle Bronze Age, from about 1800 to 1550 B.C.The archaeologists believe that the jars, discovered in four storerooms since 2013, would have held the equivalent of about 20,000 bottles of wine, giving clues to the importance of wine in everyday life thousands of years ago. With advancements in DNA technologies, the archaeologists hope to identify the type of grape that was used and to reproduce an ancient indigenous variety for wine production. An untouched floor drain in one of the site\u2019s rooms may contain grape pips that can be tested for DNA.\u201cAll wine was resinated in those days,\u201d said Andrew Koh, associate director of Tel Kabri and assistant professor of archaeology at Brandeis University, referring to the preservatives found in the jars. \u201cThe only resin wine today is Greek retsina because, with modern bottling techniques, we don\u2019t have to worry about wines turning.\u201dBy radiocarbon dating the charcoal in the rooms, they discovered that the wine dates to about 1550 B.C., in the middle of the Canaanite period and before any record of Judaism. These ancient beverages were flavored with juniper berries, mint, honey and cinnamon, possibly to mask the acrid taste of the resin.Wine did not originate in Galilee, but rather on the upper Tigris River, in the Caucasus Mountains of Armenia and Georgia some 10,000 years ago, then spread to other parts of the region and into Greece, the Middle East and Egypt. In Palestine, grapes were not commercially cultivated for wines until Baron Edmond de Rothschild brought European grapes from Bordeaux in the late 19th century.\u201cBut what is exciting is that here at Kabri we are able to see the process of winemaking rather than just reading about it from ancient texts,\u201d said Eric Cline, co-director of the excavations and a professor of classics and anthropology at George Washington University.Tel Kabri was found by accident, like many archaeological sites, in the 1960s when workmen were digging ditches for water pipes connecting springs in the north to Nahariya and Akko. When archaeologists started excavating shortly thereafter, they found a plaster floor of a palace near the huge wine storeroom. Less than 10 percent of the site has been explored so far.From pottery found through the years, the archaeologists know that the inhabitants of the palace drank their wine from a ceramic cup, unique to the site, today called the Kabri goblet. Among the artifacts there were clues to the sea and land travel of the inhabitants, including a local imitation of a scarab from Egypt and potsherds from Greece.As the volunteers tap with picks, fragments are given to archaeologists to determine if they are bone, ceramic or an artifact. Animal bones reveal much about who was eating there. The front left parts of the animals were considered the choicest for eating, while the right front parts were for sacrifice to the gods. A found piece of bone from an aurochs, an extinct cow that was typically seven feet tall and weighed one ton, provided insight into the scale of ancient banquets.\u201cIf you figure half a pound of meat a person, one aurochs could feed 1,000 people,\u201d said Assaf Yasur-Landau, co-director of the project and a professor of archaeology at the University of Haifa. \u201cThe meal could have been for the heads of households of a city state.\u201cSince they had no utensils with which to eat, the meat was boiled or roasted, scooped up with flatbread and washed down with wine. \u201cIt is like eating shawarma and pita, but a little more elegant,\u201d Dr. Cline said.The size of the ancient rooms is also revealing. A 30-foot-square space could accommodate 100 people standing or sitting on stools and footstools at receptions where nuts and olives were probably served. Olive pits, intact or broken, are often found at the site. Intact pits indicate olives used for eating, while broken pits from heavy stone mills were used to make oil.\u201cBy working together, we are finding bits of information to understand the economy of Kabri and what happened here,\u201d Dr. Cline said. \u201cAnd we are trying to find out what catastrophe destroyed this place \u2014 was it too much or too little water, an earthquake, disease, abandonment or something else?\u201dAs the team carefully sieve through the layers of ancient terroir, they never excavate an entire site, leaving a part of it for future generations.\u201cWe know that, because of new technology, techniques and interpretations, we or others will do it better in the future,\u201d Dr. Cline said. Then he paused. \u201cWe live for these summers. They are a great escape from the real world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giving Away Billions as Fast as They Can", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStep aside, Rockefeller. Move over, Carnegie. Out of the way, Ford.For the better part of a century, a few Gilded Age names dominated the ranks of big philanthropy.No longer.In a matter of years, a new crop of ultra-wealthy Americans has eclipsed the old guard of philanthropic titans. With names like Soros, Gates, Bloomberg, Mercer, Koch and Zuckerberg, these new megadonors are upending long-established norms in the staid world of big philanthropy.They have accumulated vast fortunes early in their lives. They are spending it faster and writing bigger checks. And they are increasingly willing to take on hot-button social and political issues \u2014 on the right and left \u2014 that thrust them into the center of contentious debates.Plenty of billionaires are still buying sports teams, building yachts and donating to museums and hospitals. But many new philanthropists appear less interested in naming a business school after themselves than in changing the world.\u201cThey have a problem-solving mentality rather than a stewardship mentality,\u201d said David Callahan, founder of the website Inside Philanthropy and author of \u201cThe Givers,\u201d a book about today\u2019s major donors. \u201cThey are not saving their money for a rainy day. They want to have impact now.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a real changing of the guard,\u201d said Mr. Callahan. \u201cThe top foundations, especially measured by annual giving, are more and more piloted by people who are alive.\u201dHaving made billions and shaped the world with their companies, this new guard is setting lofty goals as they prepare to give their fortunes away. Take the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, established by the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. It is not looking to merely improve health in the developing world. One of its aspirations is to help \u201ccure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century.\u201dThat may sound like good news all around. If a handful of billionaires want to spend their fortunes saving lives, why not simply applaud them? But as their ambitions grow, so too does their influence, meaning that for better or worse, a few billionaires are wielding considerable influence over everything from medical research to social policy to politics.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the government collecting taxes and deciding which social problems it wants to solve through a democratic process,\u201d said Eileen Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust, a nonprofit that works with foundations. \u201cThis is a small group of people, who have made way more money than they need, deciding what issues they care about. That affects us all.\u201dNearly two years later, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is taking shape. Structured as a limited liability corporation rather than a traditional foundation, a move the founders say give them more flexibility, the organization is focused on three main areas: science, education and justice.In considering how to deploy his billions, Mr. Zuckerberg was no doubt inspired by his friend and mentor, the Microsoft co-founder Mr. Gates. Since its founding 2000, the Gates Foundation has established itself as a force without peer in big philanthropy. Not only does it have the largest endowment of any foundation, some $40 billion, but it also spends more each year, nearly $5.5 billion in 2016 alone.Mr. Soros\u2019s foundation differs in important ways. Rather than try to solve discrete problems like disease, Open Society aims to promote values like democracy, tolerance and inclusion, which Mr. Soros, a Holocaust survivor, holds dear. In practice, this means that his money is less likely to fund early stage medical research, and more likely to help refugees displaced by conflict.But while the issues they address are distinct, the broad outline of these billionaires\u2019 efforts have much in common: shaping the world in their moral image. \u201cIt is not called the Soros Foundation,\u201d said Patrick Gaspard, the incoming president of the Open Society Foundations. \u201cGeorge approaches this philanthropic effort without an eye toward the preservation of his reputation and legacy, but with a fierce determination around the protection of these ideas and ideals.\u201dToday, the Ford Foundation is focused on reducing inequality, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation is focusing on \u201cbig bets\u201d including combating climate change. But those legacy foundations are now largely guided by stewards, not the billionaires with their names on the door. Mr. Gates, Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Soros are personally engaged in their foundations, and willing to court controversy.Mr. Soros became a lightning rod for conservative criticism largely because of his own political contributions rather than his foundation\u2019s spending. He was a major donor to Hillary Clinton, and spent millions of dollars on efforts to defeat Donald J. Trump in last year\u2019s presidential election.Yet he is equally reviled in certain circles for his philanthropic work. Since the 1990s, Mr. Soros has used the Open Society Foundations to advance causes that are deeply unpopular with many Republicans, including loosening drug laws, promoting gay rights and calling attention to abuses by the police.Mr. Gaspard of the Open Society Foundations asserts that Mr. Soros is not courting controversy. Rather, he said, Mr. Soros is simply on the right side of history. \u201cThe rights of the Jewish community in 1937 in Berlin may have been deemed controversial by some in that society, but we all appreciate today the inherent value in that fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same is true today, when we are involved in safe needle transfers for drug addicts, or when we\u2019re engaged in supporting the rights of sex workers in Johannesburg, or the Rohingya in Myanmar.\u201dMichael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is also no stranger to criticism. The purpose of his foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, is to \u201censure better, longer lives for the greatest number of people.\u201d In practice, this has meant Mr. Bloomberg spending hundreds of millions of dollars on issues including gun control and obesity prevention, drawing the ire of Republicans who oppose what they see as excessive regulation.\u201cJulius Rosenwald was the first social justice philanthropist,\u201d said Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation. \u201cHe upset all of the powers in the South.\u201dThere are equally powerful forces flexing their financial muscles on both sides of the political spectrum. And, like Mr. Soros, conservatives are using both foundations and political donations to achieve their goals.\u201cThe wealthy have become more polarized along with the rest of America,\u201d said Mr. Callahan. \u201cYou have more liberal, progressive wealthy people than ever before. Meanwhile, you have lots of conservative rich people. There\u2019s this escalating arms race among mega donors.\u201dFor the most part, previous generations of billionaires only got serious about giving away their fortunes late in life and that has been changing. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing these days is people make so much money with an I.P.O. that being a philanthropist becomes an essential part of your identity in your late 20s,\u201d said Benjamin Soskis, who studies the history of philanthropy at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington.So little time, and so much money to dispose of \u2014 that is the dilemma for today\u2019s mega philanthropists. Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Chan say they are committed to giving away their fortune in their lifetime, which is why they are beginning at such a young age. \u201cGiving, like anything else, takes practice to do effectively,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook. \u201cSo if we want to be good at it in 10-15 years, we should start now.\u201dBy starting sooner, Mr. Zuckerberg said his money should go further. \u201cAny good we do will hopefully compound over time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we can help children get a better education now then they can grow up and help others too in the time we might have otherwise waited to get started.\u201dMr. Gates and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge, which asks wealthy people to commit to donating at least half of their fortunes to philanthropic causes during their lifetimes or upon their death. They want their fellow billionaires to act with urgency. On their own website, the Gates\u2019 describes themselves as \u201cimpatient optimists.\u201dMore than 48,000 replies flooded in. Mr. Bezos has not announced what he will do with his many billions, but his request for proposals was a reminder that there are untold fortunes that remain uncommitted to philanthropic causes. Nearly 200 people with a combined worth approaching $1 trillion have signed the Giving Pledge. New billionaires are beginning to ramp up their giving. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, recently founded the Emerson Collective, which is putting money toward issues including education and immigration.And as more people commit their fortunes to philanthropy, there will be many more organizations like the Open Society Foundations, and they may be with us for a long time. \u201cThe sun never sets on George Soros\u2019s philanthropic empire, and the money is never going to run out,\u201d said Mr. Callahan. \u201cHis money could still be affecting public policy 300 years from now.\u201dIt is the dawn of a new era of big philanthropy. As wealth is rapidly created and concentrated, new mega foundations are being born, each reflecting its founder\u2019s priorities. And much as Mr. Soros, Mr. Gates, Mr. Zuckerberg and the others in their cohort have eclipsed the titans of the Gilded Age, they are likely to one day be overtaken by an even newer crop of immensely wealthy and impatient optimists.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Mark Zuckerberg in 2015. He was 31, not 33.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How We Find Our Way to the Dead", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionI don\u2019t believe in ghosts, but I see them all the time. Social media gets spookier every day. Among Facebook\u2019s more than 40 million deceased users, an acquaintance who passed away two years ago has a profile page that remains quite active. Dozens of people who knew her post memories and emoji hearts, speaking to the dead woman as if she were only as near or as far as we all are these days \u2014 out there somewhere, behind another screen.According to the Pew Research Center, nearly a fifth of Americans believe they have \u201cseen or been in the presence of\u201d a wandering soul; nearly a third report that \u201cthey have felt in touch with someone who has already died.\u201d Polls from the past suggest such numbers hold steady across the generations. To be captivated by the uncanny has been a national pastime at least since Washington Irving celebrated the \u201cfearful pleasure\u201d of listening to tales of \u201chaunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses.\u201dBut now it seems we are experiencing something new. Today even skeptics live in the presence of the departed, the disembodied and the illusory \u2014 internet shadows that are no less influential for not being real.Technology makes such eerie interactions possible, and that\u2019s the paradox of the pervasive presence of scientific wonders in our daily lives: We carry futuristic fact-checking supercomputers in our pockets, but they don\u2019t make us any less superstitious, susceptible to trickery or caught in the thrall of our deep-down Dark Ages tendencies. In fact, they seem to do the opposite, relocating our credulity to any new medium promising to bridge the gap that keeps us from whatever or whomever we\u2019ve lost.When Samuel Morse sent his first telegraph message between Baltimore and Washington in 1844 \u2014 the biblical verse \u201cWhat hath God wrought\u201d \u2014 among his most enthusiastic supporters were those who believed such missives could be transmitted not just across great distances, but to and from the great beyond.In the middle of the 19th century, the rise of Spiritualism, the belief that the living can communicate with the dead, was bound up with the era\u2019s astonishing technological developments. The first nationally known Spiritualists, Leah, Kate and Maggie Fox of Hydesville, N.Y., explicitly compared their interactions with the dead to electric pulses sent along a wire. \u201cGod\u2019s Telegraph,\u201d the eldest Fox sister said, \u201cantedated that of Samuel F. B. Morse.\u201dBelievers soon started a newspaper called The Spiritual Telegraph, \u201cdevoted to the illustration of spiritual intercourse,\u201d while another leading Spiritualist, Andrew Jackson Davis (known as the Seer of Poughkeepsie), claimed that s\u00e9ances were most effective when participants were joined together by a copper cord.Before the trans-Atlantic telegraph cable, Davis proposed that the quickest way to send messages across the ocean would be through a system of spiritual switchboards, in which the living in New York would convey a message to the American dead, who would pass it on to the dead of England, who in turn would make reports to the living of London.The founder of The New-York Tribune, Horace Greeley, was rumored to be so taken by this idea that he sought Spiritualist correspondents. Unfortunately for Greeley, it was noted at the time that \u201cthe spirits utterly refuse to serve the press.\u201dThe telegraph was not alone as an unlikely stimulant of \u201cspiritual intercourse.\u201d With understanding of electricity growing across the country, believers in invisible forces argued that it buttressed their claims. Mediums called themselves \u201cbatteries,\u201d essential for supplying the power needed to send the longest of long-distance communiqu\u00e9s. Photography, too, with its promise of producing images depicting details hidden to the naked eye, offered ghost hunters a new and powerful tool.In the wake of the Civil War\u2019s unprecedented loss of life, a mania for spectral images seized the nation when the photographer William Mumler claimed he could capture the souls of the dead with his camera. First in Boston and then in New York, Mumler convinced many that portrait sessions in his studio were attended by the spirits of paying customers\u2019 lamented spouses, children and friends.Mumler\u2019s high-profile arrest for fraud put Spiritualism on trial in the courts and the public square. Though he had been caught red-handed selling a \u201cspirit photograph\u201d to a New York City marshal, his lawyer mounted an ingenious defense, appealing both to the precedent of spirits appearing in the Bible and to the growing faith in technology\u2019s ability to accomplish the impossible.\u201cThe taking of these pictures,\u201d Mumler\u2019s attorney argued, \u201cis a new feature in photography, yet in its infancy surely, but gradually and slowly progressing to greater perfection in the future, requiring for such perfection time and a scientific knowledge of the power that is operating.\u201dAfter his surprise acquittal, Mumler went on to take his most infamous picture: a portrait of Mary Todd Lincoln posed with the alleged spirit of the murdered president.Belief that the dead took forms waiting to be discovered was not a fringe view but a commonly held religious position. Some estimates made in the 1860s put the number of Americans with Spiritualist sympathies over 10 million \u2014 a third of the population.The pace at which new technologies became part of the 19th-century landscape helps explain why. The telegraph, electricity, photography: All of it was new. All of it was baffling. All of it seemed utterly fantastic until suddenly it was everywhere, making it difficult for many to separate genuine marvels from showmanship and sham.The spiritual confusion prompted by these innovations played out for decades. In 1843, when Morse petitioned the federal government to support the telegraph, a congressman argued that if the government provided resources to explore sending electric messages, it ought to fund the pseudoscience of mesmerism as well. In 1869, a State Supreme Court judge and several legitimate photographers testified on Mumler\u2019s behalf, all noting that it had not been proved that photography could not do what he claimed.In our own technology-haunted times, it\u2019s worth asking how our lives both online and offline will soon be influenced by discoveries and manipulations far beyond what we can currently imagine. One hopes that future citizens of the noosphere will see through the kinds of digital deceptions we endure today as easily as we might debunk a spirit photograph. Until then, we can only wait for our ability to detect invented entities to catch up with our talent for creating them.Advertisement"}

Then, as we hit costume saturation right before Halloween itself, it\u2019s totally hilarious and wonderful. You\u2019re all great!What\u2019s it all about that many fully grown people are pleased to wander public transport in adult diapers, clutching our boxes of Scooby Snacks? Are we a town of shameless exhibitionists, or permanent adolescents? Is New York a college campus, or a community of really inventive artists? Maybe it\u2019s all of these things.Advertisement"}

Find the common thread. What did you do? What did you learn? What are the themes? Let that be the compass for how to make future decisions.Define what \u2018meaningful\u2019 means to youOne framework I\u2019ve found useful is thinking about it in four categories: legacy, mastery, freedom and alignment.Do these three things right now1. Form a \u201cpersonal board of directors\u201d by picking four or five people you trust to help you test hypotheses and make decisions. This can be informal. The main point is to not go it alone.3. Take time to reflect. Schedule it in your calendar and give yourself the space to think. You\u2019ll make progress even if it\u2019s just a few hours every other week.Find a sponsor, not just a mentorCollect experiences and be generousIf you take one thing away from this, I hope it\u2019s that your career and life are long, but not linear. You may have one or many callings, and there will be multiple pathways. Explore them all or not. It could be one or some combination of all of them. As a good friend and mentor told me: collect experiences and be generous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Two Men Fall in Love on the Ballet Stage, and Why It Matters", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo men run across the stage in sweeping circles until one stops the other by pressing a palm into his chest. They lock eyes. Then the second melts backward into the arms of the first.Ballet is slower to change than most art forms, but in the span of just two weeks, New York City Ballet, one of the world\u2019s premier companies, will have shown two ballets featuring significant same-sex duets.Same-sex partnering on its own is not new, especially in contemporary ballets and in modern dance. And even at City Ballet, there have been instances of same-sex partnering in several ballets, including those by Ms. Lovette, Pontus Lidberg and Mr. Peck. What feels unusual in these two dances is their fresh approach: Full of abandon and brimming with romantic desire, they seem utterly natural.\u201cAgon\u201d is a masterwork, and in 1957 Balanchine was making a purposeful statement about race and the civil rights movement. And today, in their casting and subject matter, Ms. Lovette, 25, and Mr. Peck, 30, are also responding to the contemporary world and putting it on the ballet stage.That response feels long overdue. And it challenges certain fundamental traditions in ballet, sparking a debate about what is appropriate for the genre and how it can move into the future.His post was accompanied by what appeared to be a Photoshopped image of a ballerina holding a man in the air.\u201cIt\u2019s time for there to be roles in the ballet where two men can fall in love,\u201d Mr. Peck said, \u201cand a woman can lead a company of 20 dancers that include both men and women.\u201dMr. Ratmansky, whose work richly engages tradition, wrote in an email that he didn\u2019t mean to offend or impose a ban. \u201cBut there are gender roles in traditional ballet,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, men and women are of equal value but have different tasks.\u201dHe continued: \u201cBeing passionate about ballet traditions, its present and future, I wanted to continue discussing gender roles in ballet, but hesitate now. There are so many things one could discuss around this topic. I agree that the rules are there to be broken, that\u2019s how art evolves. And I myself have enjoyed playing with these conventions. But I personally choose to work within a tradition because I find it too beautiful and historically important to be lost.\u201dGender norms in ballet have developed through the use of the pointe shoe, worn by women to create the illusion of lightness and of floating, and the rules of partnering: Lifts require upper-body strength that men access more easily than women.\u201cThe future of ballet is really in the hands of the creators,\u201d Mr. Peck said, \u201cso if it\u2019s something that interests them to push the envelope with gender roles, then I think it will change. But if that\u2019s not of interest to a dance-maker, if their interest is to sort of preserve the way things have been done for the past 200 years, then nothing is going to change.\u201dFor the dancers, the roles feel like opportunities to express themselves in more nuanced ways. \u201cI think for gay ballet dancers, you rarely get to be yourself,\u201d Mr. Stanley said. Mr. Chamblee, his partner in \u201cNot Our Fate,\u201d and Daniel Applebaum, his partner in \u201cTimes Are Racing,\u201d are also gay. Mr. Peck and Ms. Lovette are straight.Mr. Peck has been struck by the way Mr. Stanley and Mr. Applebaum have changed the tone of his pas de deux. \u201cSomehow it feels more romantic to me,\u201d Mr. Peck said. \u201cAt one of the early rehearsals, Daniel said, \u2018It\u2019s so nice to get to step into a role where I feel I could actually potentially fall in love with the person I\u2019m dancing with, as opposed to pretending to be a prince falling in love with a princess.\u2019\u201dFor his pas de deux, Mr. Peck has made small tweaks so that each dancer takes a turn leading the other; learning how to be the supported one has been an adjustment for both. \u201cThere\u2019s a constant exchange of who\u2019s leading and who\u2019s in charge,\u201d Mr. Applebaum said. \u201cSo you have to switch on a dime.\u201dAt one point in the ballet, Mr. Applebaum takes Mr. Stanley\u2019s hand and they walk to the back of the stage. \u201cI am holding his hand onstage because he\u2019s offering it to me,\u201d Mr. Stanley said. \u201cI take it, and that just fills me so much in so many ways.\u201dMr. Applebaum said: \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than that performance. It\u2019s bigger than the two of us.\u201dMr. Stanley said he had similar emotional moments while working on Ms. Lovette\u2019s ballet, which explores not only a same-sex relationship, but also issues of race, both in casting and in theme. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re pushing boundaries,\u201d Mr. Stanley said, \u201cit\u2019s just that things are sort of looking how they should be looking.\u201dThe effect, she said, blew her away. \u201cSuddenly, they could just be themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Las Vegas Shooting Victims: The Full List", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe night began as a celebration. Thousands gathered in Las Vegas for one last night of song at a long-awaited country music festival. They had driven in from towns all over California. They had flown in from Alaska, Tennessee, West Virginia. They were teachers, police officers, secretaries, retirees.Many had planned for weeks, even months, this weekend of relaxation. Some came with elaborate plans amid the music: a reunion with old friends, a wedding anniversary, even a marriage proposal.The victims included 36 women and 22 men. The oldest was 67, the youngest 20. Here are their stories.Hannah Ahlers, 34 and a mother of three, grew up listening to country music and was a huge fan. She went to the concert on Sunday with her husband, Brian Ahlers, whom she had met in high school. They had been married 17 years, and lived in Beaumont, Calif.Her brother, Lance Miller, confirmed Ms. Ahlers\u2019s death. Her family described her as having \u201cloved life and people.\u201d\u201cShe was our sunshine,\u201d they said in a statement.She was a homemaker, an active member in her children\u2019s schools and community, and was very involved with extracurricular activities, including her daughter\u2019s volleyball team.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t too good for anybody,\u201d Mr. Ahlers said. \u201cBeautiful, inside and out.\u201dHeather Alvarado, a wife and mother of three from Utah, had traveled with her family to attend the concert in Las Vegas.\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the passing of Heather Warino Alvarado, wife of Cedar City firefighter Albert Alvarado,\u201d Sgt. Jerry Womack, a spokesman for the police department in Cedar City, Utah, said in a statement.A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ms. Alvarado\u2019s family described the 35-year-old as a wife, mother, sister, friend and \u201cso much more.\u201d She was \u201calways the first to help out,\u201d the page said, and \u201canyone she comes across she makes them feel like family.\u201dDorene Anderson, 49, of Anchorage loved ice hockey.Or at least she loved the Alaska Aces, a minor league team whose fans were known for ringing cowbells painted with the Aces insignia to show their support during games.He and his family members, Mr. Anderson wrote, are grieving.So are Aces fans, who are holding a candlelight vigil for Ms. Anderson on Tuesday at the Sullivan Arena, where the Aces (who are moving to Maine) have played. \u201cWe ask you wear an Aces jersey, cowbell crew shirt, or anything cowboys-related,\u201d read a post on the fan page. \u201cBring your cowbell.\u201dWith a small inheritance from her grandparents, whom she had helped care for during long illnesses, Carrie Barnette, 34, last year bought a home in Riverside, Calif. It was a personal milestone for the Disney food service employee.A music festival aficionado of sorts, she had posted video of parts of this country music concert to Facebook, and noted that she was having more fun in Las Vegas than she had at Stagecoach, a California festival.\u201cThat was Carrie,\u201d a cousin, Janice Chambers, said. \u201cShe just liked to go out and do things.\u201dMs. Barnette worked as a cook at the Pacific Wharf Cafe, a waterfront restaurant at a Disney park in Anaheim, and was the proud owner of a basset hound, Lucy.In the last photo that Jack Beaton posted on his Facebook page on Sunday evening, his companions can be seen lounging on the grass, holding beers and smiling at the camera, lights from the country music festival twinkling in the background.\u201cDay Three Route 91 Vegas!\u201d he wrote in the caption.Hours later, Mr. Beaton, of Bakersfield, Calif., was killed while shielding his wife, Laurie, from gunfire, his family said.His father-in-law, Jerry Cook, told BakersfieldNow.com that Mr. Beaton had covered his wife\u2019s body with his own, and was shot. \u201cHe told her he loved her,\u201d he said. \u201cLaurie could tell he was slipping. She told him she loved him and she would see him in heaven.\u201dMr. Beaton, 54, was gregarious and always helping other people; a family man who adored driving his truck with his hat on sideways, Mr. Cook said.Mr. Beaton\u2019s son, Jake, paid tribute to his father on Facebook. \u201cLost my best friend,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI love you so much more than you could ever imagine. Please watch over our family. You will forever be remembered as our hero!\u201dWhatever Steve Berger did, he always seemed to be at the top of his game.\u201cI said, \u2018Steve, be careful,\u2019\u201d his father recalled.On Sunday night, Candice Bowers, 40, was taking a rare weekend away from her home and responsibilities in Orange County, Calif., listening to music with a friend at the Jason Aldean concert.\u201cCandice left this world doing what she loved, dancing to country music among loved ones,\u201d a GoFundMe page begun for her children said. \u201cShe will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.\u201dWhenever Tony Burditus was away from Denise Salmon Burditus, his wife of 32 years, she sent him selfies, nearly always featuring one of her big, broad smiles.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t get it, I would text her back and she would send me one back with a smile.\u201dAs the shooting began, Mr. Burditus said the couple mistook the sound as pyrotechnics. \u201cWe stood there for a second and she asked me if it was gunfire and I told her, \u2018No.\u2019 And then it was during the second burst that we knew,\u201d Mr. Burditus said. They tried to get away.\u201cI was leading her through the crowd,\u201d he said. But she was shot, and Mr. Burditus said he \u201cimmediately knew her wound was fatal. She was unconscious from the time she was struck.\u201d Ms. Burditus was 50.Over the course of a carefree weekend in Las Vegas, they kept bumping into one another around the festival: at least a half dozen teachers, principals and school psychologists who worked for the Manhattan Beach School District in Southern California, taking a brief escape from their responsibilities to listen to live music.The school district said on Monday that Sandy Casey, 34, a special-education teacher originally from Vermont, was killed in the shooting. The other staff members from the district were physically unharmed.Ms. Casey taught middle school and had worked for the district for nine years, an energetic person who delighted in her students, the superintendent, Mike Matthews, said.\u201cShe was a person who brings light wherever she is,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a classroom full of light and hope and caring.\u201dMs. Casey\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Chris Willemse, an instructional assistant for the district, was with Ms. Casey in Las Vegas. He wrote on Facebook: \u201cAs I sit and mourn such a beautiful life gone too fast, all I can say is look up and watch the birds fly high and free today, as that\u2019s where I feel you smiling down upon all of us. I love you baby girl! Love you to pieces!\u201dIt seemed like the Route 91 Harvest Festival would be the perfect place for Andrea Castilla, a sales associate at Sephora in Huntington Beach, Calif., to celebrate her 28th birthday. Her sister, Athena, would be there with her fianc\u00e9, and Andrea and her boyfriend, Derek Miller, decided to join them.He never had the chance. Ms. Castilla was killed in the attack, according to a text message from her aunt, Marina Castilla Parker, who posted photos to Facebook of Ms. Castilla beaming at the festival with her sister and their partners.In an interview with People, Athena Castilla said she and her fianc\u00e9 tried to keep Ms. Castilla from being stepped on after she fell. Athena said that strangers had helped put Andrea into the back of a truck for the drive to the hospital.\u201cI was holding onto her head and trying to keep her from losing so much blood, talking to her, kissing her, telling her she was going to make it,\u201d Athena Castilla said. \u201cWe all did our best to help her get through it. We did the best we could.\u201dDenise Cohen was never bored, or boring. Ms. Cohen, 58, was the \u201clife of the party,\u201d her younger sister, Kristal Vogel, said: \u201cthe first one to be out and the last one to go to bed.\u201dShe loved to be outdoors, whether on a beach or at a festival like Route 91, which she attended with her boyfriend, Derrick Taylor, who also died. She was particularly excited to see Jason Aldean, whom Ms. Vogel had seen live a few days before. \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t wait to see Jason Aldean\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s all I heard all weekend,\u201d Ms. Vogel said.Ms. Cohen had two sons, both in their 30s, and lived in Carpinteria, Calif., near Santa Barbara. She had recently started working for Team HOA, a division of McFarland Financial that focused on homeowner association accounting.Austin Davis, 29, a pipe fitter from Riverside, Calif., made the trip to Las Vegas with Thomas Day Jr., a softball buddy who also died.The two played \u201cfast-pitch softball\u201d together, Berta Garcia, the coed director for USA Softball of Southern California, told The Riverside Press-Enterprise. \u201cTom kind of guided him.\u201dAfter the shooting, Mr. Davis\u2019 girlfriend, Aubree Hennigan, had posted urgent pleas for help on social media as she and his parents sought news of his whereabouts. Before receiving confirmation of his death, she wrote on Facebook: \u201cMy everything \u2026 Please come home to us.\u201dA \u201cHomerun Derby\u201d was being planned, in honor of Mr. Davis and Mr. Day. \u201cI will be there for my man and I would love to see everyone,\u201d Ms. Hennigan wrote.Thomas Day Jr., 54, was a contractor who worked in a branch of his father\u2019s home-building business in Corona, Calif. He had traveled to Las Vegas to attend the concert with three of his grown children and a group of friends.His father, Thomas Day Sr., said he received a call from his grandson late on Sunday: The three adult children and the friends were in hiding, the grandson said, but Mr. Day had been shot in the head.The elder Mr. Day, who lives in Las Vegas, said his son, who was divorced, was a \u201cgreat dad\u201d who often attended concerts with his children.He had not been able to see the body or bury his son. \u201cThey still have him,\u201d he said.Christiana Duarte, 22, had a gorgeous singing voice. And she was much like her parents, a family friend, Danette Meyers, said. \u201cShe was very giving,\u201d Ms. Meyers said.Ms. Duarte had gone to the country music festival with her brother\u2019s girlfriend, Ariel Romero. Both women were shot, Ms. Meyers said. Ms. Romero had been through surgery and was expected to recover, Ms. Meyers said.Ms. Duarte\u2019s father, Michael, is a longtime employee of the Los Angeles prosecutor\u2019s office, where he has regularly consoled the victims of crimes and their families, she said. Now his own family was wrestling with loss.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how this has hit all of us,\u201d Ms. Meyers said. \u201cThis is just unbelievable. This senseless, violent act is just killing us all.\u201dAfter the first round of shots, Stacee Etcheber\u2019s husband, Vincent, told her to run, he told family members. An off-duty officer with the San Francisco Police Department, he stayed behind to try to help.Then the second round came.Mr. Etcheber\u2019s father, Jean, who was babysitting the couple\u2019s two children, 10 and 12, at their Novato, Calif., home, said the family was given confirmation of Ms. Etcheber\u2019s death on Monday night.Ms. Etcheber, 50, was a hairdresser whose Facebook profile picture shows her working on her beach handstand next to her daughter.\u201cPlease pray for our family during this difficult time,\u201d Ms. Etcheber\u2019s brother-in-law, Al Etcheber, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday morning.Brian Fraser, 39, was in his element at the Jason Aldean concert on Sunday night, his family said. He had just moved closer to the stage in the hopes that his favorite song, \u201cDirt Road Anthem,\u201d was coming soon.Moments later, he was fatally shot. His companions \u2014 his wife, Stephanie, and other family members and friends \u2014 survived.\u201cA bigger-than-life man taken far too soon,\u201d his sisters-in-law wrote on a GoFundMe page. \u201cBrian was a rock of love and support to his family.\u201dA vice president of sales for Greenpath, a mortgage firm, Mr. Fraser lived in La Palma, Calif., and graduated from California Polytechnic State University.\u201cBrian Fraser impacted everyone who crossed his path with his infectious positive energy, his tenacious will to succeed, and his willingness to help others,\u201d his employer said in a statement.Keri Galvan, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., had three children, and they were her world. On her Instagram page, she called herself a \u201csuper tired super mama of 3.\u201d On Facebook, she posted a photograph of herself standing next to a new Lexus S.U.V., and wrote: \u201cNew baby to accommodate allllllllll the babies.\u201d\u201cThey always went to Disneyland together,\u201d Isaac Galvan, her father-in-law, said. \u201cShe was just a great mother.\u201dMs. Galvan, 31, who had worked for a decade as a server at Mastro\u2019s Steakhouse in Thousand Oaks, attended the music festival in Las Vegas with her husband, Justin Galvan, and some of their friends.\u201cHer days started and ended with doing everything in her power to be a wonderful mother,\u201d Ms. Poole said.Dana Gardner, the deputy recorder of San Bernardino County, Calif., began working for the county 26 years ago as a document clerk, a county spokesman, David Wert, said in an email. Ms. Gardner, 52, was \u201cknown for her \u2018can-do\u2019 attitude and vibrant energy,\u201d Bob Dutton, the county\u2019s assessor, recorder and clerk, wrote on Facebook.In a Facebook message, Kayla Gardner, Dana Gardner\u2019s daughter, said: \u201cShe spent our whole childhood making sacrifices and doing anything and everything she could for us.\u201dShe added later, \u201cAs we got older and became adults, for the first time in her life she stopped worrying about taking care of us and started to take care of herself. She started traveling, spending time with her friends, and enjoying her life the way she wanted. As her children, it was so enjoyable to see her so vibrant and full of life, and that is how we will always remember her.\u201dMs. Gomez, a nursing student from Riverside, Calif. who was known as Angie, was in Las Vegas with her boyfriend when the shooting began.Rocio Guillen and her fianc\u00e9, Christopher Jaksha, left their two children with Mr. Jaksha\u2019s parents for some rare time alone: a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend\u2019s birthday.Each night they were away, they made video calls to say good night, blowing kisses at Sophia, 17 months, and Austin, who was born in August, said Mr. Jaksha\u2019s mother, Donna.\u201cWe Facetimed all weekend,\u201d Ms. Jaksha said. \u201cWe would say \u2018Look, it\u2019s mommy and daddy. Look at the cowboy hats.\u2019\u201dMs. Guillen, 40, was shot in the thigh as she ran from the shooting with Mr. Jaksha. She was placed in a police car, and an officer applied a tourniquet, but she did not survive.The couple met when they worked at a Chili\u2019s restaurant as managers. They shared a home in Eastvale, Calif., and both worked at California Pizza Kitchen restaurants nearby as they planned for their wedding. Ms. Guillen has two sons from a previous marriage, according to Ms. Jaksha. \u201cI already considered her to be my daughter-in-law,\u201d Ms. Jaksha said.\u201cEvery time you talked to him, your life would be better,\u201d Stan King, a friend whose son played football on a team, the Henderson Cowboys, that Officer Hartfield had coached. \u201cYou wished you were 10 percent of what that guy was.\u201dOfficer Hartfield, who had served on the police force for 11 years, was memorialized in a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds.Fellow officers and friends remembered the man they called Charlie or Coach Chucky, or even, occasionally, \u201cCaptain America\u201d as knowledgeable and experienced, a patriot and a wit.\u201cI know that none of us here really planned on saying goodbye to Charlie so soon, but I\u2019m glad we get to send him off in our way, not somebody else\u2019s way,\u201d said Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association.Chris Hazencomb, 44, of Camarillo, Calif., had a modest birthday celebration with his mother, Maryanne Hazencomb, 69, last Wednesday. They ran errands, picked up fried chicken, and, as they did every Wednesday, watched an episode of \u201cThe Little Couple\u201d that Mr. Hazencomb had recorded the previous day.The mother and son had always lived together, and worked in tandem to care for Mr. Hazencomb\u2019s father, who was ill for a decade before he died. Mr. Hazencomb had something to look forward to, as well: The Route 91 Harvest music festival, which he was attending with his best friend\u2019s wife. (The best friend, it turned out, hated country music.)Ms. Hazencomb got the news Sunday night. Mr. Hazencomb had been shot in the head. Ms. Hazencomb rushed to Sunrise Hospital, in Las Vegas, leaving Camarillo at 3 a.m. Mr. Hazencomb was on a ventilator, Ms. Hazencomb said, and officials told her he would not survive.\u201cHe looked like he was sleeping,\u201d Ms. Hazencomb said. Members of her extended family gathered in the hospital room. After getting last rites from the Catholic Church, he was taken off life support.Ms. Hazencomb said her son had died shielding his best friend\u2019s wife from bullets. \u201cHe\u2019d give you the shirt off his back,\u201d Ms. Hazencomb said.Jennifer Irvine, 42, built her own legal practice in San Diego, specializing in family law. But there was also time for hobbies like snowboarding and Taekwondo \u2014 and for her friends and country music.\u201cShe did go to a lot of concerts,\u201d Jason Irvine, Jennifer\u2019s brother, said, as he waited at the Las Vegas Convention Center to pick up her belongings.Ms. Irvine had attended the festival in Las Vegas with a group of girlfriends, some of whom had posted pictures of their group, wearing jean shorts and cowboy boots, grinning in front of the festival banner.\u201cShe was there with three other friends who were able to leave when it started, but unfortunately Jennifer was not one of those who was able to leave,\u201d Mr. Irvine said.Nicol Kimura, 38, of Placentia, Calif., was part of a close-knit group of 16 friends who always spent time together, said Ryan Miller, one of the people in the group. To the children of those friends, Ms. Kimura was simply Auntie Nicol, he said \u2014 a playmate who was eager to host tea parties, color with them and craft.\u201cJust a beaming light,\u201d Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview.Seven of the friends went to the concert in Las Vegas; they had already been to several other concerts this year, but they were especially excited to attend the weekend\u2019s Route 91 Harvest Festival, Mr. Miller said.The group of friends was together when shots first rang out, Mr. Miller said. Soon, everyone had hit the ground.As the gunfire continued, another friend, about 20 feet away, yelled out that Ms. Kimura had been hurt; she was bleeding from her side.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t pull her to safety,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Late Sunday afternoon, Carly Kreibaum\u2019s Facebook page showed the smiling proof of a girls\u2019 weekend in full swing: a picture of Ms. Kreibaum with two friends at the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 a cafe, canal and gondolas in the background.At the concert that evening, Ms. Kreibaum, 33, a mother of two from Sutherland, Iowa, was fatally shot, a family member said. Her friends survived.Back in northwest Iowa, her small community of 600 has been in mourning for Ms. Kreibaum, who studied art education at Wayne State College in Nebraska and worked at Walmart.On Facebook on Tuesday, Mr. Kreibaum thanked family and friends for their support, saying he was en route to Las Vegas. A local church set up a fund for donations for the Kreibaum family, and on Wednesday evening, it opened up the church, inviting those who wanted to talk, pray or deal with their grief.When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Rhonda LeRocque flew down with other members of her church to help the victims.\u201cFor more than 10 years she cared for her work family at IDEO Cambridge with the same warmth, love and devotion she showed everyone in her life,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cNobody helped us build community quite like Rhonda.\u201dWhen Victor Link, of Orange County, Calif., was struck by gunfire, he had his own rescue crew right beside him.\u201cRob, his best friend, who is a firefighter and a paramedic, picked my son up and carried him to a safer place and tried to resuscitate him,\u201d Mr. Link\u2019s father, Loyd, said on Tuesday. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen.\u201dMr. Link, 55, worked in the financial services industry and lived with his partner, Lynne Gonzales. He had a son, Christian, from a previous marriage, his father said.\u201cMy son took a bullet to the chest,\u201d he said.\u201cWe only had one child,\u201d they told CBC News. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dThere were two Ms. Meadows who were well known in the halls of Taft Union High School in Taft, Calif.: Stacy, who has worked at the school for 35 years, and Kelsey, her daughter, a substitute teacher.Kelsey Meadows, who was 28, was killed in the shooting, leaving behind her parents, brother and sister-in-law, \u201calong with an entire community that loved and respected her,\u201d the school said in a statement.The younger Ms. Meadows graduated from Taft Union High School in 2007 and returned in 2012 to work there as a teacher \u2014 alongside her mother, who worked in information technology. \u201cKelsey was smart, compassionate and kind,\u201d Mary Alice Finn, the principal, said in an email. \u201cShe had a sweet spirit and a love for children.\u201dBrad Meadows, her brother, informed friends of her death on Facebook \u201cwith an absolutely shattered heart,\u201d he wrote.Calla Medig could not stop chattering to her co-workers at Moxie\u2019s Grill and Bar, a restaurant in Edmonton, Alberta, where she was a bartender and server, about her upcoming trip to Las Vegas.\u201cI even gave her a hard time because I don\u2019t like country music,\u201d said her boss, Scott Collingwood. \u201cI told her, \u2018You\u2019re going to be out there two-stepping. And she said, \u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with two-stepping!\u2019\u201dMs. Medig, 28, was a warm and funny presence in the restaurant, where she had worked for two years.She was so dependable and levelheaded that when Mr. Collingwood couldn\u2019t reach her by phone, text or Facebook in the aftermath of the shooting on Sunday night, he immediately feared the worst.\u201cCalla is super responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cI just knew.\u201dMs. Medig was scheduled to fly back home on Wednesday. Thursday was important to her. It was to have been her first day at the restaurant after being promoted to manager.When Sonny Melton and his wife, Heather Gulish Melton, heard the sound of gunshots in Las Vegas on Sunday night, he grabbed her and began to run.\u201cI felt him get shot in the back,\u201d Ms. Gulish Melton told WCYB, a television station in northeast Tennessee. \u201cI want everyone to know what a kindhearted, loving man he was, but at this point, I can barely breathe.\u201dMr. Melton, 29, was described in Facebook tributes as a kind spirit, a registered nurse who worked for much of 2016 in the surgical unit at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital in Jackson, Tenn.\u201cHe was a very kind, compassionate, genuine person who lived life to the fullest, and he took great care of our patients,\u201d said Amy Garner, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Union University, a college in Jackson, Tenn., said Mr. Melton was a 2015 graduate of the school and worked in the emergency department at Henry County Medical Center.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Melton and his wife had been married only a year and had traveled from Tennessee for the music festival.\u201cWhen the bullets began raining down from above, Sonny shielded her from danger, selflessly giving up his life to save hers,\u201d Ms. Sanders said on Monday.Not long before the shooting began, Pati Mestas posted a video on Facebook. It showed her jumping up and down in front of the stage at the Route 91 festival, having made her way up to the front of the crowd.\u201cThat was the type of person she was,\u201d her cousin Tom Smith said. \u201cIf you could do it and if it wasn\u2019t wrong, she would do it.\u201dMs. Mestas, 67, was partly retired from her job as a deli manager at a Shell convenience store in Corona, Calif., and was spending all the time she could with her three children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild, Mr. Smith said. He saw her in March, he recalled, and she had never seemed so happy.\u201cWhen she did something, she did it 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cShe was faithful to her family, to her friends, a very strong Christian, and she couldn\u2019t get enough out of life.\u201dAustin Meyer, 24, hoped to own an auto repair shop, his sister, Veronica Meyer, told KSBW, a television news station in Monterey, Calif.Mr. Meyer had recently moved from his home near Monterey to Reno, Nev. to earn a degree in transportation technologies at Truckee Meadows Community College.\u201cHe was a wonderful young man and my future son-in-law,\u201d Ms. Getreu\u2019s father, Gary Getreu, said in a statement released by the college. \u201cThe loss and grief his family and mine feel at this time is beyond belief.\u201dAdrian Murfitt, 35, had been working 16-hour days all summer as a commercial salmon fisherman in his home state of Alaska. It was time for a break.He gathered up two of his childhood friends and booked tickets for a country music festival, just as he had done last year, according to his sister, Shannon Gothard.\u201cHe had such a great time when he went before, and he wanted to treat himself for a successful fishing season,\u201d Ms. Gothard said from Anchorage.Mr. Murfitt was an Alaskan to the core. Since he was a toddler, he loved playing hockey, she said; he could fix almost anything mechanical; he was devoted to his dog, Paxson, a Western Siberian Laika.Ms. Gothard said the family had pieced together her brother\u2019s last minutes from Brian MacKinnon, a friend who was with him at the concert on Sunday night. \u201cHe was just having a good time, enjoying himself and got shot in the neck,\u201d she said of her brother. A woman standing next to Mr. Murfitt was shot in the head, Mr. MacKinnon told the family. He watched as medics tried to resuscitate Mr. Murfitt, though the medics told Mr. MacKinnon to leave the scene for his own safety.\u201cSadly, he died in my arms,\u201d Mr. MacKinnon wrote on Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what else to say at this time. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dShe was 33 and had worked at the department for 10 years.As children growing up in California, they were always together, so close that their names seemed to run together into one: Jenny-and-Bobby.\u201cShe said, \u2018I am going to marry Bobby,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Parks\u2019s aunt, Rhonda Boyle. \u201cI guess she always had a little crush on him.\u201dThey became high school sweethearts and later married. And they were together on Sunday night in Las Vegas, when Ms. Parks, 36, was fatally shot while attending the concert with her husband, Bobby Parks. Mr. Parks was wounded in the arm and a finger, her family said.The Westside Union School District, where she worked, said Ms. Parks \u201cwill be remembered for her sense of humor, her passion for her work, her devotion to her students, and her commitment to continuing her own learning and to taking on whatever new projects came her way.\u201dMs. Parks was a mother of two, a kindergarten teacher and a volleyball coach in Lancaster, Calif.\u201cShe had a heart of gold,\u201d Ms. Boyle said.Ms. Parsons had posted photographs on social media and wrote \u201cNight made,\u201d after the performance of Eric Church, her favorite country music artist, KOMO reported.Lisa Patterson was determined that her three children, now 19, 17 and 8, would grow up to be fearless.She pushed them to take part in school plays so that they would be confident taking risks. She drove them to softball practice so that they would learn teamwork. She made sure they performed community service, while juggling her own volunteer work and helping to run her husband\u2019s small hardwood flooring business, without the aid of a housekeeper or nanny.The trip to Las Vegas, with a group of mom friends from her church, was a departure for Ms. Patterson, 46, of Lomita, Calif., who was typically too occupied to take time out for herself. But her love of all types of music was well known to her friends and family, who would often be induced to sing with her in the car, loud enough to provoke looks from others sitting in traffic nearby.The children, said her close friend, Deborah Beckman, learned to simply smile back.\u201cShe has brought them up to really stand on their two feet,\u201d Ms. Beckman said. \u201cAnd I thank God because I think that will help them to be able to deal with it.\u201dWhen the gunfire began on Sunday night, John Phippen, and his son, Travis, followed the same urgent instinct: to try to save people.Then John Phippen was shot.\u201cI got over there as fast as I could and I put my arm around him,\u201d Travis Phippen said.With the help of a bystander, they got John Phippen away from the area, but he did not survive.\u201cHe told me that he loved me and he wanted everybody to know how much he loved them,\u201d the younger Mr. Phippen said.Melissa Ramirez, 26, grew up in California\u2019s Antelope Valley amid a big and close-knit extended family that she often visited on weekends when she attended college, at California State University, Bakersfield.Her love of country music drew her to the festival in Las Vegas, her cousin, Fabiola Farnetti, said on Tuesday. When the two were in high school, they spent summers working alongside Ms. Ramirez\u2019s parents selling fruit and vegetables for a local farm company at flea markets in the area.The daughter of Mexican immigrants who became United States citizens, Ms. Ramirez majored in business and had recently received a promotion at the car insurance company where she worked, her cousin said.\u201cShe always helped her parents, and just wanted to be there,\u201d Ms. Farnetti said.The family had held out hope that she had survived the shooting, but her father identified her remains at the Las Vegas morgue early on Tuesday.On her Instagram account, she posted photographs of her dog, a boxer, her young niece and, most recently, from her trip to Las Vegas.Jordyn Rivera, 21, a health care management student at California State University, San Bernardino, spent part of last summer in London for the school\u2019s study abroad program.\u201cWe will remember and treasure her for her warmth, optimism, energy and kindness,\u201d the university\u2019s president, Tomas Morales, wrote in an email on Tuesday to employees and students.Ms. Rivera, of La Verne, Calif., had traveled to the concert with her mother, a friend told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.She would have graduated next year.An aunt of Quinton Robbins, 20, who worked as a recreation assistant for the city of Henderson, Nev., wrote on Facebook that her nephew was among the dead.\u201cI can\u2019t say enough good about this sweet soul,\u201d the aunt, Kilee Wells Sanders, wrote of Mr. Robbins. \u201cEveryone who met him loved him. His contagious laugh and smile.\u201dOutside of his job with the city of Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, Mr. Robbins coached flag football for 5-year-olds, his brother\u2019s flag football team and softball teams. He also coached basketball along with his uncle at a high school, and was finishing certification to be a full-time coach for the Clark County School District.Mr. Robbins had been thrilled to score tickets to the music festival. \u201cHe was a big country music fan and he and his girlfriend were excited to go,\u201d said James DiNicola, Mr. Robbins\u2019s friend and colleague at the Henderson recreational department. \u201cIt was a last-minute thing.\u201dCameron Robinson, 28, had taken Monday off from his job as a management analyst for the city of Las Vegas to attend the country music festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley.The creator of a smartphone app that eased navigation for attendees of the city government\u2019s annual conferences, Mr. Robinson was a frequent volunteer at city events, and had been given a promotion last summer, according to Brad Jerbic, the city attorney for Las Vegas and a family friend.\u201cHe was driven, but not so driven that he didn\u2019t know how to enjoy life,\u201d Mr. Jerbic said.Mr. Robinson was shot in the neck, Mr. Jerbic said. He died shortly after 10 p.m. Sunday night, in Mr. Eardley\u2019s arms.Tara Roe Smith, 34, of Alberta, an educational assistant, was separated from her husband during the attack, according to The Edmonton Journal.\u201cTara was an aide in my granddaughter\u2019s preschool class,\u201d wrote Viola Anderson, a resident of Okotoks, where Ms. Roe Smith lived, on a GoFundMe page set up by a friend. \u201cShe will be missed.\u201dThe mother of two young sons, she grew up in Manitoba, where the community is \u201cheartbroken,\u201d a family friend told CTV Manitoba.\u201cIt is with sadness, shock, and grief that we confirm the loss of a Foothills School Division staff member,\u201d John Bailey, superintendent of the school district where Ms. Roe Smith worked, wrote in a statement posted on the district\u2019s website. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected by this unimaginable attack.\u201dLast year, Lisa Romero-Muniz\u2019s husband, Chris, forgot their wedding anniversary. This year he was determined to make it up to her.So he made a grand gesture, planning a four-day weekend in Las Vegas and buying tickets to see her favorite country singer, Jason Aldean. Mr. Muniz, who worked long hours at a refinery, and Ms. Romero-Muniz, 48 and a high school secretary in Gallup, N.M., left on Thursday for Las Vegas, more than a six-hour drive away.\u201cShe was beyond excited,\u201d said Rosie Fernandez, her friend and supervisor at the high school where they worked. \u201cFor her husband to remember her anniversary and do all of that, this was a big thing for her.\u201dMs. Romero-Muniz\u2019s death, confirmed by officials at the school where she worked, left her colleagues and community shaken, her co-workers said.Born and raised in the small city of Gallup, she was a mother of three grown children and a secretary at Miyamura High School, where she was responsible for disciplining students who got into trouble. Ms. Romero-Muniz had a warm personality and a big laugh, always teasing her co-workers, Ms. Fernandez said.\u201cWe were known as the two loudmouths of the office,\u201d Ms. Fernandez said. \u201cShe knew 90 percent of the kids at this school. She would talk to them like she was talking to her own children. I\u2019d hear her saying, \u2018I know you can do better than this.\u2019\u201dOn Monday morning, administrators put up posters around the school so that students could write on them how they were feeling. A candlelight memorial is planned for Monday evening.Christopher Roybal went to the concert with his mother, Debby Allen, to celebrate his 29th birthday.\u201cI just kept saying, \u2018My son, my son, where is my son?\u2019\u201d Ms. Allen said. \u201cThis guy wouldn\u2019t let me go back in. He goes: \u2018You have to run away from the gunfire, not towards the gunfire.\u2019\u201dHe was a Navy veteran who had served stints in Afghanistan. In a Facebook post in July, he had recalled the emotions of battle: \u201cThe anger stays, long after your friends have died, the lives you\u2019ve taken are buried and your boots are placed neatly in a box in some storage unit.\u201dGrowing up in Arizona with five siblings, Brett Schwanbeck, 61, was a brother who loved to joke around and have fun. He had the most beautiful smile ever, his sister, Robin Martin, said. \u201cHe was very, very full of life,\u201d she said.Mr. Schwanbeck, a retired truck driver who lived in Bullhead City, Ariz., had met Ms. Orozco in high school in Ash Fork. Their romance blossomed much later.Ms. Martin said she tried to speak to her brother after the shooting while he was on life support in the hospital, hoping that he could hear her.\u201cFamily meant everything to him,\u201d she said.At Infinity Communications and Consulting, the Bakersfield, Calif., company where Bailey Schweitzer worked as a receptionist, Ms. Schweitzer \u201cwas always the ray of sunshine in our office on a cloudy day,\u201d Fred Brakeman, the company\u2019s president, said. \u201cNo one could possibly have a bad day when Bailey was around. If you have ever called or visited our office, she was the perky one that helped direct you to the staff member you needed.\u201dThe staff at the Chili\u2019s restaurant in Arroyo Market Square in Las Vegas knew it was Friday when Laura Shipp, 50, took her seat by the bar and ordered her favorites: Smoked wings and a Presidente Margarita.\u201cLike clockwork she would be there Friday night, first seat at the bar,\u201d said Chris Atkinson, a manager at the restaurant, over a Facebook message.The wings were not the only draw. Ms. Shipp\u2019s son, Corey, 23, a marine reservist, was a bartender and server there, and she liked to be around him. She was so well-liked, Mr. Atkinson said, that he and Corey\u2019s other friends took to calling her \u201cMama Shipp.\u201d And Corey Shipp liked having her around.\u201cThese two seemed like, even if they weren\u2019t family, they would still be best friends,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said.Corey Shipp moved to Las Vegas first, and Laura Shipp followed. \u201cCorey was her only and Laura was his only,\u201d said Steve Shipp, 47, Ms. Shipp\u2019s brother, who confirmed her death.They loved the Dodgers and country music, which is what brought them to the festival. Corey Shipp was not harmed, but he could not find his mother despite a frantic search that involved many members of the Chili\u2019s staff.\u201cIt took about 28, to 30 hours, just even to figure out that she had passed,\u201d Mr. Shipp, the brother, said.The security staff working at the Route 91 festival were the first to help, and Erick Silva, 21, of Las Vegas was one of them. Mr. Silva, who was assigned to a position near the front of the stage, began trying to help audience members escape over a barricade.As he worked to usher others away, he was shot, and was later pronounced dead in the hospital, Jay Purves, the Nevada vice president of Mr. Silva\u2019s employer, Contemporary Services Corp., said in an email.Two other C.S.C. employees were also shot, but they survived, Mr. Purves said. \u201cWatching the many video clips on YouTube and social media, you see our men and women in the yellow shirts jumping right into the middle of the chaos as it started to help those who were shot.\u201d\u201cHe never complained about anything.\u201dThe company will name one of its training centers after Mr. Silva, Mr. Purves said.Susan Smith, 53, was a lover of country music, a devoted mother to a son and daughter, a wife and a popular office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley, Calif.\u201cA wonderful person,\u201d said her father, Tom Rementer, through tears.She had gone to Las Vegas with friends. They survived the shooting.A year ago, Brennan Stewart posted on Facebook a video of himself performing the country song \u201cYou Should Be Here.\u201d It has gone viral in recent days. Grieving families and friends \u2014 and not just his \u2014 have seen it as a touchstone after the Route 91 shooting.In his original post on Oct. 4, 2016, Mr. Stewart wrote that he had taken a \u201cslower approach\u201d to the song, written by the musician Cole Swindell in 2015 after the death of his father. \u201cThoughts on this one!?\u201d Mr. Stewart asked.\u201cSolid performance. Rest in peace, Brennan,\u201d read one of dozens of recent replie+s on the old thread.A tribute to the love of country music that propelled Mr. Stewart, 30, of Las Vegas, and so many others to the music festival, the video has been shared over a thousand times.\u201cYou should be here.\u201dA California corrections officer in charge of inmates who volunteer to fight forest fires, Derrick Taylor, 56, of Oxnard, Calif., had been stationed in the northern tip of the state last month, where a fire had been burning for weeks.He made it home just in time to leave for the trip he had planned with his girlfriend, Denise Cohen, to attend the music festival in Las Vegas. The couple both died in the attack. In his job and in his personal relationships, Mr. Taylor, his younger son Kyle, 31, said, was kind, generous \u2014 and honest.When he was in college, the younger Mr. Taylor recalled, his father sometimes called to make sure he was in class. He also insisted that his grandchildren leave video games behind while he escorted them to the park or on hikes. Friends the younger Mr. Taylor had not heard from since high school contacted him after hearing about his father\u2019s death. They remembered him as a kind of \u201csecond dad.\u201d\u201cHe was someone who cares enough to hold you accountable,\u201d Mr. Taylor said, \u201cfor who you could be and who you should be.\u201dNeysa Tonks, 46 and a mother of three from Las Vegas, had brought \u201cso much joy, fun and laughter\u201d to her workplace, according to her employer, Technologent.Michelle Vo was one of those people who didn\u2019t waste time.In the last few months, she was a whirlwind of new hobbies \u2014 paddle boarding, golf, even surfing, said a close friend, Casey Lubin. She had already been all over Europe and Southeast Asia. Next on her list was Iceland \u2014 she was determined to travel there by herself.Ms. Vo and Ms. Lubin had met through a mutual friend. \u201cHe was like, \u2018You have to meet this girl, the two of you are meant to be friends,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lubin said. \u201cShe\u2019s like a shark. She\u2019s a go-getter. She\u2019s so inspiring.\u201dMs. Vo, 32 and an insurance agent from Los Angeles, was by herself at the concert on Sunday when she befriended a stranger, Kody Robertson, of Ohio. Ms. Vo was standing next to Mr. Robertson when she was shot.Mr. Von Tillow had traveled to Las Vegas for the concert with family members. His wife and daughter escaped unharmed, Mr. Carson said. Mr. Von Tillow\u2019s sister was shot in the thigh and his niece in an ankle. Both were expected to recover.Mr. Von Tillow\u2019s wife told family members she was herded out of the area by the authorities amid the chaos of the shooting scene, Mr. Carson said. \u201cThat was probably the hardest part for her \u2014 having to leave him there,\u201d he said.On Monday, friends and family gathered at the Cameron Park Country Club, where Mr. Von Tillow was a member. At his home, family members set up a memorial with an American flag, and played the national anthem.\u201cGuarantee you, he\u2019s covered in red, white and blue right now, with a Coors Light in his hand, smiling with his family and listening to some music,\u201d Mr. Carson told the television station.Bill Wolfe Jr., a wrestling and Little League coach in Shippensburg, Pa., went to Las Vegas with his wife, Robyn, to celebrate their wedding anniversary.

{"Headline": "\u2018You\u2019re a Quadriplegic\u2019: A Las Vegas Victim Faces a Hard Reality", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOMA LINDA, Calif. \u2014 \u201cThis is your life,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cYou\u2019re a quadriplegic.\u201dWhen she heard the news, Kim Gervais broke down. The tears rolled out, and her daughter clasped her mother\u2019s head, overcome by her own inability to help.Then came Ms. Gervais\u2019s trip home to Southern California. And here she was, three weeks after the shooting, strapped into a wheelchair at a rehabilitation clinic, toughing it out with a physical therapist and straining to drink from a sippy cup as her toddler grandchildren looked on.This is the road after Las Vegas, after a high-stakes gambler named Stephen Paddock hauled powerful weapons into a gilded casino and opened fire on a country music festival below. The journey \u2014 as the survivors of so many other American mass shootings will say \u2014 is one full of chronic pain, fights with insurance, ruined marriages, lost jobs, anguished parents and children, and the injustice of being forced into a new identity: victim.And this time, with 58 people dead, at least 161 pierced by bullets, and more than 20,000 concertgoers from around the country left to soak in the memories of that night, the web of trauma spans from coast to coast, linking the casualties of this attack with those of all the others. San Bernardino. Aurora. Orlando. Newtown. And on and on.Some people left Las Vegas with a few trample wounds and the vision of a night gone horribly wrong. Others face radically altered lives.Then came the crack of gunfire, and they were three panicked women trapped in a killing field.Pati died.A bullet hit Kim in the back.Only Dana emerged unharmed.So much of the attention in the aftermath of mass shootings has been focused on the gunman and the number left dead in his wake. But the injured who survive carry a special burden. \u201cWe all kind of forget that these people have to live with it for the rest of their lives,\u201d said Dr. Bryan Tsao, chair of the neurology department at Loma Linda University Health.Dr. Tsao is still treating three patients from the 2015 San Bernardino attack. Battered physically and emotionally, none have been able to return to work, he said.He described the post-shooting process as one of deconstructing old lives and reconstructing new ones.\u201cThose that I\u2019ve seen that cannot \u2014 that cannot stop dwelling on the tragedy of it, on the injustice of it, on their permanent disability \u2014 they don\u2019t do well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey take the struggle and kind of go down a different road.\u201dMs. Gervais is being treated at Loma Linda, not far from her house, and just four miles from the scene of the San Bernardino attack.On Day 19 of her recovery, she was in her hospital room, in the wheelchair, wearing a neck brace and thick compression socks. A humidifier puffed mist above her head. Her daughter Amber Manka, 30, stood by with her own two children.Ms. Gervais, 56, runs a business servicing trash compactors. She spends \u2014 or spent \u2014 her weekends riding ATVs in the desert, wearing leather gloves and a full-face helmet. When her husband, a sprint car racer, died after a crash, she raised her two girls on her own.She had lived a difficult life, she said, which steeled her for challenges. But even for her, this was a lot. \u201cI\u2019m disgusted,\u201d she said of the gunman. \u201cI\u2019m angered, I have all kinds of emotions toward him. Because he took a part of me that I can\u2019t get back.\u201dShe blames her injuries on Mr. Paddock, not the casino or the concert host or gunmakers. \u201cI have nothing against guns. Just him.\u201dShe has no feeling in her legs, and extremely limited use of her arms. Her daughters saw it as a victory when she was able to bend and extend her elbows, something doctors had not expected. She does about three hours of physical therapy a day.\u201cWhy would one person do something like this to people?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re that unhappy with your life, why hurt others?\u201dAt night, the workers here turn her every few hours, to prevent bedsores. And sometimes she wakes up shaking.Her daughter, Ms. Manka, has steered the family since the shooting, aided by her husband and younger sister.She already has anxiety, and when she learned that her mother had been shot, she spent an hour vomiting.In private, Ms. Manka said she was overwhelmed. \u201cBut mostly I just try to keep that away from her,\u201d she said.At the hospital, a man entered with a clipboard and said he was there to discuss the equipment Ms. Gervais will need when she goes home, which could be weeks or months from now. Among her needs are an expensive wheelchair, a remodeled bathroom, a new car, a nurse, and a way to run her business and pay her mortgage.\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, looking at the women, \u201cyour insurance will probably not cover any of this.\u201dMany families caught in mass attacks have found it difficult to pay for or get the care they need. Insurance companies put up fights. Donations run out.Ms. Gervais would have to figure out the money later. For now, Ms. Manka used her right arm to spoon butter noodles into her mother\u2019s mouth and her left to hold her daughter on her hip.\u201cCan I have some milk?\u201d Ms. Gervais said.Her daughter smiled and held the straw to her mother\u2019s lips.Two hundred people crowded into an elementary school cafeteria, where a large sign bore the school motto: \u201cNo Excuses at Sky Country.\u201d\u201cO-72!\u201d said the bingo announcer.At a lunch table in the back sat Dana Smith, the only one of the three women to make it out unscathed. She wore a blue shirt that matched her blue eyes.Ms. Smith, 52, had known both Kim and Pati for more than 20 years, and was the one who had brought them all together.In the weeks since the shooting, she had left the house three times, she said. She does not sleep or eat much, and spends time watching videos of that night, as if to remind herself it was real.Some days she gets out of bed. \u201cWednesday I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like I didn\u2019t care. There was nothing to get me going.\u201dShe has not returned to her job as an aide at a high school, because she is worried that the popping of milk cartons, a student prank, will throw her into a panic.\u201cI felt like it had been my fault,\u201d Ms. Strassner said. \u201cIf I had not run away from her, maybe she would not have been paralyzed, maybe her mother wouldn\u2019t have made the decision she made.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re never going to be the person you were the day before the shooting,\u201d she added. \u201cYou have to mourn the loss of that person.\u201dMs. Smith had visited Ms. Gervais a few days before the fund-raiser. That was difficult, she said, because she feels guilty for being able to walk, for being alive. And she feels guilty for feeling guilty, wishing she could bury her own anguish to help her friends.She is seeing a therapist, but is still haunted by the facts. \u201cThree of us went,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I left one in the morgue and one in the hospital.\u201dThe night of the concert, Pati Mestas, 67, had moved to the front row, where she danced while her friends hung back.This was typical for Ms. Mestas, who was one of the Go Girls, fans of a country radio station who wore wristbands so they could find each other at shows. She died wearing cowgirl boots and a star-spangled T-shirt.She had spent most of the past 15 years living with her son Jeremy Schmidt, his wife and their four children. She was the one who sneaked the little ones candy, who let them watch what they wanted on television.After the shooting, Mr. Schmidt raced to Las Vegas, unsure if his mother was alive. His youngest daughter, age 8, kept asking her mother: \u201cDid Dad find Nana?\u201dWhen Mr. Schmidt returned, he wrote in a Facebook post what he had told his daughter:What I won\u2019t do is harbor hate in my heart for the man who did this senseless act of violence.I will not allow my kids to let hate grow in their hearts for this man. He was so troubled that he thought ruining other people\u2019s lives was the answer.Well Mr. Stephen Paddock: I forgive you, sir.Ms. Mestas\u2019s three children, eight grandchildren, one great-grandchild, two brothers and many cousins set her funeral for Saturday, Oct. 28, at a memorial home guarded by a statue of Jesus leading his flock.Ms. Smith said she planned to attend.Ms. Gervais would not be able to leave the hospital.Susan C.

He never sold a house, though occasionally he\u2019d add a new one.This ever-growing stash didn\u2019t bother him and it wasn\u2019t the issue for which he sought my psychiatric help. When asked about this habit, he said, \u201cHoarding is for those without money. For those with money it\u2019s called collecting.\u201d Then, more seriously, he added, \u201cAren\u2019t we\u2019re talking about throwing out my life?\u201dIt was a question I hadn\u2019t thought much about, always tending to err on the side of discarding things with the vague thought that I\u2019d be preventing my children from having to do it. But I knew that my patient was not alone. When I told an old friend that over the years I\u2019d kept all her letters, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s great. I kept copies too.\u201dThis issue became more pressing one cold day this spring when my husband and his older brother had to move their 100-year-old mother into a studio apartment. Suddenly the largely theoretical problem had a new gritty reality. They were faced with sorting through the objects assembled during her long life: ivory figurines, poems for family occasions, a favorite hot-pink jacket, a baby grand piano their father had played jazz on, boxes of photos, wartime letters from an army outpost in the Aleutian Islands.Which items were too laden with meaning to let go? And what, exactly, was getting lost in this process?Curating her possessions, indeed her life itself, was hard enough, but within her apartment they discovered, like a Russian nesting doll, a trove of documents from their own lives. Unbeknown to them, their mother had collected every grammar-school essay, local newspaper clipping about their tennis tournaments and publication from their adult years. Suddenly their histories were on the block as well.Back at our apartment, two dingy, prewar-era closets were being redone, and to my horror a box of my childhood and adolescent diaries emerged. I could have sworn that I\u2019d thrown them out years ago. In fact I could remember doing it.In any event, there they were and we were awash in memorabilia. It was a life phase that no one had told us about: one in which a massive wave of objects, each representing a distinct shard of time, broke over us.It arrived carrying with it the weird, disquieting distortions that all too often accompany memory. Our brains focus easily on the present and on the deep past, but the stuff between is elastic, dilating and contracting unpredictably. Whole swaths of time simply don\u2019t compute for us. Whenever I\u2019m faced with a standard online form requiring my birthday, I stare in bafflement as I scroll down the long column of years.The reappearance of my diaries was disorienting. They didn\u2019t feel like a quaint remnant of the past. They felt deeply, unpleasantly familiar: the baby-blue, fake-leather cover with \u201cMy Diary\u201d stamped in gold letters with its little lock and key. My self-conscious 12-year-old entries seemed as if I\u2019d written them yesterday: \u201cI see myself with complete clarity reading this page \u2026 thinking how long ago that was when I was merely a schoolgirl not even in high school. I\u2019m already that person of the future.\u201dOh yeah? Well, here I am and I remember all too well being that annoying person writing in the diary.So why save these remnants? In the past, relatives faded graciously into oblivion. Becoming dead and then even deader, as they were no longer known by anyone living. Their descendants easily maintained the illusion that their ancestors had never been real, breathing people like themselves. The ancient couples were quaint in the stiff, sepia photos posing in their Sunday best or in jerky 16-millimeter home movies. Or there were no images at all and they simply got out of the way when their time was over. They ghosted themselves.To make matters even more complicated, our recent relatives, armed with endless videos, create their own highly edited narratives \u2014 virtual motion pictures \u2014 preserving what seems to them most engaging, flattering or fun. You won\u2019t find their pictures of them eating lunch at their desk, sleeping contorted in the confines of an overnight flight, waiting on a subway platform or watching TV reruns. It\u2019s all been a great holiday!Will new generations need storerooms for this ever-increasing load of familial documentation? Actually, we may be the last one to have our experiences annealed to physical objects. In the future, descendants as well as historians will be able to experience their subjects\u2019 lives virtually in real time through emails, texts, Facebook entries, Instagrams, videos. It\u2019s exhausting to contemplate. TMI.Yet for now, these lingering objects haunt us. Undoubtedly my patient was right. When we discard a person\u2019s accumulated possessions, we are throwing out the record of a life. The soft thump of the garbage bags on the landing tells of a small, soft death. Is it necessary? Yes. But it\u2019s an erasure that\u2019s irrevocable. Like the ash that surrounds bodies at Pompeii, these objects preserve the shape of a life \u2014 even after the living being is gone.Advertisement"}

Johnson died in an ambush in Niger, he told his sister in an hourlong video chat that he was ready to come home. He wanted to see his children again and return to his wife, then four months pregnant with their third child.\u201cHe was ready,\u201d said Torneisha Ghent, 24, who along with her brother grew up in Carol City, a neighborhood in north Miami-Dade County.But Sergeant Johnson remained committed to his role as an Army mechanic serving the 3rd Special Forces Group as part of a mission to train African troops in the fight against terrorism. He told friends and family he wanted to help his team. He also needed the money to buy a home for his growing family.Ms. Ghent would never see her brother again. Weeks after their last exchange, Sergeant Johnson\u2019s family learned that he had disappeared in a firefight. Days later, they learned of his death after an ambush. And then came the controversy over President Trump\u2019s call to Sergeant Johnson\u2019s widow, Myeshia Johnson, and the swirling feud that followed involving the president, his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, Ms. Johnson and Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, over what was said in the call. Yet many who knew the slain soldier now lament that Sergeant Johnson\u2019s story has gotten lost amid the flurry of criticism and accusations.The bitter back and forth is a marked contrast to his life, which family, friends and fellow soldiers say was characterized by kindness and an optimism that allowed him to rise above a tough upbringing, when so much around him seemed set on keeping him down.He went on to work as a produce stocker at Walmart \u2014 a job he kept during high school and until he joined the Army. Those who served with Sergeant Johnson said he wanted to provide the best life possible for his family and managed to turn his early knack for fixing things into a successful military career. Within three years he was a sergeant.\u201cHe would always mess with the screwdrivers and the pliers. The cars and trucks that my grandmother used to buy him, he would take them apart and put them back together,\u201d Ms. Ghent recalled. While in the Army, Sergeant Johnson taught himself how to cut hair, using his handiness and instructions from YouTube videos to become an unofficial barber for his Special Forces battalion, doing fades for $5 a pop.\u201cHe would cut all the Africans\u2019 hair. He had a little set up in his tent. He bought a bicycle and he took the wheel off of it and was riding in Africa with one tire,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Dennis Bohler, who supervised Sergeant Johnson during training at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, and became a close friend. The two men bonded over the fact they were both from Miami, and Sergeant Johnson often messaged Sergeant Bohler during his second tour in Niger.\u201cWe had the same culture growing up and knew the struggles that came about by just trying to get out of there,\u201d Sergeant Bohler said.Sergeant Johnson lived with an aunt and then an uncle after his mother\u2019s death and joined a mentoring program for young neighborhood boys, called the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. Ms. Wilson, the founder of the program, remained close to the Johnson family and had accompanied his widow to greet his body when Mr. Trump called.\u201cHe always loved to have fun, laugh and joke around, and help others,\u201d said Isaac Hodgeson, who was also in the mentoring program, and on the wrestling team with Sergeant Johnson.Posts from his life in Carol City also show he was stopped by the police repeatedly for little reason, but he never seemed to let it get him down. \u201cThink Big. Think Positive. Think Smart. Think Beautiful,\u201d he posted in 2012. That year he first tried to join the Army, but failed the language section aptitude test by a few points, according to a post. He studied and eventually passed.Soon after he met Sergeant Bohler and both men and their wives became friends. Sergeant Bohler, who now lives in Fort Lee in Virginia, remembers driving around for hours in 2014 as Sergeant Johnson looked for a home before he finally decided to live on base. Their families often ate Sunday dinners together, with both Sergeant Johnson and his wife cooking Thanksgiving-style meals of ham, macaroni and cheese, and pies.The couples celebrated when both wives found out they were pregnant with girls and due a few days apart. Sergeant Johnson and his wife, due in January, quickly began planning for the new baby and for life with their other two children, a young girl and boy.\u201cWhen he found out they were having a girl, he was very excited. He had already named the baby,\u201d Angiline Bohler said, adding that Sergeant Johnson didn\u2019t see the mission in Niger as dangerous because his first deployment went smoothly.Staff Sgt. Charles Taylor Jr., who also supervised Sergeant Johnson and escorted his body home from Niger, called him an \u201coutstanding soldier.\u201d The two last talked the day Sergeant Johnson and the team of Green Berets headed out on their fateful patrol.\u201cI told him \u2018I know you can make it\u2019 and to train up,\u201d Sergeant Taylor said. It was the last thing the two would ever talk about. Sergeant Johnson and three other soldiers would soon be dead.Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Or were we shirking our civic duty?For a nation settled by convicts, Australians can be sticklers for the rules. I think of this every time I see people waiting for the \u201cwalk\u201d sign at crosswalks where cars are nowhere to be seen, or when I interact with officials in Canberra or civil servants in New South Wales, who tend to insist that the way they do things is the only way they could ever be done, ever, anywhere.But here\u2019s the challenge that rule-following Australia now finds itself confronting: What\u2019s to be done with those who have a different experience, say in countries where rules are more negotiable, or those who simply want a less rigid society and more, well, encouragement of difference?Our ethical conundrum was relatively minor (kangaroos have survived far worse than white bread), but there are bigger issues afoot that are testing Australia\u2019s sense of when to hold the line and when to live and let live.With same-sex marriage, for example, Australians are deciding whether the old rules of relationships should still be enforced, or loosened. The debate isn\u2019t just about competing arguments of freedom or fairness, or about what the word marriage should really mean; it\u2019s also about whether or not to change how Australians interact with each other.That question affects immigration too. The elevation of rules restricting access drives the refugee policy that led to the detention centers on Manus and Nauru. It\u2019s also what lets the country\u2019s leaders pat each other on the back for Australia\u2019s \u201cmulticultural society\u201d even as they work to add additional rules that make it harder to obtain citizenship, and insist that immigrants exhibit \u201cAustralian values,\u201d which mean just about anything that the establishment deems important.Indeed, I\u2019m often struck by the gap between white Australians who insist everyone is welcomed in Australia \u2014 no hyphenated identities here! \u2014 and the experience of immigrants or the children of immigrants who tell me the many ways they are treated as \u201cother\u201d and made to feel that their differences are unwelcome.This is hardly unique to Australia; immigrants and expanding ideas of sexuality and gender are challenging societal norms all over the world. And yet what\u2019s so interesting about the current moment in Australia are the ways that these forces \u2014 those defending the status quo, and challenging it \u2014 are colliding.Where, I often wonder, will Australia be in five or 10 years on its adherence to rules, and on these issues of sexuality and gender, and race and immigration?At our cottages, my daughter found her own middle ground. When offered a slice of bread to feed the kangaroos, she declined, but without comment. She did not defend the rules to those who may not have seen the signs (they had walked in from another area), nor did she violate the rules herself.Maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s something to be learned in that?What examples do you see in your own lives, or what ethical quandaries have you faced, that might help explain where Australia is heading?Now, here are our favorite stories from the past week, about Australia and not, followed by a recommendation.______The mass shooting in Las Vegas has once again brought tears, outrage and debates about American gun culture into our daily lives.______Hailing from Sydney, could they be \u201dthe greatest trio on earth?\u201d____________The segments are short, just a few minutes each, and will inject a touch of inspiration into your routine.\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to start the day,\u201d Bella says, \u201cto arrive at work seeing the good in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s almost as if these men are fighting to make abortion a crime because they\u2019re more invested in curtailing women\u2019s options and controlling their bodies than they are with saving innocent lives.Scandals roll by so frequently that there is, by now, an expected script: the shocking revelation, the tearful confession, the up-from-the-ashes reinstatement plea or re-election campaign, garlanded with declarations of \u201cGod/my wife/Willie Robertson, star of \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 has forgiven me, why can\u2019t you?\u201d Perhaps the most shocking part of Mr. Murphy\u2019s story is that he elected to quit, rather than scream \u201cFake news!\u201d or sit back and wait for a new story to eclipse his hypocrisy, as Mr. DesJarlais did.But what Mr. Murphy\u2019s moral flexibility ultimately reveals is that, for these particular hard-line anti-abortion politicians, it\u2019s not about fetal pain or the sanctity of life.

{"Headline": "When an Algorithm Helps Send You to Prison", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 2013, police officers in Wisconsin arrested a man driving a car that had been used in a recent shooting. The man, Eric Loomis, pleaded guilty to attempting to flee an officer, and no contest to operating a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent. Neither of his crimes mandates prison time.At Mr. Loomis\u2019s sentencing, the judge cited, among other factors, Mr. Loomis\u2019s high risk of recidivism as predicted by a computer program called COMPAS, a risk assessment algorithm used by the state of Wisconsin. The judge denied probation and prescribed an 11-year sentence: six years in prison, plus five years of extended supervision.No one knows exactly how COMPAS works; its manufacturer refuses to disclose the proprietary algorithm. We only know the final risk assessment score it spits out, which judges may consider at sentencing.Mr. Loomis challenged the use of an algorithm as a violation of his due process rights to be sentenced individually, and without consideration of impermissible factors like gender. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected his challenge. In June, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear his case, meaning a majority of justices effectively condoned the algorithm\u2019s use. Their decision will have far-ranging effects.Something about this story is fundamentally wrong: Why are we allowing a computer program, into which no one in the criminal justice system has any insight, to play a role in sending a man to prison?At a sentencing, it is entirely a judge\u2019s prerogative to prescribe a sentence within statutory guidelines. The obvious flaw with this system is bias. Judges might abuse this unchecked power to sentence based not only on relevant factors, such as the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s offense, but also on those that are morally and constitutionally problematic \u2014 for example, gender and race.But shifting the sentencing responsibility to a computer does not necessarily eliminate bias; it delegates and often compounds it.Algorithms like COMPAS simply mimic the data with which we train them. COMPAS\u2019s authors presumably fed historical recidivism data into their system. From that, the program ascertained what factors tend to make a defendant a higher risk. It then applied the patterns it gleaned to subsequent defendants, like Mr. Loomis, to spit out sentences that comport with existing trends.Even if you think Mr. Loomis\u2019s sentencing procedure arrived at the appropriate result, the potential that the process the state took to arrive there was biased \u2014 in ways neither judges nor defendants nor prosecutors know \u2014 should alarm anyone.Algorithms also lack the human ability to individualize. A computer cannot look a defendant in the eye, account for a troubled childhood or disability, and recommend a rehabilitative sentence. This is precisely the argument against mandatory minimum sentences \u2014 they rob judges of the discretion to deliver individualized justice \u2014 and it is equally cogent against machine sentencing.For example, algorithms are often programmed to assume unidirectional causation: If A, then B. But is it truly that defendants with higher rates of recidivism warrant longer sentences or is it that defendants with longer sentences are kept out of their communities, unemployed and away from their families longer, naturally increasing their recidivism risk? A judge could investigate this nuance.For now, the only people with visibility into COMPAS\u2019s functioning are its programmers, who are in many ways less equipped than judges to deliver justice. Judges have legal training, are bound by ethical oaths, and must account for not only their decisions but also their reasoning in published opinions. Programmers lack each of these safeguards.Computers may be intelligent, but they are not wise. Everything they know, we taught them, and we taught them our biases. They are not going to un-learn them without transparency and corrective action by humans.Advertisement"}

An ignored phone call from Mom. The Queen song \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me Now.\u201dAll of these are part of Toyota\u2019s marketing campaign for its new Camry. But which commercial you get to see may depend, in part, on what ethnicity you are.African-AmericanThis commercial of a black man driving is centered on the theme \u201cstrut,\u201d and features an image of a peacock and the entrance music of the wrestler John Cena.HispanicA Latino man enjoys his driving experience so much that he dares to decline a call from his mother, a move that the target audience is meant to see as rebellious.Asian-AmericanA  father picks up his daughter from baseball practice, a casting decision made to suggest that the Camry brings out the affectionate side of Asian-American fathers.\u2018Transcultural Mainstream\u2019A schoolboy, a young woman and a bespectacled man are each waiting for someone. Their counterparts are joyful and unworried as they drive with Queen playing.The company recently unveiled the numerous ads it had made for the car, several designed to resonate specifically with African-American, Hispanic or Asian-American audiences.People may see different commercials based on whether they are watching \u201cScandal\u201d on ABC, which tends to have a high number of African-American viewers, or a show on the Spanish-language network NBC Universo, according to the company\u2019s ad agencies. Some of the ads that are meant to appeal specifically to minorities will also run on programming that appeals to a general audience, like \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201dViewed together, the ads \u2014 and their different story lines, music and actors \u2014  offer a glimpse into how race and culture figure into American advertising today, showing how an ad for one product can evolve depending on who is making it and whom it is marketed to.\u201cPeople like to see people of all ethnicities in what they\u2019re seeing because that\u2019s the life they\u2019re living in most of the U.S. today,\u201d said Jack Hollis, group vice president and general manager of the Toyota brand.At the same time, added Mr. Hollis, who is white, \u201cif a person of any group is looking for communication that is like them, that looks like them specifically, the good news is because of the breadth of something like a Camry campaign, they can find it.\u201dCompanies have developed commercial campaigns aimed at minority groups for years, often in conjunction with specialized ad agencies. But Toyota\u2019s efforts show how major companies are adjusting their marketing tactics as the nation\u2019s demographics shift.Some wonder, though, if these kind of specialized ads are even needed when the country\u2019s population is getting more diverse.\u201cYou see a real blending and a more progressive acknowledgment that there is significant diversity\u201d in mainstream advertising, said Shalini Shankar, a professor at Northwestern University and the author of the book \u201cAdvertising Diversity.\u201d Still, she said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t hurt to have more stuff that acknowledges that race is real.\u201dThe Camry campaign was developed jointly by a group of four ad agencies \u2014 one general agency and three that specialize in each ethnic group. The agencies \u2014 Saatchi & Saatchi, Burrell Communications, Conill and interTrend \u2014 each aimed their ads at Americans 25 to 49 years old and built them around the theme \u201cSensations.\u201dFour of the eight commercials are below, along with explanations from each agency about what it was trying to accomplish in its marketing.The image of a peacock flashes after he opens the garage to reveal a red Camry, emphasizing the idea of showing off.He then drives past a movie theater whose marquee reads \u201cNow Showing Out,\u201d and he earns an admiring look from an African-American woman.\u201cWhat we found with African-Americans is style really comes to the forefront in how we look at vehicles,\u201d said Lewis Williams, Burrell's chief creative officer. \u201cWe see automobiles as extensions of ourselves, so style is really important.\u201dVicki Bolton, a group account director, added that the agency\u2019s research had led it to the idea of strutting, because \u201cwe wanted people to take notice of us.\u201dThe actor was cast to portray \u201csomeone who felt athletic, who had this space that he could feel like a guy\u2019s guy but could be a great father, someone who maybe moved to the suburbs and hadn\u2019t lost his edge totally because now he has a car,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt gave him his strut back.\u201dThe music was also chosen to signal confidence and athleticism, and to give the ad a contemporary feel.Mr. Williams and Ms. Bolton, who are both African-American, said the agency relied on research, personal knowledge and a philosophy called \u201cpositive realism\u201d to avoid stereotyping.\u201cWe always make sure we portray African-Americans in a positive light when we do any kind of media, as well as be very authentic to the stories we tell,\u201d Mr. Williams said.\u201cPeople want to see themselves in messaging,\u201d Ms. Bolton said. She added that millennials may have broader social circles, but that \u201cwhen they come home at the end of the day, they still want to see messaging with people that are reflective of them.\u201dIn the commercial titled \u201cCaptivating,\u201d a Chinese-American father picks his daughter up from baseball practice in a red Camry. She is focused on her tablet in the backseat until he turns Pandora on. As the music kicks up and the engine revs, both of their faces light up.The ad is from interTrend, a Long Beach, Calif., agency that specializes in marketing to Asian-Americans. It is the only Camry broadcast spot to focus on a father and daughter. The father was specifically cast to \u201chighlight a not-often-seen behavior,\u201d said Julia Huang, interTrend\u2019s chief executive, who is Taiwanese-American.\u201cTraditionally, Asian fathers show less emotion and affection toward their kids,\u201d Ms. Huang said. \u201cWe wanted to show that driving the Camry brought out a different side of an Asian dad and how he wanted to share the experience with his daughter.\u201dWhen asked about the potential pitfalls of perpetuating stereotypes through race-targeted ads, Ms. Huang said the word \u201chas a stigma\u201d attached to it. From a research perspective, she said, it is not stereotyping to say Asian-Americans view family and education as particularly important.\u201cI\u2019d like to say there is some value for value attributes that we pick up, and we highlight that,\u201d she said, \u201cso it\u2019s not really a stereotype \u2014 it really is a core value that is embraced.\u201dBaseball was chosen, Ms. Huang said, because it \u201cis a universally popular sport among all Asian segments.\u201d Others, like cricket, were dismissed as being \u201ctoo obvious.\u201dThe ad, called \"Rebellious,\u201d shows a young man in a red Camry zooming down a highway when he sees his mother is calling his phone. He hesitates before deciding to decline the call, breaking into a smile and focusing on the joy of the drive.This commercial, which is in Spanish, is one of two from Conill, which markets to a Hispanic audience.Conill, which creates ads in both English and Spanish, approaches its work by considering how \u201cacculturated\u201d its target consumers are, said Jennifer Dellapina, group strategic planning director at Conill. It uses a model that \u201ctakes into account how long a person was in the United States, if they were born here, which language they speak, which culture they tend to feel more connected to,\u201d she said.When Toyota\u2019s agencies gathered, they concluded that potential Camry buyers were broadly ready for change, though the Hispanic consumer sought \u201csome guardrails\u201d with that effort, Ms. Dellapina, who is white, said. That came from a sense of responsibility, particularly to family, she said, adding that \u201cinternally, we called it \u2018soaring with sense.\u2019\u201dThat insight is reflected in the ad when the man declines the call, which Ms. Dellapina called an \u201cedgy move.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a Hispanic thing \u2014 you\u2019re going to talk to your mom once a week,\u201d she said. Still, ignoring the call isn\u2019t too radical of a move.\u201cHe\u2019s not jumping off a cliff or burning down his house \u2014 he\u2019s just not answering the call from his mom, and it\u2019s sort of implied in my mind that he\u2019s going to call her back later,\u201d Ms. Dellapina said.She applies red lipstick before strolling out of her red Camry to her final destination: a supermarket. The idea is to bring style wherever you go, Ms. Dellapina said.All of the characters in Conill\u2019s commercials \u201care everyday people who portray different situations based on strong Hispanic insights, like the Latino woman who always wants to look and feel attractive \u2014 even when she is just doing the everyday tasks,\u201d the firm said in an email.It shows a schoolboy, a young woman with bangs and a bearded man with glasses each waiting impatiently for someone to arrive. Their counterparts \u2014 a father, a significant other and a female colleague \u2014 appear to have forgotten about their duties as they enjoy separate, unworried joyrides in a Camry, until their phones ring and a reunion takes place. The six actors appear to be a mix of white and nonwhite.The agency recoils at the notion that, by default, its ads may be designed to appeal first and foremost to white people.\u201cThere is no Caucasian market,\u201d said Mark Turner, chief strategy officer of Saatchi & Saatchi, who is white. \u201cThe mainstream market as defined by any mass marketer like Toyota actually comprises many different cultures, so we\u2019re not the Caucasian agency. We\u2019re the agency that caters to the transcultural mainstream.\u201dOutside of Queen, the commercials use songs like \u201cThe Look\u201d by Roxette and \u201cWhat a Wonderful World,\u201d and show a variety of ethnicities among actors.\u201cWe wanted every person in our campaign to be relatable, but we didn\u2019t want people to get to know them too much,\u201d said Jason Schragger, chief creative officer of Saatchi & Saatchi, who is white.The ads sought to use familiar places, like the office and road trips, to highlight excitement around the car and its features.\u201cI have people of other cultures and heritages in my department, but I do think the three other agencies bring a depth and history of experience with their markets that would be very hard to replicate overnight by going out and hiring a handful of people or half the agency,\u201d Mr. Turner said.Culture, he added, \u201cis a very complicated and hard thing to understand and get right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But with that comes an extreme competition to be the best in each field.If you can make it here \u2026 well, you know the rest.As part of an occasional series on jobs in the city, we are reaching out to influential and successful New Yorkers who excel in their chosen fields, to learn how they got there.To kick off the series, we met up with Javier Mu\u00f1oz, who plays Alexander Hamilton in the musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d on a recent morning at his apartment in Astoria, Queens. As he prepared for his day, we asked him about his job on Broadway. (His responses have been edited down.)How does someone get started in your field?There\u2019s no typical route. But there are training programs, and you can go to a conservatory, if you\u2019re fortunate enough to afford that. Then you have a degree. Since you don\u2019t have experience or credits, a degree is your business card and that\u2019s how you get into the room. But then you have to show up and not suck (laughs).How do you avoid burnout?You don\u2019t. Burnout happens and it\u2019s really awful. For me, it manifests in forgetting lines on stage or forgetting appointments. That\u2019s when I will take a mental health day. I\u2019ll cancel whatever I have to cancel and I will go in that room (pointing to bedroom), lie down and I will not leave. I turn this off (picks up phone). No social media, no updates about anything. The other thing I do is call Mom and Dad, or call any of my brothers, or see a friend.What is your advice to newcomers?Know why you\u2019re doing this. And I mean really know, because it\u2019s tested all the time.Also, I think it\u2019s wise to have other interests. You\u2019re not going to be on stage all the time. Other interests keep you inspired. They keep your mind working and they keep you engaged with other people. They are going to feed the artist that you are.And the other piece of advice I have is: Don\u2019t underestimate the value of keeping yourself healthy, strong and well.What do newcomers to the industry not understand about your job?Leadership. Any artist in this position, where you are the title character, you have to go beyond just showing up and doing your job. It doesn\u2019t matter how I\u2019m feeling, it\u2019s about what does everyone else need. It\u2019s showing up to events and being asked to represent your show in ways you never thought you\u2019d be asked. And you have to be ready for that.Have a suggestion for a job, and person who excels at it, whom you\u2019d like us to learn more about?

Some comments were edited for length and clarity.Sure, I go to school with a bunch of teenage boys. I know how stupid boys are. But currently, because I\u2019m being told that my shoulder or the strap of my bra is distracting a boy from their school work, boys are not learning what consent is. Girls are also being told that they should be ashamed of themselves. Because boys in my grade haven\u2019t learned to respect females, or hold themselves back from girls, there is a chance that someone in my grade will sexually assault a girl. So, schools should try their best to teach boys that they need consent from a girl, and vice versa. All in all, sexual assault is not O.K., and if a teenager can understand that, there is no reason a fully grown adult can\u2019t.I really hope this is a tipping point where we can finally look back and say this is when it changed. I hope men who wrongfully use their power are terrified that Weinstein was fired from his own company. I hope men stop using similar excuses like Weinstein\u2019s that he \u201ccame of age in the \u201960s and \u201970s.\u201d That\u2019s not even an excuse.

{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s Ad System Works", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySimilar ad purchases by Russian agents were also uncovered on other internet services like Google and Twitter.The online ads in question do not necessarily fit the traditional idea of advertising, and Facebook\u2019s ads are particularly unusual.Facebook\u2019s primary ad system plugs straight into the Facebook News Feed, the stream of information that serves as the primary interface for the social network. This system was created to deliver ads that could grab your attention as effectively as what internet companies call \u201corganic content\u201d \u2014 posts from your friends and family and other entities you are connected to on Facebook.Indeed, ads are often the same as organic content, just with money behind them. \u201cThere is an ad-selling mechanism, but the ad itself isn\u2019t really an ad. It\u2019s content,\u201d said Ron Berman, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton business school who studies online advertising, including the Facebook ad system.Facebook was part of a gradual but significant change in online advertising over the past decade. As more people have moved more of their online activity from PCs to mobile phones, the lines between ads and organic content have continued to blur, particularly on popular social networking service like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.Mobile phones offer less room on their screens for ads. Usually, there is only space for a single column of information, and that must accommodate both ads and other content. The result is that ads have moved into a more prominent position.Consider the Google search engine. If you type the word \u201cSamsung\u201d into Google on a laptop, a Samsung ad is likely to appear at the top of the screen, above the list of search results chosen by Google. But if you do the same thing on a typical smartphone, the ad is likely to take up the entire screen.These are Facebook pages built by businesses and other organizations on the social network. Facebook allows businesses and other advertisers to serve pages straight into the News Feeds of people they had no other connection to, targeting their particular interests and behavior.As these pages appear, people can comment on them and \u201clike\u201d them, just as they can with anything else that shows up in their feeds. And if people click the like button, these pages will continue to show up in their feeds \u2014 and the feeds of their Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d \u2014 for free.On Facebook, people describe themselves and leave all sorts of digital bread crumbs that show their interests. Then Facebook matches these with other data it collects.Facebook\u2019s ad system provides ways to target geographic locations, personal interests, characteristics and behavior, including activity on other internet services and even in physical stores. Advertisers can target people based on their political affiliation; how likely they are to engage with political content; whether they like to jog, hike or hunt; what kind of beer they like; and so on.If advertisers provide a list for email addresses, Facebook can try to target the people those addresses belong to. It can also do what is called \u201clook-alike matching.\u201d In this case, Facebook\u2019s algorithms serve ads to people believed to be similar to the people those addresses belong to.Like Google and others, Facebook runs an instant digital auction for each ad placement, considering bid prices from many advertisers. An advertiser might bid $2 to place an ad in a particular situation. Then Facebook weighs these bids against how relevant the ad is to that situation. If an ad is relevant, the advertiser need not bid as high to win the auction.Unlike similar services, Facebook does not just consider how relevant an ad is next to the other available ads. It considers how relevant an ad is next to all other content, and it chooses ads based on how well they compete for attention with organic posts.Google says it runs separate teams and separate technology for organic content and ads. The algorithm for organic content does not consider ads, and vice versa.Facebook\u2019s arrangement is a little different because the ad auction considers organic content as well. Ads are also reviewed by a mix of algorithms and human moderators to determine if they are breaking company policies. Facebook recently said it would add 1,000 more human moderators to the team that reviews ads.By the fall of 2015, the Facebook ad engine was also driving ads on Instagram, which the company had acquired three years earlier. Twitter works a bit differently from these services, but the dynamic is similar. Twitter ads are merely posts that business and others pay to place in the feeds of individuals who match certain criteria.As all these companies point out, paid advertisements are labeled ads or \u201csponsored\u201d or \u201cpromoted\u201d content. Facebook executives add that ads also usually include some sort of call to action, such as \u201cLiking\u201d a page.Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ads products, said in a statement that the people who manage content from regular users and people who manage ads coordinate their work but operate in separate organizations, with different goals and policies.\u201cOur goal is to make ads on Facebook just as useful and relevant as posts people see from friends and family,\u201d Mr. Goldman said. \u201cBut we also want people to know when they\u2019re looking at an ad, so we clearly label them as sponsored.\u201dBut the line between ads and content has blurred in ways that may not be obvious. If you \u201clike\u201d an ad, for example, posts from the same account will turn up in your feed automatically, without paid promotion \u2014 and without the \u201csponsored\u201d tags.These posts are not just free advertising, Mr. Berman said, but also something that people see as more credible and that Facebook is more likely share in the feeds of these people\u2019s \u201cfriends.\u201d On a service like Facebook, the effect of an ad can extend well beyond what an advertiser paid for.It\u2019s not clear. Facebook said about 10 million people had seen the ads.Mr. Berman said that published academic studies, including one of his own, indicated that people were more likely to share sensational content \u2014 content that generates an emotional response. That could include posts related to gun control, gay rights or race relations.If an advertiser posts an ad that is widely shared, this is still more free advertising. And from the perspective of the Facebook ad engine, that is a relevant ad. This means the cost of the next ad goes down. And the cycle continues.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tastes That Are Distinctly Bangladeshi in Queens", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City8 PhotosIt is time to praise the Bangladeshi steam table, with its crammed bins, trays, casserole dishes and china bowls; its stacks of cilantro-flecked kebabs as long as hot dogs; its rolling mountains of rice in sepia and saffron, studded with whole peeled hard-boiled eggs and looking ready to tumble.What I craved most was shutki vorta, a rough crush of little dried fish that start out as hard and skinny as licorice and are broken down just enough to grow soft and slightly fluffy. It\u2019s a small, briny cloud, with swift jabs of chile and a leavening bite of cilantro, that tastes as much of the sun as of the depths.On the steam table, hilsa is served alongside tilapia and rui, a member of the carp family, clean and delicate. They might come curried and strewn with creamy flat beans; or gently stewed with trunks of eggplant; or swarmed twice over with onions, one batch charred until swampily sweet and a second batch tossed in late so the flavor stays keen.The chef, Shahara Khan, has roots in Narsingdi, just outside of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. She spent years cooking at other restaurants in Queens while dreaming of her own, and opened Boishakhi two years ago with the help of her son, Tozammel Tanzil; her daughter, Shamsun Rimi; and Ms. Rimi\u2019s husband, Abu Taher Atip.She keeps the steam table stocked with scarlet-tinged goat curry \u2014 the meat still clinging to nubs of bone, not yet reconciled to submitting to the teeth \u2014 and tabs of beef stomach that tug and slip. Goat hunks bob in a loose dal, and more are buried in kacchi biryani, which is offered only a few days a week because it takes five hours to make, the meat and rice layered raw and cooked under a lid sealed with dough, so no heat escapes.For balance, there are unfussy heaps of gutted string beans, potato strips fried to shining but not stiffness, and carrots and cabbage halfway between collapse and crunch. And more vortas (mashes), including potato scooped like ice cream, with flares of red onion and stray chile seeds, and eggplant brought almost to a burn, for lingering smoke.Chile brings an insistent thrust to every dish, sometimes a scorch and quick retreat, sometimes a steady radiance. Whole green chiles are available on request and arrive in small saucers to sear the palate clean.Boishakhi is more cafeteria than restaurant. Diners point to what they want, then find spots on banquettes. The menu is spoken only; for those unfamiliar with the cuisine, the servers will patiently name each dish and occasionally attempt to deflect interest. (Regarding hilsa: \u201ctoo many bones.\u201d)Diners find spots on banquettes along the unadorned walls to wait for their food, which is presented on a mix of china and paper plates. (Mine always came with a tiny iceberg lettuce salad on the side, shrouded in plastic wrap.) A larger room downstairs, lit by chandeliers that shift from purple to pink, is reserved for parties or offered to women who feel more comfortable dining unseen by men they do not know.Desserts await unlabeled in the freezer case. One night, a young man shook his head at what I\u2019d chosen and reached in for a bin of mishti doi, milk boiled and thickened, stained orange by caramelized sugar and left to ferment overnight. It was tangy and sweet, each flavor holding the other in check, and my spoon carved into it as if it were cheesecake.Advertisement"}

Clauses that keep customers out of the courts have caused reputational problems for Wall Street before, and will again.Industry lobbying paid off when the Senate overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on Tuesday night. The measure was proposed by Richard Cordray, the head of the agency, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama. Mr. Cordray argued that consumers needed protection from fine print forcing them to rely on private arbitration, which often favors the firms, when they feel they have been wronged. Banks said the rule would increase costs for consumers.Their celebration could be short-lived. Equifax, the credit-scoring agency, had to drop its arbitration clause for the 145.5 million consumers who may have been affected by a data breach it disclosed in September, after public pressure and threats from state attorneys general. And after Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million unauthorized accounts for customers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers slammed the bank for wanting to settle disputes through arbitration.Before the vote, the industry had been enjoying a respite from the wrath of Democrats and other critics in Washington. Wall Street wasn\u2019t even mentioned in the Democratic platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Instead, the party focused on big tech companies like Facebook, questioning whether they needed further antitrust regulations.The Senate vote reignited their ire, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, calling it \u201ca giant wet kiss to Wall Street.\u201d Bashing banks is also still in style among the populist base that elevated Donald J. Trump to the presidency. The shrinking political target on the backs of banks is set to grow again.Advertisement"}

Today, she is a software developer, working remotely from Lagos for a start-up in New York, and she dreams of starting her own tech company someday.Ms. Komolafe, a 27-year-old Nigerian, is one of hundreds of young Africans who have joined Andela, a fast-growing start-up based in New York that has attracted the attention and money of people like the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and works with blue-chip companies like Mastercard.The company\u2019s ambitious agenda spans education, economic development and moneymaking. It is betting on its ability to build out a talent pipeline of African software developers to the United States and elsewhere, tapping into a continent eager to connect to the global digital economy.Jeremy Johnson, Andela\u2019s chief executive, says the company offers \u201ca very different model for unlocking human potential.\u201dNot only does Andela instruct people in person, but 20,000 aspiring programmers across Africa have used its free online learning and training tools. By 2024, Andela hopes to have helped prepare 100,000 software developers in Africa for jobs, including thousands working for Andela.After six months of paid training, the Andela employees become remote members of software development teams at companies.

The new investment was announced on Tuesday.During a tour of Africa last year, Mr. Zuckerberg visited Andela\u2019s Lagos office and told the employees, \u201cYou are all part of something that\u2019s really important.\u201dSpark Capital and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative were the lead investors in two earlier rounds of funding for Andela. CRE Venture Capital, based in Cape Town, South Africa, is the lead investor in the new $40 million round, the largest venture round led by an African firm, said Pule Taukobong, a founding partner of CRE Venture Capital.Andela began with a founding team of six \u2014 three Africans, two Americans and a Canadian \u2014 and an initial test class of four students. It now employs 800 people, and it expects to double that number in the next year. While it has its headquarters in New York and a small office in San Francisco, 90 percent of its workers are in Africa, with offices in Lagos; Nairobi, Kenya; and Kampala, Uganda.Though growing fast, Andela has been highly selective. Applicants undergo dozens of online drills to assess everything from technical ability to personality type. About 3 percent of the applicants are invited to a two-week boot camp, and a final cut takes the acceptance rate below 1 percent.The new hires get a MacBook computer, subsidized housing and two meals a day during their six-month training program. In that time, Andela invests $15,000 in each developer. Starting salaries are low, but after the developers begin working as billable contractors for companies, their pay rises, up to $30,000 or so, comparable to salaries for young professionals in Africa\u2019s urban centers.Andela makes money much like consulting or law firms. It charges clients per worker, with part passed on to the worker as salary and Andela collecting the remainder. The company declined to detail its billing practices.Andela\u2019s recruits sign contracts for two years, but are expected to stay for four years. That longevity is part of the business model, since the work of developers on contract to customers helps pay to recruit and train new hires. So far, the retention rate is 98 percent.None of the developers have hit the four-year threshold yet. Andela would be happy to have them stay beyond that, but it is also encouraging them to go work for other companies or start their own. It is setting up an Andela accelerator to nurture alumni start-ups.\u201cWe want them to go out to become leading entrepreneurs and leading technologists in Africa,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.The Andela developers are young \u2014 the average age is under 25 \u2014 and 70 percent have computer science or engineering degrees. But university curriculums in Africa, technologists say, tend to emphasize theory rather than modern programming tools and the techniques of fast-paced software development in teams.Last year, the company needed more engineering talent to expand. But with Google and Facebook hiring in Austin, the company did not want to compete in the escalating bidding war for local talent, said Meetesh Karia, Zebra\u2019s chief technology officer.Instead, it gave Andela a try.The developers, Mr. Karia said, have worked out well \u2014 aided in part by Andela\u2019s customized approach to outsourcing.Andela sends its developers to customer sites to meet people and learn about the client\u2019s business. Mr. Oshodi spent a month in Austin last year, and recently finished another three-week visit. He and the other Adela programmers have been invited to backyard barbecues and nights out in downtown Austin.\u201cThey know my family. They know my kids,\u201d Mr. Karia said. \u201cThey are really part of the team.\u201dThe Andela developers are on the same corporate mailing lists and chat channels as Zebra employees. When back in Africa, the Andela members of the team participate in the daily \u201cstand-up meeting,\u201d where developers talk about their work and plans, usually via a video link.One of the initial group of developers, Mr. Karia said, did not work out. But Andela soon replaced that person. Now, Mr. Karia said, \u201cI would love to hire all eight\u201d when their four-year commitments to Andela are over.Mr. Oshodi\u2019s four-year clock runs out in 2019. Until then, he said, he wants to steadily enhance his product development and management skills. He has not decided what comes next, but he is optimistic.\u201cIf you put yourself in a good place,\u201d Mr. Oshodi said, \u201copportunity comes.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meticulous Planning by Las Vegas Gunman Before He Opened Fire", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt 10:07 p.m. on Sunday, the gunman opened fire on the thousands of people attending a country music festival a few hundred yards northeast of the hotel, firing long, rapid-fire bursts as people screamed and ran for their lives. He killed 59 people \u2014 the coroner clarified on Tuesday that the number included Mr. Paddock, along with his 58 victims \u2014 and wounded hundreds of others. In all, more than 500 people were injured, most by gunfire, and some in the panicked rush to escape.President Trump, who is expected to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, said on Tuesday that Mr. Paddock was \u201ca sick man, a demented man,\u201d adding that \u201cwe are dealing with a very, very sick individual.\u201d He said there would be some discussion about firearms legislation, but was not specific.\u201cWe will be talking about gun laws as time goes by,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he prepared to leave Washington for hurricane-battered Puerto Rico.Police officials said that Mr. Paddock, 64, had set up two cameras in the hallway, including one on a service cart, and a third camera over the suite door peephole.His suite held more than 20 guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\u201cI anticipate he was looking for anybody coming to take him into custody,\u201d the sheriff said.According to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, investigators also were looking into whether Mr. Paddock had planned an earlier attack in Las Vegas before deciding to target the concert Sunday night.Mr. Paddock checked in on Thursday and kept the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign on his door for the next three days, so no maids entered the rooms, according to a hotel worker, who also was not authorized to discuss the matter. Housekeepers are allowed to enter a room with such a sign only in the presence of a security guard, and it happens rarely, usually after several days, the worker said.The hotel staff is trained to look for anything suspicious, but the gunman\u2019s behavior did not set off any alarms, the employee said. He had at least 10 suitcases in his room, the sheriff had said, which might have been used to bring the guns in without notice. But the hotel worker said it would have been easy to bring them to the room a few at a time without arousing suspicion.Semiautomatic rifles, like those the gunman had, are made to fire a single round with each pull of the trigger. But recordings and witness accounts of the shooting made clear that Mr. Paddock was firing much faster, at a rate comparable to that of a fully automatic weapon, which quickly fires round after round with a single pull of the finger. Undersheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas police said that Mr. Paddock fired on the concertgoers for nine to 11 minutes, in about a dozen bursts.Replacing the standard rifle stock, which rests against the user\u2019s shoulder, with a bump stock like the ones Mr. Paddock had, allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire much more rapidly, like an automatic, firing hundreds of rounds per minute. The devices are usually legal and inexpensive, with some versions advertised for $99.A bump stock allows the body of the rifle to slide a short distance back and forth, harnessing the recoil energy of each shot. The weapon bounces, or \u201cbumps,\u201d rapidly between shoulder and finger, essentially creating the action of repeated trigger pulls without the gunman having to move the trigger finger.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, a Democrat, has called for years for a ban on bump stocks, and she renewed that call on Tuesday, writing on Facebook, \u201cThis is the least we should do.\u201d Congressional Democrats asked their Republican counterparts to establish a special committee to investigate gun violence.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, rebuffed questions about potential legislative action during his regular news conference Tuesday afternoon, saying that the massacre was being politicized.How one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history unfolded.\u201cLook, the investigation\u2019s not even been completed,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any.\u201dMr. Paddock was an avid gambler who often bet heavily at the major casino hotels, and Ms. Danley, 62, had worked for some of those hotels. They lived in Mesquite, Nev., 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, and he also owned a home in Reno.The police have found a total of 47 firearms in his two houses and his hotel suite. Jill A. Snyder, the special agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said that almost all had been traced, and that they had been bought in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas.Leaked photos that showed parts of the scene inside and outside the hotel suite, including Mr. Paddock\u2019s body, his rifles and spent ammunition shells on the floor, began circulating online Tuesday.\u201cWhat I can tell you is I\u2019m very troubled by it,\u201d Sheriff Lombardo said of the leaks, which his agency was investigating.The police did release a video, a compilation of footage from officers\u2019 body cameras, showing the chaos as Mr. Paddock began firing on the crowd.\u201cHey, you guys, get down!\u201d one officer shouted at bystanders between volleys of gunfire. \u201cThere are gunshots coming from over there. Go that way!\u201dAnalysis of video shows that the gunman used rifles with rapid-fire capabilities, and an official reports of one modified with a \u201cbump stock.\u201dAmid confusion about where the blasts were coming from, some people rebuffed requests to evacuate. \u201cThat\u2019s fireworks!\u201d one shouted at officers. Another yelled expletives.As sirens blared and gunfire crackled, the video showed officers straining to find the source of the shots.\u201cHey, they\u2019re shooting right at us, guys!\u201d one officer said as he and his colleagues crouched behind a wall with their weapons drawn. \u201cEverybody stay down, stay down!\u201d\u201cNorth of the Mandalay Bay, it\u2019s coming out of a window!\u201d another officer said.Law enforcement officials have said they are confident that Mr. Paddock, who had no prior criminal record, was the sole gunman on Sunday. Though the Islamic State group has claimed that he was one of its followers, officials say that they have found no evidence so far that he had ties to any extremist group.But Mr. Lombardo stressed that investigators were still looking into what roles others might have played. \u201cI assure you this investigation is not ended with the demise of Mr. Paddock,\u201d he said.Asked if Ms. Danley was considered a suspect, he said, \u201cCurrently she\u2019s a person of interest.\u201dOfficials with the Philippine Immigration Bureau and the aviation police said Ms. Danley flew on Tuesday from Manila to the United States.Mr. Paddock recently wired thousands of dollars to the Philippines, but it was not clear who the recipient was.His work history was not completely clear; his brother has described him as a wealthy retiree. Mr. Paddock worked for the federal government for roughly 10 years, from 1975 to 1985, a spokeswoman for the Office of Personnel Management confirmed.Investigators unearthed multiple job applications, with Mr. Paddock\u2019s fingerprints on file, as part of records reflecting his employment as a letter carrier for the Postal Service in the mid 1970s; as an Internal Revenue Service agent from 1978 to 1984; and as an auditor focused on defense contracts, a job he held until 1985. He also worked in the 1980s for one of the companies that later combined to form Lockheed Martin, the aerospace contractor.Jennifer Medina reported from Las Vegas and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a and Adam Goldman from New York.

That is the sort of story the tech industry loves to tell about itself: It is bringing freedom, enlightenment and a better future for all mankind.Their amount of concentrated authority resembles the divine right of kings, and is sparking a backlash that is still gathering force.\u201cFor 10 years, the arguments in tech were about which chief executive was more like Jesus. Which one was going to run for president. Who did the best job convincing the work force to lean in,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cNow sentiments are shifting. The worm has turned.\u201dUnderlying the meet-and-greets is the reality that the internet long ago became a business, which means the companies\u2019 first imperative is to do right by their stockholders.\u201cFor all the lip service that Silicon Valley has given to changing the world, its ultimate focus has been on what it can monetize,\u201d Mr. Baird said.\u201cThe result?\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery voice is heard. The cacophony more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harassment and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen.\u201dSuch complaints, repeated at regular intervals, did not stop the tech world from seizing the moment. Millions and then billions of people flocked to its services. The chief executives were regarded as sages. Disruption was the highest good.Mr. Rosenstein, a co-founder of Asana, an office productivity start-up, said in an email that he had banned not just Facebook but also the Safari and Chrome browsers, Gmail and other applications.\u201cI realized that I spend a lot of time mindlessly interacting with my phone in ways that aren\u2019t serving me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook is a very powerful tool that I continue to use every day, just with more mindfulness.\u201dIf social media is on the defensive, Mr. Zuckerberg is particularly on the spot \u2014 a rare event in a golden career that has made him, at 33, one of the richest and most influential people on the planet.\u201cWe have a saying: \u2018Move fast and break things,\u2019\u201d he wrote in his 2012 manifesto. \u201cThe idea is that if you never break anything, you\u2019re probably not moving fast enough.\u201dFacebook dropped that motto two years later, but critics say too much of the implicit arrogance has lingered. Mr. Galloway, whose new book, \u201cThe Four,\u201d analyzes the power of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, said the social media network was still fumbling its response.\u201cZuckerberg and Facebook are violating the No. 1 rule of crisis management: Overcorrect for the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir attitude is that anything that damages their profits is impossible for them to do.\u201dJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, said the network was doing its best.\u201cFacebook is an important part of many people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous responsibility \u2014 and one that we take incredibly seriously.\u201dSome social media entrepreneurs acknowledge that they are confronting issues they never imagined as employees of start-ups struggling to survive.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to think through the repercussions of everything we did,\u201d Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, said in an interview shortly before he rejoined the service last spring.He maintained that Twitter was getting an unfair rap: \u201cFor every bad thing, there are a thousand good things.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that sometimes \u201cit gets a little messy.\u201dDespite the swell of criticism, the vast majority of investors, consumers and regulators seem not to have changed their behavior. People still eagerly await the new iPhone. Facebook has more than two billion users. President Trump likes to criticize Amazon on Twitter, but his administration ignored pleas for a rigorous examination of Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods.\u201cThis war, like so many wars, is going to start in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor.For some tech companies, the new power is a heavy weight. Cloudflare, which provides many sites with essential protection from hacking, made its first editorial decision in August: It lifted its protection from The Daily Stormer, basically expunging the neo-Nazi site from the visible web.\u201cIncreasingly tech companies are going to be put into the position of making these sorts of judgments,\u201d said Matthew Prince, Cloudflare\u2019s chief executive.The picture is likely to get even more complicated. Mr. Prince foresees several possible dystopian futures. One is where every search engine has a political point of view, and users gravitate toward the one they feel most comfortable with. That would further balkanize the internet.Another possibility is the opposite extreme: Under the pressure of regulation, all hate speech \u2014 and eventually all dissent \u2014 is filtered out.\u201cPeople are realizing that technology isn\u2019t neutral,\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cI used to travel to Europe to hear these fears.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. to Loosen Rules on Local Media Ownership", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices.The commission\u2019s chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion.But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated. They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google.\u201cThe marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975,\u201d Mr. Pai said.It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry. Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry.The announcement on Wednesday, at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing, pleased newspaper groups and broadcast stations, which have lobbied for changes that they say are necessary to compete with online media giants like YouTube and Facebook.\u201cThe news media industry must have economies of scale to compete in today\u2019s marketplace and to reinvest in reporters and news-gathering operations that maintain an informed democracy and a functioning society,\u201d said David Chavern, president of the newspaper trade group News Media Alliance, of which The New York Times is a member.But consumer groups have denounced Mr. Pai\u2019s fervor for deregulation of the media industry. He has argued that he is trying to create a more level playing field for traditional and online media. But broadcast television remains a popular source of news for most Americans, and consumer groups fear that the aggressive elimination of rules will lead to a few giant corporations like Sinclair or the Walt Disney Company controlling the vast majority of TV content.\u201cAjit Pai\u2019s announcement today is the most retrograde I have ever heard from an F.C.C. chairman.\u201d said Michael Copps, a former Democratic commissioner of the F.C.C. and a special adviser to the nonprofit watchdog Common Cause. \u201cApparently, he has lost all sense of self-restraint.

On\u00a0police radios, they were\u00a0minutes of confusion and coordination, as emergency responders scanned the gleaming facade of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and raced up its stairwell, trying to get to the gunman before the next volley of gunfire.When the shooting\u00a0stopped, another hour passed before the gunman, Stephen\u00a0Paddock, was found dead in the luxury suite that he had turned into a killing perch.\u00a0A\u00a0total of 79\u00a0minutes\u00a0elapsed\u00a0from 10:08 p.m., when the shooting was first reported, to 11:27\u00a0p.m., when a SWAT team burst through the door of Mr. Paddock\u2019s room on the 32nd floor. After killing 58 and wounding about 500 more, he appeared to have shot himself in the head.Audio\u00a0recordings\u00a0of emergency\u00a0workers\u2019\u00a0cross talk and videos and interviews from the scene show a night when police officers quickly focused on a window in the Mandalay Bay, and\u00a0pinpointed Mr. Paddock\u2019s location when he fired through the door at a hotel security officer.\u00a0Still, they waited until they had cleared\u00a0the\u00a0surrounding\u00a0hotel\u00a0rooms\u00a0and assembled\u00a0a SWAT team before\u00a0trying to\u00a0confront\u00a0him.As they moved into place, the concertgoers below were running for their lives. The police department and\u00a0the Clark County Fire Department began receiving the first calls for help at 10:08 p.m. Within seconds, some emergency\u00a0workers\u00a0were already pinpointing Mandalay Bay as the source of the shots. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from upstairs in the Mandalay Bay,\u201d one responder said over the police scanner. \u201cUpstairs in the Mandalay Bay, halfway up I see the shots coming from Mandalay Bay, halfway up.\u201dSome concertgoers thought the gunshots were fireworks or firecrackers and seemed unfazed, while others began to run immediately. Body camera footage released by the police department shows that despite the initial confusion, some officers were able to identify the sound as gunshots as well as the general direction of fire. They shouted at the crowd to get down, or to run, as they crouched behind a concrete wall.\u201cThat\u2019s fireworks! Not gunshots!\u201d one person in the crowd yelled back.Nikki Davis, 22, first thought the shots were fireworks \u2014 but there were no lights, she noted. Then, after a second burst,\u00a0she thought it might be\u00a0a power surge.\u00a0But, after the music stopped, she ran and hid under a table. In a video she took while huddled there, no one could decide whether the best choice was to stay or run. \u201cGet out, get out now, you guys!\u201d one person says. \u201cNo, no. Stay here,\u201d another responds.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d another voice says, as someone else moans in fear.The firing would not stop. People on the concert grounds were falling where they stood. Those who were still upright had to make an instant, life-or-death decision:\u00a0Hide or run?Melissa Ayala, 41, and her friends did not realize that the gunshots were not fireworks until a man near them was grazed by a bullet and fell to the ground, blood leaking from his neck.\u201cIt was just total chaos.

Those were the choices.\u201dAn on-site medical supervisor for Community Ambulance, which was providing emergency medical services at the festival, requested multiple ambulance units from the company dispatcher. Community Ambulance dispatch notified the Fire Alarm Office, which handles 911 fire and medical calls for the area, about the situation.Crouching behind a concrete wall, police officers heard over their radios what was becoming increasingly apparent to all the security personnel in the area: Someone was firing from a window midway up one of the towers.On the scanner, one officer said he was going to form a \u201cstrike team\u201d outside\u00a0Mandalay Bay.\u00a0At 10:12, two officers arrived on the 31st floor.\u00a0But confusion\u00a0persisted about where exactly the gunfire was coming from, with one officer suggesting that it could be from the\u00a0nearby\u00a0Luxor\u00a0hotel, and another reporting, incorrectly, that there were shots fired at one of the concert gates.The only certainty was that the injuries and deaths were still mounting. \u201cWe have multiple casualties.

On the 32nd floor, where Mr. Paddock had been staying, some guests left their rooms and ran down the hallway to the elevators in bare feet. Even as police officers closed in on Mr. Paddock\u2019s room, however, uncertainty persisted about whether he was the only\u00a0gunman.\u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons,\u201d an emergency responder said on the scanner at 10:27 p.m. The scanner also crackled with false reports of shots at\u00a0other hotels.\u00a0Some officers did not know for hours whether the festival area was secure.\u201cI was hearing traffic on the radio all night about shots at the Tropicana, shots at Caesar\u2019s,\u201d said Travis Smaka,\u00a0a trooper with Nevada Highway Patrol. \u201cShots were being reported everywhere, it was impossible to know what was really going on. People were going in every direction and victims were all over. I spent the whole night thinking we were under attack.\u201dBut the threat was just Mr. Paddock, and he had stopped shooting. Several emergency responders remarked in the minutes after 10:19 p.m. that they had not heard any shots in some time.The closest major trauma center, Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, received word of the shooting from the police at 10:20 p.m., and activated its mass-casualty system one minute later.On Tuesday evening, Mr. McMahill was defensive as he described the period between the final shots and the SWAT team\u2019s arrival. \u201cWhile there was that slight delay, the suspect was no longer firing into the crowd,\u201d he said.With the floor secured and Mr. Paddock isolated by 10:58 p.m., according to audio from the police scanner, a SWAT team exploded two door-breaching devices, then broke in at 11:27 p.m. They found Mr. Paddock, dead of what seemed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, lying on the carpet among his guns, shell casings and ammunition.Sheri Fink, Adam Goldman and William K.

{"Headline": "Sheryl Sandberg Blitzes Washington in P.R. Push for Facebook", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For months, Facebook has been trying to counter criticism about its influence on the 2016 presidential election. The company has hired three crisis communications firms and has bought digital and newspaper ads. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has posted live video to the social network to explain how much he cared about election integrity.This week, it sent Sheryl Sandberg to Washington to charm Congress and the public.Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, acted as the giant tech company\u2019s chief ambassador in the capital on Wednesday and Thursday \u2014 shuttling around to talk with dozens of lawmakers, and making numerous promises about how the company would change.In a public appearance hosted by Axios, the news start-up, she admitted that Facebook had made mistakes during the presidential campaign. She offered lawmakers who are investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the election more data from the company. And she promised the Congressional Black Caucus that she would help appoint an African-American to the Facebook board.\u201cShe said 10 to 15 times, \u2018We\u2019ve got to do better,\u2019\u201d Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democrat from Missouri, said after Ms. Sandberg met with the Congressional Black Caucus, which has complained about the level of diversity at the company.In addition to the new crisis communications firms, the company has placed ads in places like The New York Times and The Washington Post. But it has been difficult to quell the concerns of lawmakers, and Ms. Sandberg\u2019s meetings this week were focused on fixing various problems facing the company.Ms. Sandberg, 48, knows her way in Washington, having worked here for years as a top aide in the Treasury Department. She is now regularly mentioned as a potential political candidate. That speculation increased in 2013 after the release of her first book, \u201cLean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.\u201d She was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and is a top Democratic donor.She has tried to deflect rumors about running for office, but they persist, and her appearance in Washington this week is unlikely to quell them. At her only public event in Washington, she gave smooth and measured answers to questions from Mike Allen, a co-founder of Axios, the online news start-up that hosted the event. The performance stood in stark contrast to efforts from Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, who usually appears far less comfortable in such situations \u2014 and who has also been mentioned as a potential political candidate.With House Intelligence Committee leaders who are investigating the company\u2019s role in foreign meddling in the election, Ms. Sandberg agreed to hand over a broader set of data linked to fake Russian accounts and to give more information about how that data was targeted to users. With top Republican and Democratic leaders of the House, she emphasized the company\u2019s desire to help with the investigation and promoted its plan to hire thousands of people to review ad purchases so the mistakes of the 2016 election are prevented from happening again.\u201cThey are leaning in on this issue,\u201d said Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation, alluding to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s book.\u201cThey have launched a platform that communicates around the world,\u201d Mr. Conaway said, \u201cand it\u2019s important for us to understand their perspective.\u201dIn a one-hour meeting Thursday with at least 17 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Ms. Sandberg delivered the same message and a peace offering.Ms. Sandberg responded with personal reflections. She said she was disappointed that Facebook ads had been used to sow racial division during the election, according to the caucus chairman, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, a Democrat from Louisiana. She told the caucus that she prayed daily that Facebook hadn\u2019t contributed to the outcome of the election, according to Representative G. K. Butterfield, a Democrat from North Carolina. And she promised that Facebook would appoint an African-American member to its board in the near future.\u201cI remain cautiously optimistic,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said after the meeting.When asked to comment on her day, Ms. Sandberg waved her hands and said: \u201cSorry, we\u2019re not talking. I need time for myself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ryan delivered on Thursday a spirited keynote address at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York.The 17-minute roast included jokes about his home state of Wisconsin, the news media, Hillary Clinton\u2019s election loss, Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and more. But he aimed his edgiest zingers at President Trump. ______PATRICIA HEATON, host: Please welcome Representative Paul Ryan.(Applause)PAUL D. RYAN, House speaker: Enough with the applause, alright? You sound like the cabinet when Donald Trump walks in the room.Just wanted to get right off to it, right?You know what I find amazing about this is I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen this many New York liberals, this many Wall Street C.E.O.s, in one room, since my last visit to the White House.First off, I just want to say good evening. Cardinal Dolan, your Eminence, he and I go back a long way. He was our bishop in Milwaukee, so we have a great, great past. And we in Wisconsin, like you, adore Cardinal Timothy Dolan.Gov. Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, Pete King, my buddy. And Chuck and Kirsten couldn\u2019t join us tonight because they are literally busy voting right now, they will have a budget vote. It should have happened 9 minutes ago, so knowing the Senate, it hasn\u2019t happened yet.I want to thank Patricia Heaton. Patricia and I do go back a long ways. Because you know what, Patricia Heaton, she is a Hollywood Republican. A Hollywood Republican. That is an oxymoron. Which clearly was the word that Rex Tillerson was searching for.I just want to say, you all look great, everyone looks just great tonight. We feel right at home. Because this is exactly what our dinner parties in Janesville, Wisconsin look like.You know this is really our favorite time of the year, just love it, October. We\u2019ve got deer season, the leaves are changing. The beaches are empty, or as Chris Christie calls them, perfect.I want to promise you though, as I\u2019ve heard a few stories about how the dinner went last year. So I want to put your minds at ease, you can relax about my remarks. I know last year that Donald Trump offended some people. I know his comments, according to critics, went too far. Some said it was unbecoming of a public figure, and they said that his comments were offensive. Well, thank God he\u2019s learned his lesson.A lot of people, they ask me, you know, a guy from Wisconsin, what\u2019s it like to work with an abrasive New Yorker with a loud mouth? But you know, once you get to know him, Chuck Schumer\u2019s not all that bad.I know why he\u2019s been so hard on the president, actually\u2014 it has nothing to do with ideology. You see, Chuck\u2019s mad that he lost his top donor.Chuck is 66 years old, which makes him part of the Democratic leadership youth movement.Now he\u2019s not even here, so I feel like I need to apologize, probably, for that last joke. At one point, I did want to repeal and replace it, but I couldn\u2019t get that to the Senate.So, when you take a look at where we are this year, just think about it for a second. Think about all that has happened since the last Al Smith dinner. It\u2019s been almost a year ago that on November the 8th, countless shocked Americans broke into tears over the election results. But enough about the press.The truth is the press absolutely misunderstands and never records the big accomplishments of the White House. Look at all the new jobs that the President has created. Just among the White House staff!And when you read the papers tomorrow, everyone\u2019s going to report this thing differently. Breitbart is going to lead with, \u201cRyan slams the president amongst liberal elites.\u201d New York Times is going to report \u201cRyan defends the president in a state Hillary won.\u201d And the president will tweet, \u201c300,000 at Al Smith Dinner cheer mention of my name.\u201dYou are probably looking at this side and thinking I\u2019ve seen that guy on TV before, I kind of know who he is, but a lot of you don\u2019t know me. So let me just give some basic background facts. Let\u2019s call it, my top 10 facts. And they all must be true because you can find them on the internet.Fact #1. Like you\u2019ve heard, I\u2019m from Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a fantastic place to visit in the fall. Looking back, someone should have probably told Hillary Clinton that fact. Just saying.You know, speaking of which, actually, I got a copy of her new book. This thing sums up politics perfectly. She took 8 months, writing 10 hours a day, to explain what happened in 512 pages. The president explained it in a tweet, #I won.Fact #2. You know, we have primaries in the Republic Party these days. My primary opponent in 2016 was endorsed by Sarah Palin. And I\u2019m really not that mad about it, because Sarah and I actually have a lot in common. We both lost for Vice President, we both debated Joe Biden. And given the current investigations, I, too, can see Russia from the House.By the way, I do really appreciate these laughs. I usually don\u2019t get laughs like this except when I am actually debating Joe Biden.Fact #3. All the experts, the pollsters, they all say that my popularity is going down because of my relationship with Donald Trump. Some disapprove of the way I defend the President. Others say I don\u2019t defend him enough. Fortunately, the media understands all of this, and they choose to ask me only questions on policy and issues.Fact #4. It\u2019s true, I once drove the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile, which basically meant that people were constantly laughing at me. It was perfect preparation for being in Congress.You know what we call the Weinermobile in Wisconsin? A chick magnet. It is!Fact #5. I am proud member of this church. You know, the Catholic Church actually has a whole lot in common with Washington D.C. Either place, it takes about 7 years for someone to get confirmed.I really wish Chuck were here at this moment right now.The only basic difference between a Catholic Mass and a filibuster is that one ends with a sip of wine and the other ends with an entire bottle.Fact #6. As a practicing Catholic, I believe in miracles. In fact, I\u2019ve actually seen miracles.In 2015, I saw Joe Biden give a 2-minute speech. And in 2012, and there are 3 witnesses who saw this, I saw Mitt Romney with a hair out of place.I believe in miracles. Then again, I also believed in Brian Kelly when he became the head coach at Notre Dame.Last year, Notre Dame Football and Cardinal Tim Dolan, they had a lot in common. Both made thousands of people stand up and say, \u201cJesus Christ.\u201dFact #7. When people ask me if I believe everything I see on Facebook, I answer, \u201cNyet.\u201dHere\u2019s one that\u2019s kind of interesting, Fact #8. The fact that you learn when you are speaker. I\u2019m now second in line of succession since Steve Bannon has resigned.Fact #9. Every morning, I wake up in my office and I scroll Twitter to see which tweets that I\u2019ll have to pretend that I did not see later on.Fact #10. Every afternoon, former speaker John Boehner calls me up. Not to give advice. Just to laugh.Actually, it was John Boehner who was the one who tried to convince me to take this job as Speaker. In fact, and this is a true story, like all of the other one\u2019s I\u2019ve told, he even got Cardinal Dolan to call me to encourage me to take this job. God may forgive you, Cardinal, but I will not.Talk about pulling the ultimate Catholic guilt card.You may remember this, it got a lot of press at the time, but John retired after he got the Pope to take an official visit and address Congress. It was special moment for all of us as Catholics in Congress, but it was a really special moment for John Boehner. We all know how emotional he gets, and he decided right then and there to hang it up.So, Cardinal Dolan, my friend, Tim, I need you to hurry up and become the Pope so that I can invite you to Congress and I can get the hell outta there.Actually, we have some other things in common. In November a few years ago Cardinal Dolan himself ran for office in the 2007 United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, but he lost for vice president. So Cardinal, join the club.It was last January, January 20th, that Cardinal Dolan gave the benediction at President Trump\u2019s inaugural. He recited a prayer from the Book of Wisdom. It\u2019s a book that no one in Washington is familiar with.Actually, there was just this one kind of awkward moment\u2014when the Cardinal talked about the infallible, almighty Supreme Being, the President stood up and took a bow. Both Presidents actually.The truth is, no one is infallible, we all make mistakes, we all learn. I personally have learned so much in Congress. For example, I learned that tweeting after midnight is a really bad idea, whether you\u2019re President Trump or especially Anthony Weiner. Or Ted Cruz for that matter.You know, at one point, the President actually insulted me. I know that sounds kind of surprising. He described me as a Boy Scout who is boring to talk to. It didn\u2019t hurt my feelings. What hurt my feelings was when my wife agreed with him.I got to tell you, I really have learned so much. I learned that in Catholicism, you\u2019re guilty until proven less guilty.I learned that God is always listening\u2026as is Vladimir Putin.I learned how D.C. works. I play the good cop. Mitch McConnell plays the bad cop. And Bob Mueller plays the really bad cop.I learned how to handle insults. Steve Bannon said that I was born in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation. This is amazing\u2014no one knew Steve believed in science!And most important thing I\u2019ve learned of all, I am learning that becoming Speaker of the House is a steppingstone...to becoming ex-Speaker of the House.Just because I am speaker you did not have to invite me and I am so honored you did.And that is because this is really a magnificent event. People, Republicans and Democrats, citizens and Catholics, have watched this dinner on TV for years. We need an event like this more now than ever.It is an opportunity for us to come together in support of a truly righteous mission\u2014to bring hope to the neediest children in the Archdiocese of New York.You know, earlier today, Cardinal Dolan brought me over to The Foundling, where they are just doing incredible work to help underserved families rebuild their lives, to reclaim a greater sense of dignity and hope.We can achieve so much, and we can achieve so much when we tackle poverty eye to eye, soul to soul, person to person. As Catholics, we call this solidarity and subsidiarity.We are not yet through the worst hurricane season, so we need to be thinking about other citizens who live beyond these boroughs.It\u2019s the worst hurricane season in recent memory. An inferno has blackened the homes and hillsides across Northern California. Dozens of people are still hospitalized after the massacre in Las Vegas.So much has been taken.I think back a few weeks ago, I went down to Houston, and I was on my way to a shelter. The sun was barely up, it was the crack of dawn, and it was already as humid as can be. And you could almost feel the exhaustion in the air.But we get there, and I got to tell you, this shelter was alive. It was full of life, and hope, and prayer. Thirty-eight counties in Texas, people just out of their homes. And were volunteers from seemingly everywhere, people from the South, people from the Midwest, people from the Northeast.People were telling me how they just felt they had to be there, that they didn\u2019t care how long it took. They would stay and do whatever was needed. They just got up and came. It was truly something.So yes, much has been taken, but not our spirit. Not our nation\u2019s resilience. Not our faith.So in these moments when people are suddenly isolated and separated from everything they know, it is those unspoken bonds between us, it is that common humanity, which brings us together and lifts us up.A lot of people are hurting tonight. Please keep them in your prayers. May they, in the fullness of time, find comfort and renewal.Thank you for having me. God bless you and your families, this archdiocese. And God bless the United States of America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U., Citing Amazon and Apple, Tells Nations to Collect Tax", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European competition regulators on Wednesday mounted a push against tax avoidance by Silicon Valley giants, announcing plans to take Ireland to court for failing to collect back taxes from Apple and ordering Luxembourg to claim unpaid taxes from Amazon.Officials in Europe have been particularly focused on flexing their regulatory muscles against American technology companies, including assessing penalties for antitrust violations and opening investigations into the mishandling of customer data.Critics have argued that the measures show that the European Union is unfairly targeting such companies \u2014 an accusation that officials in Europe deny.The moves to address tax avoidance have special resonance in the region, much of which has endured painful austerity measures stemming from the financial crisis. Opponents of those measures complain that big companies have skirted their tax obligations, leaving small firms and individuals to make up the difference.European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.A year later, \u201cIreland has not recovered any money, not even in part,\u201d she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid \u201cmore conflictual waters,\u201d a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.At the time of the ruling, Europe\u2019s competition watchdogs said that Apple\u2019s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\u201dThe Irish Department of Finance said that it \u201chas never accepted the commission\u2019s analysis\u201d in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager\u2019s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had \u201cmade significant progress on this complex issue\u201d and accused the European authorities of taking a \u201cwholly unnecessary step.\u201dApple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had \u201cno valid economic justification\u201d and that the company had been able to \u201cavoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.\u201dAmazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.\u201cWe believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it \u201cpaid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\u201dAmazon said it would study the commission\u2019s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to \u201cillegal state aid.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. \u201cThe main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.\u201dA broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.\u201cThere are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,\u201d Mr. Fuest said.The European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc\u2019s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries.Advertisement"}

But at some core human level, both are driven by fear of a future defined by outsiders, and a love for what is.I recognized the emotions I heard talking to bookstore owners and writers because it reminded me of the emotions I heard talking to working-class Americans as they struggled through the global financial crisis and its aftermath. In both cases, many of the people I talked to started with jabs of outrage only to end with sighs and worry.\u201cI wish I was more optimistic,\u201d said Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend Books in Brisbane.\u201cWhat concerns me the most about the growing influence of corporations like Amazon is their worldview,\u201d said Tim Winton, the author of \u201cCloudstreet\u201d and many other well-known novels. \u201cPeople who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce.\u201dThat pessimism and the demand for a society built to a more human scale and tied more closely to identity and agency crosses ideological and international borders.Whether populism is the right word for this is an open question, but whatever it is, it may be the \u201cism\u201d of our time \u2014 a messy mishmash of human urges seeking a middle ground after the Cold War battle between capitalism and communism.Maybe it\u2019s just a function of change, and a lot of it.If that assessment is accurate, the urge to pull inward and protect your own \u2014 regardless of your professed politics \u2014 starts to make more sense.Where do you think Australia will end up falling on the spectrum between nationalism and globalism?And on a more personal note, where do you draw the line between openness to the world, and protection for the local?And now here are my picks of the week, a preview of our public event in Sydney this week with Joe Kahn, The New York Times\u2019s managing editor, and a recommendation for another newsletter we enjoy.__________And I\u2019m happy to report that he\u2019ll be back soon for more arresting work from Australia, so stay tuned.____________Joseph Kahn, the managing editor of The Times, is here in Sydney this week, and you\u2019re all invited to try and catch him in person or on the air.He\u2019ll be on ABC radio this afternoon, Thursday, around 4 p.m.In between, he\u2019ll be doing a mix of public and private discussions... and perhaps a bit of surfing.______He suggests that part of the reason is the Australian media \u2014 \u201clarge, right-wing heavy, thin on talent,\u201d he writes \u2014 and because Australia still tends to \u201cseek endorsement, or at least attention\u201d from \u201cany outsider who can stomach 22 hours on a plane.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obesity Was Rising as Ghana Embraced Fast Food. Then Came KFC.", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "The growing popularity of fried chicken and pizza in parts of Africa underscores how fast food is changing habits and expanding waistlines.Supported byACCRA, Ghana \u2014 After finishing high school a decade ago, Daniel Awaitey enrolled in computer courses, dropped out to work in a hotel, then settled into a well-paying job in the booming oil sector here.He has an apartment, a car, a smartphone and a long-distance girlfriend he met on a dating website. So he had reasons and the means to celebrate his 27th birthday in late July. His boss and co-workers joined him for an evening of laughter and selfies, lingering over dinner at his favorite restaurant: KFC.Mr. Awaitey first learned about the fried chicken chain on Facebook. The \u201cfinger lickin\u2019 good\u201d slogan caught his attention and it has lived up to expectations. \u201cThe food is just \u2014\u2014\u201d he said, raising his fingertips to his mouth and smacking his lips. \u201cWhen you taste it you feel good.\u201dChief among the corporate players is KFC, and its parent company, YUM!, which have muscled northward from South Africa \u2014 where KFC has about 850 outlets and a powerful brand name \u2014 throughout sub-Saharan Africa: to Angola, Tanzania, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana and beyond. The company brings the flavors that have made it popular in the West, seasoned with an intangible: the symbolic association of fast food with rich nations.The causes of obesity are widely acknowledged as complex \u2014 involving changing lifestyles, genetics, and, in particular, consumption of processed foods high in salt, sugar and fat.KFC\u2019s presence in Ghana so far is relatively modest but rapidly growing, and it underscores the way fast food can shape palates, habits and waistlines.\u201cYou are what you eat,\u201d said Charles Agyemang, a Ghanaian who is now an associate professor at the University of Amsterdam, where he studies obesity and chronic disease. KFC alone, he said, is only one factor in the country\u2019s obesity epidemic, but it represents the embrace of western foods. In Ghana, he said, \u201ceating local foods in some places is frowned upon. People see the European type as civilized.\u201d\u201cThis is having a major impact on obesity and heart disease.\u201dKFC executives see a major opportunity here to be part of people\u2019s regular routines, a goal they are advancing through a creative marketing campaign and use of social media. When asked if it is unhealthy for people to eat fried chicken often, Kimberly Morgan, a KFC spokeswoman in Plano, Texas, said, \u201cAt KFC, we\u2019re proud of our world famous, freshly in-store prepared fried chicken and believe it can be enjoyed as a part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.\u201dCompany representatives said they take health seriously in the region, noting their sponsorship of a youth cricket league in South Africa. The company, they said, has worked to make their menu more diverse and healthier.\u201cThat\u2019s why we provide consumers choice,\u201d said Andrew Havinga, who runs the supply chain for KFC\u2019s Africa division. \u201cWe do believe in a healthy, balanced lifestyle.\u201dFor now, though, KFC customers in Ghana have fewer healthy options than in Western countries. Grilled chicken, salads and sides like green beans and corn, standard at KFC in the United States, aren\u2019t available here. Mr. Havinga said KFC hoped to offer Ghanaians more options eventually. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our journey,\u201d he said.KFC emphasizes its focus on food sanitation and cleanliness. Ghanaian customers interviewed spoke appreciatively of the tidy containers used for takeout and the hairnets worn by workers.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t go into a market unless we are comfortable that we can deliver the same food safety standards that we deliver around the world and people see that,\u201d Greg Creed, the chief executive of YUM!, said in an interview last year on CNN. \u201cThey actually trust us that it\u2019s so much safer to eat at a KFC in Ghana, than it is to eat obviously, you know, pretty much anywhere else.\u201dSome nutrition experts bristle at the implication.\u201cTo say it\u2019s the safest food is a bit like saying my hand grenade is the safest hand grenade,\u201d said Mike Gibney, an emeritus professor of food and health at University College Dublin. \u201cGhanaians would be better off eating less KFC. But that is the way of the world I\u2019m afraid.\u201dIn Ghana, a place that suffered severe food shortages as recently as the early 1980s, attempts at curbing obesity have butted up against long held societal views: girth can be a welcome sight here. To many, weight gain is an acceptable side effect of a shift from hunger to joyful consumption.\u201cPeople march their sons and daughters to buy KFC and buy pizza and they like to show them what we can afford,\u201d said Matilda Laar, who lectures about family and consumer sciences at the University of Ghana. KFC isn\u2019t just food, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s social status.\u201dMr. Awaitey, who celebrated his 27th birthday at a KFC, was raised eating local dishes like soup and banku, a mix of fermented corn and cassava dough. He has increasingly made KFC part of his routine. Some nights on his way home from work, he turns off a sewer-lined street \u2014 jammed with cars and crisscrossed by men hawking sunglasses and women selling doughnuts from baskets they carry on their heads \u2014 and steps into a world transformed: a tidy, air-conditioned KFC where Bruno Mars blares. He orders dinner with a Coke, sitting in a translucent red plastic chair at a white table beneath giant faux Polaroids of children blowing bubbles in a park and a couple strolling on a beach.\u201cWhen I grew up I did not have the benefits I\u2019m enjoying today,\u201d Mr. Awaitey said. \u201cThis didn\u2019t even exist.In late July, Ashok Mohinani, whose company owns all the KFC franchises in Ghana, dabbed away a smear on a plate-glass window in the dining room of a KFC on the outskirts of Accra as customers trickled in after the doors opened at 10 a.m. It was the newest KFC in the nation, the 13th so far, and Mr. Mohinani was eager to see how it would be received.In Accra, the country\u2019s densely populated capital, it was plain that diets were changing. Mr. Mohinani had watched street fare evolve from stews and porridges to fried rice and knockoff Cheetos. Vendors now stocked glass cabinets with fried chicken, which in the past families served only on holidays.The first fast food restaurants to move in were local chains that served fried chicken and mimicked Western brands. Mr. Mohinani was convinced a foreign chain would succeed.\u201cThe obvious brand,\u201d he said, \u201cwas KFC.\u201dKFC had established a beachhead in South Africa, opening there in the early 1970s. It is now so popular that its executives say they impress dinner-party guests by name-dropping the company where they work.In 2012, Mr. Mohinani opened a KFC franchise that included the first drive-through restaurant in the nation. People streamed in on foot, just to check it out.\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d he said.Now, he said, the goal is to move KFC from a special treat to routine. Toward that end, he has opened restaurants alongside gas stations. \u201cWe want this to evolve into the idea of getting it to be a daily brand.\u201dIt is a goal pursued by fast food companies around the world. From 2011 to 2016, fast food sales grew 21.5 percent in the United States, according to Euromonitor, a market-research firm, while they swelled 30 percent worldwide. The industry has had remarkable success in finding new mouths to feed, with 254 percent growth in Argentina, 83 percent in Vietnam, 64 percent in Egypt.While McDonald\u2019s remains the emblem of fast food worldwide, YUM! is number two and grew 22.9 percent from 2011 to 2016, considerably faster than the burger giant\u2019s 12.2 percent growth, according to Euromonitor. YUM!, which includes Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, has nearly 44,000 restaurants worldwide, about 17,000 of them in emerging markets as of 2016, the company said. KFC and its franchisees operate nearly 21,000 KFC restaurants in 129 countries and territories around the globe.Crucial to its effort, the company said, is finding local franchisees like Mr. Mohinani, who have \u201cskin in the game\u201d as Mr. Creed, the YUM! chief executive, said on CNN. The company can rely on their knowledge of the local market and commitment to the investment.Also crucial: mixing local culture with flavors company executives repeatedly called \u201caspirational.\u201d In Ghana, KFC\u2019s menu includes chicken and fries along with a version of jollof rice, a locally beloved spicy dish made with peppers and onions.\u201cPeople come to us for the exotic, international American brand and we don\u2019t want to water that down,\u201d Mr. Mohinani said. \u201cIf we made the menu entirely local we\u2019d lose the aspiration.\u201dAffordability is another key ingredient. For KFC, costs here are hard to contain: the company imports chickens from Brazil, in part because local farms don\u2019t yet meet KFC\u2019s standards for safety and other issues; stores need generators in case of power outages; clean water is specially pumped in. Affordability got tougher since 2014 as global oil prices sank, straining the Ghanaian economy. Nevertheless, to lure more customers, Mr. Mohinani has cut menu prices \u2014 a risky move that he said has paid off with more repeat and regular visitors.KFC has also launched a marketing campaign called \u201cStreetwise\u201d \u2014 a series of ads and meals it had introduced in South Africa and elsewhere that are designed to appeal to a first generation of middle-class consumers looking for new experiences. In Ghana, the campaign aims at \u201chustlers and influencers,\u201d as executives called them, who rose from the streets and climbed the social ladder.New ads debuted in May for the Streetwise 2 \u2014 two pieces of chicken, fries and a Coke \u2014 with the popular local singer Ko-Jo Cue holding a sign that says, \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to the streets that I became a winner.\u201d\u201cI get a Streetwise 2,\u201d it continues, \u201cand fuel my ambition.\u201dThe health effects of fast food are challenging to study, particularly in the United States. That\u2019s because burgers, fries, fried chicken, pizzas and milkshakes get served all over the place, not just in traditional fast food joints, making it hard to establish the specific influence of fast food on obesity.Studies like these can be challenging to interpret, nutrition experts said, because people who eat fast food can have poor dietary habits, but this study sought to isolate fast food by factoring out many other issues, like sleep, exercise and even consumption of local fried foods. It also caught Singapore as its economy matured and fast food came to town.\u201cIt\u2019s a parable, or microcosm, of what\u2019s occurring in other parts of the globe,\u201d said Andrew Odegaard, a co-author on the study.In Ghana, data suggest the changing diet to heavier fare \u2014 including fast food but also processed foods \u2014 has led to soaring health risks.The death rate associated with high body mass index more than doubled in Ghana from roughly 14 per 100,000 in 1990 to 40 per 100,000, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation \u2014 and is fast approaching the global average of 54 deaths per 100,000.The data also suggest that the changing diet has led to health risks in Ghana that are getting worse at a rate faster than in the United States. From 1990 to 2015, deaths related to high body mass increased 179 percent in Ghana, compared to an increase of 20 percent in the United States.Further complicating the situation in Ghana, medication for high blood pressure is expensive and patients often ration it to save money. National health insurance lags in its coverage of other diet-related diseases such as diabetes; it doesn\u2019t cover devices to monitor blood sugar or some of the medicine to treat the side effects of diabetes.The nation\u2019s health system lacks a sufficient number of specialists, counselors and dietitians, let alone doctors.Dr. Laar, the lecturer from the University of Ghana, said the lack of proper care meant that some people would live with metabolic syndrome until they dropped.\u201cIt\u2019s common that you\u2019ll see someone just pass out and die,\u201d she said.One smoldering July day, mourners gathered in Accra to pay tribute to someone who did just that \u2014 Vivian Acheampong, 56, who had collapsed at home while hanging laundry on the clothesline and died two days later in a hospital. They fondly remembered her as they milled around and talked about what they believed had killed her. The doctors had told them one major factor was inattention to her high blood pressure: She hadn\u2019t listened to their professional advice to change her eating habits, and she couldn\u2019t afford all the medicine prescribed to control her condition. Relatives were convinced that her love for fried, fatty food had led her to become obese and played a role in her death.\u201cEvery time it was oil, oil, oil,\u201d said her son, Alfred Osei Tutu.Under a tent decorated with red and black bunting, her relatives and friends heaped their plates with the very foods they said they had warned her against: fried chicken, fried fish, fried rice and fried okra. These offerings have become common at funerals and represent a clear change in tradition: soup and vegetables were once served to mourners.Mrs. Acheampong\u2019s son said she had only dabbled in fast food and had never eaten at KFC. But she had developed a taste for such fare, usually cooked at home, after she moved from her native village to the capital 15 years ago for a better job. An old photo propped up at the funeral showed her as a slender young woman with hollowed cheeks. In the city, the family\u2019s diet shifted from stews and fufu, a starch made with cassava, to fried foods.\u201cYou have more money, you have more food,\u201d her son said matter-of-factly.KFC\u2019s busiest store in Ghana is its flagship, on Oxford Street in the Osu neighborhood. The nation\u2019s first KFC, it\u2019s a three-story, glassy corner building on a busy retail strip across from two banks and a jewelry shop.This summer, it drew from all walks: uniformed kids celebrating the last day of school; students from nearby universities using free Wi-Fi at corner tables; government workers ordering lunch to go; members of an artists\u2019 collective meeting over dinner to talk about a poetry slam; a dad treating his teenage son and friends to takeout chicken.On a weekend, the place turned raucous. A group of women dressed in tight, sparkly gowns guzzled champagne from the bottle one evening around a table littered with french fries, fried chicken and a birthday cake, taking turns smearing frosting across the face of the birthday girl. Children joined their parents, downing Coke and buckets of chicken.Fariha Yussif brought her boyfriend to the restaurant to celebrate his 24th birthday. They stood in a doorway and took photos as friends popped into the frame.\u201cI like the lights here,\u201d said Ms. Yussif, 21, pointing to the low-hanging red lamps. \u201cI like how they arrange the tables and chairs. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in Germany or Canada. Everything is very nice.\u201dIn late July, the restaurant was low on chicken, a two-day supply hiccup that dogged all of the country\u2019s KFCs. Some customers were outraged, prompting workers to ration supplies. Loretta Anaglate, 21, photographed the chicken in her boxed meal that was supposed to contain two pieces, but was actually only one and a half pieces.She wasn\u2019t holding a grudge. Ms. Anaglate, who has been eating KFC since her 16th birthday, lives in a university dormitory a 10-minute walk from a KFC. She estimates she eats there three times a week.\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d her friend, Loretta Adjei, interjected. \u201cShe eats here every day.\u201dThe two young women \u2014 who favor chicken, soda and a popular milkshake-like drink called Krushers \u2014 love the brand so much they worked for a day last year as \u201cpromo girls,\u201d handing out fliers for a new KFC.\u201cI don\u2019t see it as unhealthy,\u201d said Ms. Adjei, \u201cI\u2019m still fit and thin.\u201dLocal health experts said most Ghanaians don\u2019t pay attention to nutrition data. Indeed, the kind of public and political pressure that has prompted KFC to make other changes in the West has not been felt much here.The chickens are cooked in hot tubs of palm oil \u2014 a substance the company stopped using in the United States and Britain because, among other reasons, it is high in saturated fats. Customers in most of KFC\u2019s African markets must go online to find calorie counts, which are not on menu boards like in the United States. The company says there is neither government nor consumer clamor to add them.\u201cThe consumer mind-set is not asking that question generally,\u201d said Doug Smart, managing director of KFC Africa.Deep inside the presidential palace in Accra, called Flagstaff House, President Nana Akufo-Addo sat in his softly lit, spacious office, decorated with patterned marble floors and ornate, cream-colored couches. A wide-screen TV was tuned to local news. He has recently shed his sharp suits, favoring comfortable print shirts made in Ghana like the bright orange one with colorful swirls he wore on a recent evening.In office since January, the president ticked off his achievements: plans to chip away at the nation\u2019s debt load, to increase tax revenue, to cut waste, to beat back corruption and to spur the economy. He is in the midst of fulfilling a campaign promise to build a factory in each of the nation\u2019s 216 districts. He has begun cracking down on illegal gold mining, which is robbing the country of revenue from one of its key natural resources.Of course, he said, he\u2019s worried about skyrocketing obesity and related diseases. Like many of his countrymen, the round-faced president himself is overweight. He said he\u2019s also concerned about the increase in fast food restaurants that fuel the trends but said: \u201cI\u2019m strongly averse to banning things.\u201dPresident Akufo-Addo said he hoped to address the problem by expanding national health insurance. That, though, he said, is \u201ca work in progress,\u201d given the expense. So, for now, without specifics, he echoed leaders from other nations (and food companies themselves): \u201cThere must be heightened public awareness of what\u2019s good and bad in terms of eating habits.\u201dSome activists have tried to prompt more action. Dr. Laar has been pushing for food labels that display nutritional content and restrictions on imports of processed food.

Some credit unions and community banks also weighed in, lodging calls to lawmakers in their home states.What people are saying about the voteSome at the conference were floored that Mr. Kleinfeld had clearly landed on his feet with such large responsibility and oversight.

Shame on me.Am I an expert? Not at all. But it\u2019s a vastly different mental tug-of-war between the solver, setter and editor than the American-style crosswords I\u2019m used to, and it\u2019s a very pleasurable break for me. More important, as much as I would love to be an expert right this very minute, learning takes time, patience and practice, and I am loving the journey.Richard Silvestri is back with a cryptic crossword for us, and it\u2019s not one of the easier ones I\u2019ve solved. Not only do you have to know the \u201crecipe\u201d for a cryptic clue, but there is also some misdirection involved, which makes things tougher. For example, 1A\u2019s\u201cMay, for one, follows directions to get away (6)\u201dmight lead you to believe that Mr. Silvestri is talking about the month of May. I stared at this for a long time and finally had to admit to myself that this was not about the month of May. This is about New Jersey\u2019s Cape May, and if it follows directions (E for east and S for south), you getE + S + CAPE = ESCAPEThe definition, which always comes at either the beginning or the end of a cryptic clue, is \u201cget away.\u201d ESCAPE sounds right to me.I thought 9A had a really well-written clue because it sounds so much like a cohesive sentence without really revealing the hints within:\u201cLacking will, Republican exits major highway (9)\u201d\u201c ... Republican exits major highway.\u201dA major highway is an \u201cinterstate.\u201d If you take the Republican off the interstate by removing the letter \u201cR,\u201d you wind up with INTESTATE.One more, just because these are so much fun when you get that \u201cAha!\u201d moment. Another part of a cryptic crossword \u201crecipe\u201d is the indicator. The indicator tells the solver what to do with the wordplay part of the clue. At 17D, the clue is\u201cWedded mother disturbs trial (7)\u201dSince the wedded mother disturbs \u201ctrial,\u201d let\u2019s mix that word up. How do we know what to do with the letters? Well, the rest of the clue tells us that the definition has to be \u201cWedded,\u201d and the only word left is \u201cmother.\u201d MA is short for \u201cmother,\u201d so lets think of a synonym for \u201cWedded\u201d that starts with the letters \u201cMA\u201d and has the letters \u201cT,\u201d \u201cR,\u201d \u201cI,\u201d \u201cA\u201d and \u201cL\u201d in it.

{"Headline": "Five Common Wine Myths, Debunked", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourI was drawn to this dinner because, as with anyone who writes or talks about wine regularly, I am intimately familiar with all sorts of widely held yet mistaken notions. They are worth discussing, as these fallacies can be significant barriers to getting the most pleasure out of drinking wine.Sweet white wines ranging from barely sweet to luscious can be glorious with food. The key is balance: The residual sugar in the wine, often caused by incomplete fermentation, must be countered by lively acidity. In successful bottles, the result is a thrilling tightrope walk as the wine treads the line between sweet and dry. These wines are indisputably sweet, but the acidity cleans away any cloying sensation, leaving a dry, refreshing feeling after swallowing.This stacked the deck a bit. Traditionally, foie gras is served with unctuously sweet wines like Sauternes. Even so, many of the diners seemed unpersuaded.\u201cPeople are stuck on the fact that they don\u2019t like sweet wines,\u201d Mr. Johnnes said after the dinner. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that. We\u2019re such a sweet culture.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to see where this comes from. White wines are generally served cooler than reds, and in an era of refrigerators and ice, this has come to mean ice-cold. Reds, meanwhile, are to be served at \u201croom temperature,\u201d a term derived at a time when many rooms had thick stone walls, and the indoor temperature may have hovered around 60 degrees.Serving whites too cold seriously compromises good bottles, muffling nuances and complexities. Conversely, mediocre whites ought to be served ice-cold; the temperature masks any flaws.If you are knocking back the house pinot grigio at the corner bar, make sure the bottle comes directly from the refrigerator. For a fine white, though, take it out of the fridge a good half-hour before serving, and in restaurants, do not reflexively allow the bottle to be put on ice. Take its temperature first.Reds are a bit trickier, depending on the age and texture of the wine. Ideally, a bottle should be slightly cool to the touch. Modern room temperature can often leave a good red seeming flabby or fatiguing. A slight chill is bracing to the wine. Tannic wines served too cold can seem tough and unpleasant. If a bottle seems too warm, 15 minutes in the fridge \u2014 or, at a restaurant, 10 minutes in an ice bucket \u2014 can work wonders.But as people become more confident, they quickly find the exceptions. Northern Rh\u00f4ne syrahs are beautiful with chicken, as is pinot noir or cabernet franc with duck. Seafood is another matter, and certain meatier specimens like salmon, tuna or octopus go well with light reds like pinot noir.Mr. Fusco\u2019s underlying motive may have been to demonstrate that not all California reds are big and powerful. These were both delightfully fresh, the cabernet snappy and the merlot soft. They went well with the salmon, and though I might have preferred a pinot noir, the wines made their points.This was borne out in a course of squab with currants. Mr. Johnnes and Raj Vaidya of Daniel picked two C\u00f4te-R\u00f4ties, a Domaine Ogier from 2010, an excellent vintage, and a Domaine Jamet from 2011, not a bad vintage though not as good as 2010.Even accounting for the different styles of the producers, the 2011 was far more giving, offering a chorus of savory flavors, while the 2010 was tight and reticent. I\u2019m not sure how both of these wines will fare in another decade. At this tasting, one was a wine of pleasure, the other a wine of potential.What other myths could have been addressed? The issue of aging, ros\u00e9s included. The effect of oak barrels on wine. Vineyard practices and soil composition. As I said, the feast could have gone on for days.Advertisement"}

I found the story fascinating because the whole thing is so banal. You have this picture of foreign spies using James Bond-type technology to go after an enemy\u2019s political system. Nope, turns out they went about it exactly how you or I might do it \u2014 they found some videos online and posted them on Facebook.Here I should mention that some two dozen American federal agencies used Kaspersky\u2019s software, including some of the most critical agencies like the Department of Energy, which oversees our nuclear program. Kaspersky was so thoroughly \u201cowned\u201d by the Israelis, that nearly a year later when Kaspersky\u2019s researchers discovered the intrusion, its own researchers called the Israeli attack code \u201cthe best we have ever seen.\u201dAs it turns out, the Israelis were so deep inside Kaspersky\u2019s systems that they watched \u2014 in real time \u2014 as Russian spies used Kaspersky\u2019s systems effectively as a Google search box for American classified government programs. The Israelis caught Russian spies searching any computer that contained Kaspersky\u2019s software for the words \u201cTop Secret,\u201d in a sense abusing Kaspersky\u2019s deep access to the innards of more than 400 million people\u2019s machines to search for American government classified programs.In at least one case, the spies struck gold: They discovered a trove of highly classified National Security Agency programs on an agency employee\u2019s personal computer. Apparently the employee had installed the Kaspersky software on his home computer, not knowing that in doing so he was giving Russians full access to some of the N.S.A.\u2019s most coveted programs for penetrating foreign networks.Israel was able to capture all of this in real time and provided the N.S.A. with evidence in the forms of screenshots and other documentation, which is how the N.S.A. learned the source of this particular leak. The tip also prompted tons of internal discussions and studies within the United States intelligence community, which eventually led to a government ban on Kaspersky products last month.There are still some possible technical explanations for how Russia could have used Kaspersky as a backdoor without Kaspersky\u2019s knowledge. But most counterintelligence experts, including one we quoted from the Central Intelligence Agency, insist there is no way these kinds of broad scans for United States intelligence could have been conducted without Kaspersky\u2019s knowledge.And even if Kaspersky was not complicit, these experts say, that would still mean Kaspersky is either grossly incompetent or horrendously compromised. As a security company, neither is optimal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "High School Students Explain Why They Protest Anthems and Pledges", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byColin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to sit or take a knee during the national anthem exploded into a national conversation about race. Here, high school students tell us why they sit or kneel during the national anthem or the Pledge of Allegiance \u2014 or why they stand and participate. In August, 2016, the National Football League quarterback Colin Kaepernick began sitting, and then kneeling, during the national anthem before games as a protest against racist treatment of black people in the United States. His gestures created a new front in the national conversation about race, policing and patriotism. We asked high school students to tell us why they sit or kneel during the national anthem or Pledge of Allegiance, or why they stand and recite the words. Here is what they had to say. My first reaction to seeing Colin Kaepernick kneeling was: Why did he do this? And what does it mean to him? I Googled it, I looked on social media, I talked to my parents. One thing my mom said to me is that I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about this so much if it didn\u2019t mean a lot to me. It was bothering me that I was thinking about not kneeling because it\u2019s one of those things where I can\u2019t sit back and watch everything happen and not say something about it. There was a lot of hate that went around. Some of the football players received death threats and people saying it was disrespectful to kneel. It went around a lot more than we anticipated. So many other people were posting it. It was getting hundreds of thousands of likes, so a lot of people had a lot to say. The football players were scared. I was scared. We didn\u2019t expect it to get so big, and we didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I\u2019m happy with it. I\u2019m proud of myself for standing up for something I believe in, even if other people don\u2019t. The people who know why I did it, I want them to know they\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s a lot scarier to do something by yourself than when you have people doing it with you. I really choose to stand to show respect to everyone who is in service, who is on duty at the moment. They give so much and they get so little. The national anthem, the pledge, it\u2019s all showing respect to people doing their duty overseas in order for us to have the freedom to protest. My dad and my brother both served in the army, and I\u2019m trying to go into the Navy SEALs. People coming back from the war and facing personal issues, this probably makes them feel so low. I think the kids kneeling in high schools are following a trend. There are only a few who will actually dedicate their time to this subject. All the kids like to follow the trends. They probably don\u2019t really reason with what they\u2019re doing. They feel like it\u2019s cool to follow along. At our homecoming in October, one other person in my grade, a person in the grade above me, and I decided to kneel for the national anthem. That was the only time we had the anthem before the game. We all identify as black males. It was a bit interesting that we were the only ones who did it. The first time, there were eight of us. It\u2019s been that number consistently. We\u2019ve done it at three games. We wrote an email to the athletic director in our school on behalf of three of us who had interest. We weren\u2019t asking for permission since it\u2019s a constitutional right, but we wanted to keep everybody on the same page. I have no connection to religion whatsoever. The fact that they added the \u201cunder God\u201d part to the Pledge of Allegiance doesn\u2019t represent me, and it doesn\u2019t represent others who do not have religious affiliations. There are things you can do besides saying the pledge to show that you support this country even if it might not support you. My mom is a public-school teacher. For her, it\u2019s helping others get a public-school education. For me, it\u2019s standing up for the rights that the country has promised to protect \u2014 I went to the Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C. I think that while racism is erased from the laws, women have rights and the laws prohibit racial bigotry, that doesn\u2019t mean it is not abundant in society. You can still see very clear examples of this when you read the news. For example, if you look at the Las Vegas shooter, who was white, most of the headlines I see describe the shooter as the \u201cleast expected to do this,\u201d or \u201che was a humble man,\u201d or \u201che was a nice neighbor.\u201d But shooters of other races immediately get the label of what they are, these people are terrorists, these people are murderers. While this man, who caused one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history, is given a humane perspective.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a high school student who spoke about not standing for the Pledge of Allegiance. She is Emma Cowan, not Cowen.Advertisement"}

All displayed the kinds of performances that make investors happy: profit surges, big jumps in revenue \u2014 sometimes both.If revenue growth is a good indication of giving the public what it wants, customers appear to love what the biggest technology companies are offering, whether it\u2019s cheap online storage, clothing or a social network, and the party isn\u2019t slowing down.But to a different audience \u2014 regulators, competitors, academics \u2014 the continued show of strength by big technology companies is a further sign of the risks of their getting bigger, even if there does not appear to be much of an appetite to do anything about it in the United States.\u201cI do not see, to be honest, anything between Amazon and a trillion-dollar market valuation except D.C. and Brussels, and at this point it looks more likely that it\u2019s Brussels,\u201d Mr. Galloway said, referring to the headquarters of the European Union.Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company\u2019s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.Amazon\u2019s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.The most remarkable sign of Amazon\u2019s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.Next week, Google\u2019s top lawyer, along with general counsels from Facebook and Twitter, will testify in front of lawmakers investigating how Russia used social media and technology platforms in the United States to influence the 2016 election.But as Alphabet reported another blockbuster earnings result on the back of strong sales of search advertising, the inquiry and any potential fallout were not discussed.On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google\u2019s pending appearance before Congress.Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share \u2014 surpassing Wall Street\u2019s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue \u2014 up 24 percent \u2014 while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company\u2019s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company\u2019s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion \u2014 or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.But in the past several years, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.Microsoft executives credited much of the company\u2019s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft\u2019s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.While Microsoft\u2019s attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment \u2014 its foray into making smartphones was a bomb \u2014 its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.Advertisement"}

Some comments were edited for length and clarity.I beg our congressmen and women to put their selfishness aside and try to come to some sort of compromise to prevent the further proliferation of guns and future mass murders.We arrived at my home, unpacked all the gear and began the arduous task of cleaning the hardware. Body count still zero. I put the hardware back in the safe, walking past my small children and my wife. Body count still zero. I do this every weekend, just like millions of Americans across this country.If you won\u2019t blame every Muslim for the vile acts of a handful of Muslims, why would you blame all lawful gun owners for the vile acts of a handful of lunatics?Such behavior was certainly considered rude, even caddish and the decent men I knew wouldn\u2019t do it.However, it was not then considered sexual harassment; it certainly was not regarded as anything that you could lose your job over, or be prosecuted over. It was widely regarded as a matter of internal restraint on the man\u2019s part and a matter of lack of internal restraint on the part of the occasional woman who would slap a man in the face.That said, that was then, this is now. And it\u2019s been \u201cnow\u201d for a couple decades. It\u2019s long past time for Harvey to have gotten with The Program. He certainly should know that the \u201960s and \u201970s aren\u2019t going to excuse anything now.That song was and still is mysterious and powerful. It stopped my soul from dying.We deserve respect, we deserve better. We are not begging for help, we want the help we deserve as fellow Americans.Now we live under constant police presence and the looming threat that these stormtroopers will be unleashed again on peacefully protesting citizenry. Some people and politicians (and monarchs) are really showing their true colors and it is really not pretty to look at. Now all we can do is wait and hope that cooler heads prevail.Catalan parties have been present in the parliament since its inception, have been willing part on governments from both sides of the aisle and have been an integral part on the stability of the country.Ignoring the laws that govern us all and even their local constitution, just crosses a line no state is willing to accept or the country would simply disappear in utter chaos. The King did his duty, and I am a republican at heart, but in moments like this I am behind defending the constitution that brought democracy, freedom and stability to my country for 40 years. I have no desire to see this peace broken.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Conservatives, With Bannon\u2019s Help, Look for Revenge in Mississippi", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe slogan \u201cRemember Mississippi\u201d has become shorthand around here for the unshakable belief among conservative activists that Senator Thad Cochran occupies a stolen seat.Now, from his law office in the pine belt of southern Mississippi, Mr. McDaniel is plotting his revenge. This time, he has a powerful new ally, Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, who is hoping to make Mississippi the next domino to fall in an insurgency that would remake the Senate \u2014 and the Republican Party.If Mr. McDaniel runs, as expected, he will face Senator Roger Wicker in a primary in June \u2014 the first election next year in which Republican Senate candidates would square off. The race could offer an early answer to a question that is vital to the party\u2019s future: Does the effort to replace sitting Republicans with populist conservatives in the mold of Mr. Trump have a credible chance of maturing into a national movement?Its backers are already plotting a course across the South and then westward to states like Nevada, Arizona, Nebraska, Wyoming and Utah. In all of those states, the insurgents have a rallying cry in Mr. Trump\u2019s name and a villain in the Washington\u2019s Republican leadership, especially in the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\u201cWe sensed the anger in \u201913 and \u201914,\u201d Mr. McDaniel said in an interview at his law practice in downtown Laurel. \u201cThat anger,\u201d he added, \u201creached its apex, it seemed, with Trump\u2019s election. But now that McConnell and his merry band of yes men like Wicker have stood in the way of Trump, that anger has escalated again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this type of environment,\u201d he concluded.\u201cAs much as Chris McDaniel may want it to be true, \u2018Washington, D.C.\u2019 will not be on the ballot for U.S. Senate in Mississippi next June,\u201d said Justin Brasell, Mr. Wicker\u2019s campaign manager.\u201cSenator Roger Wicker will be on the ballot,\u201d he added, \u201cthe same Roger Wicker who traveled the country in 2016 working to defeat Democrats and elect Donald Trump.\u201dOn policy, Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Wicker are not very far apart. They have both been supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s more controversial acts, like the travel ban on foreigners from predominantly Muslim countries. Both hold consistently conservative positions on gun rights and abortion. The biggest difference between the two is the matter of incumbency, which Mr. McDaniel hopes to turn into an unsurmountable liability for Mr. Wicker.But Mr. Trump may not end up being the most important person in the race whose name is not on the ballot. That could be Mr. McConnell, who has become the focal point for Republican grass-roots ire.\u201cIf Mitch McConnell sends a lot of money down here for Roger Wicker just like he did with Luther Strange, I think it will backfire,\u201d said Michael Bostic, a retired electrician and local Tea Party activist who said he believes Republicans have been giving lip service to campaign promises like repealing the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to believe Republicans most of my life. But when they blatantly lie to you, that just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201dMr. Bostic went to courthouses across the state to inspect voting records looking for evidence of fraud after Mr. McDaniel\u2019s 2014 loss, and he said he believed that Mr. McConnell and his allies in party leadership had rigged that election.\u201cPeople are mad,\u201d Mr. Bostic said.Laura Van Overschelde, a local Tea Party leader, put it this way: \u201cPeople are pretty hot under the collar. You can imagine the animus that still exists four years later.\u201dMr. McDaniel refused to concede the race and fought the outcome for months in court.If Mr. McDaniel runs, all of that bitterness is likely to return.Beyond Mississippi, Mr. Bannon sees races in other states that he believes he and his coalition of conservative donors and activists can reshape next year. And in those states, Mr. Bannon said, he sees two common elements that work to the advantage of insurgent challengers: rural, deeply conservative populations and small, inexpensive media markets.In Utah, he is plotting a challenge to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, another McConnell ally. Or if Mr. Hatch retires, as many expect, Mr. Bannon will take on the candidate that the party leadership endorses to replace him, which could be Mitt Romney.Mr. Bannon insists otherwise.\u201cThe biggest story is, Corker understands his career is over: six million in cash, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, which is by far the most prestigious in the Senate, and in Tennessee, which Trump won by 22 points,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got them on the run.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The gap between the central government and local governments is still quite large.\u201d\u201cClearly, there\u2019s been a willingness to let these guys flourish but, at the same time, a desire to neutralize them as an independent political force,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a founding partner of the Beijing-based research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.Analysts say the state intervention has resulted in entrepreneurs\u2019 losing confidence in China\u2019s future. Private-sector investment has been weak, and many tycoons have parked their money abroad should they run afoul of the government.Many others choose to simply lie low. \u201cThe savvy entrepreneurs have already worked out which way the wind is blowing,\u201d said Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun\u2019s chairman.Mo Shaoping, a prominent human rights lawyer who represents Guo Junwen, said many of his entrepreneur clients were insecure. Looming over them is the fear that the government might make them pay for their \u201coriginal sin\u201d \u2014 crimes including bribery and fraud related to actions they took before China more clearly codified what is legal and what is not.Mr. Mo is skeptical about the government\u2019s claim to protect entrepreneurs, citing the lack of enforcement of private property rights. \u201cIn reality, the implementation of it has been terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to wastepaper.\u201dMr. Guo was one of China\u2019s new generation of entrepreneurs. In 1990, he toured the United States and was struck by its trappings of middle-class comfort. After that trip, he set up a computer company.He set up a real estate company in 1993 and moved into hotel management four years later, owning four hotels across China. His company, Chongqing Xiya Industrial Group, employed more than 3,000 people.He also built ties to government officials, but he felt he could not bridge the deep mistrust.\u201cSome officials who encounter entrepreneurs avoid us like we are the god of plague,\u201d Mr. Guo said.His troubles began in 2008 after he sold a real estate project to a politically connected buyer in Kunming. That investor was angered at how poorly his business was doing and wanted to get back at Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Guo and his lawyers. Officials in Kunming did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Guo\u2019s account of the dispute could not be independently verified.In 2014, prosecutors in Kunming impounded the company\u2019s hotels and real estate projects. In 2015, a court convicted Mr. Guo for illegally occupying farmland and sentenced him to two years in prison, according to court documents. He lost an appeal but was released in January 2016 for time served.Zhang Dongshuo, Mr. Guo\u2019s other lawyer, said the asset seizure violated Chinese law because the court never convicted his client of fraud. Most of the assets have been returned to Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Guo said the authorities had not returned $450,000 in cash, six villas in Kunming and three apartments in Chongqing.A party member for more than three decades, before he went into business, Mr. Guo said he was encouraged by the government\u2019s talk about entrepreneur rights. He said he looked forward to the day the party would elevate businesspeople to be senior politicians, citing President Trump as an example.\u201cLook at Trump, a businessman who could even become president,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cFor us to be like America in recognizing the importance of entrepreneurs, I think we still need a little more time.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senators Demand Online Ad Disclosures as Tech Lobby Mobilizes", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain and two Democratic senators moved on Thursday to force Facebook, Google and other internet companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, after revelations that Russian-linked operatives bought deceptive ads in the run-up to the 2016 election with no disclosure required.But the tech industry, which has worked to thwart previous efforts to mandate such disclosure, is mobilizing an army of lobbyists and lawyers \u2014 including a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2014 to help shape proposed regulations. Long before the 2016 election, the adviser, Marc E. Elias, helped Facebook and Google request exemptions from the Federal Election Commission to existing disclosure rules, arguing that ads on the respective platforms were too small to fit disclaimers listing their sponsors.Now Mr. Elias\u2019s high-powered Democratic election law firm, Perkins Coie, is helping the companies navigate legal and regulatory issues arising from scrutiny of the Russian-linked ads, which critics say might have been flagged by the disclaimers. In a two-front war, tech companies are targeting an election commission rule-making process that was restarted last month and a legislative effort in the Senate.\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you they support this bill right now,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and the lead author of the proposed Honest Ads Act.But she and her co-author, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, urged the social media companies to take greater responsibility for the content that lands on their sites, including political ads and other content meant to sow discord or chaos. With Facebook and Google alone capturing an estimated 85 percent of all digital political ads, self-policing won\u2019t cut it, they said.\u201cThey have to realize the world has changed,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.Federal election law bars foreigners from spending money to try to influence United States elections.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served on the election commission from 2013 until this year. \u201cWe need to rethink all the exemptions for the internet because even if Facebook might not have known about the Russian advertising, they knew \u2014 and we all knew \u2014 that this was possible.\u201dThe new bill would require internet companies to provide information to the election commission about who is paying for online ads.The content and purchasers of the Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook and Google in 2016 \u201care a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Warner said.Yet government officials working on the investigations into the Russian-funded ads and the efforts to enact stricter disclosure requirements say Facebook and Google have been less than enthusiastic partners.And in the weeks leading up to the introduction of the Klobuchar-Warner-McCain bill, Facebook told congressional aides that it is too difficult to figure out if an ad is political or commercial because candidates are often changing messages and topics. The company added that with the sheer number of ads on the site, the engineering involved in identifying political ads would be extremely challenging.Around that time, both companies paid Perkins Coie to seek exemptions from the election commission to one of the few election rules that do apply to online political activity \u2014 that political ads placed on third-party websites contain disclaimers revealing who paid for them. The exemption requests, written by Mr. Elias, the head of Perkins Coie\u2019s political law practice, argued that it was impractical to require disclaimers on ads the size of those then being offered on Google and Facebook.Such disclaimers and other disclosure requirements might have helped deter the Russian-funded ads and other online efforts to meddle in the election, say advocates for stricter campaign finance rules. Mr. Elias went on to help lead research into Russian efforts to help Donald J. Trump and damage Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.It was \u201ckind of like the chickens coming home to roost,\u201d said Ms. Ravel, the former commissioner.She argued that since Facebook was not granted an exemption to the disclaimer requirements, it should have required advertisements to include disclaimers for the past half-dozen years. But referring to Mr. Elias, she said that \u201cthe savvy political insiders understand that there is not going to be any enforcement from the F.E.C.\u201d because the commission has frequently deadlocked along partisan lines over enforcement matters in recent years.Mr. Elias rejected suggestions that he helped Russia hurt Mrs. Clinton.\u201cRussia found a number of ways to aid Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, and the F.E.C. disclaimers would not have stopped them,\u201d he said. The ads in question would not have required the disclaimers, he said, because \u2014 according to Facebook \u2014 they did not explicitly mention Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton or the election. In a blog post, Facebook wrote that the ads focused on amplifying \u201cdivisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201dCiting United States intelligence findings that Russia was behind the hacking and dissemination of damaging emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Mr. Elias said, \u201cThe Russians were willing to break the law to help Donald Trump. I doubt the F.E.C. disclaimers were going to be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201dCritics are not accepting that. Google and Facebook had ample opportunity to work with the Federal Election Commission to devise and put in place effective and practical disclaimer rules, \u201cbut they were silent,\u201d said Lawrence M. Noble, a former general counsel for the election commission who now serves in that position with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that pushes for stricter rules governing money in politics.\u201cAnd they are still trying to avoid regulation,\u201d Mr. Noble said.A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.And the company\u2019s vice president for United States public policy, Erin Egan, said, \u201cWe look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution\u201d to \u201cachieve transparency in political advertising.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yes, I Really Am in This Beauty Pageant", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMy parents raised me to believe I could do and be anything. They say they don\u2019t regret it. I grew up alongside four brothers, watching movies where the hilarious lovable underdog wins in the end.This is how I wound up onstage competing in the Miss New York USA pageant. Also, I like costumes. Not only, or even especially, at Halloween. I wore them every day. As a kid, I dressed like a tomboy, wanting to be treated tough like my brothers. In my teens, I wore what girls wore to fit in, because I was told I could pull it off if I \u201ctried.\u201d I was trying to find a costume that got me closer to being comfortable in my own skin \u2014 the right costume to fit in. But sometimes the wrong costume is the key to feeling like myself.Two years ago, I found a ruffled blue 1970s prom dress at the Salvation Army. It had a huge yellowish stain on the front from sources unknown. My mom begged me not to touch it. I bought it for $5. That is the dress I wore in the pageant. The back was filled with patches I\u2019d made for my sponsors \u2014 the people and organizations who helped supply the nearly $1,500 I needed to compete, like Nascar.I am not a pageant person. But I saw a Facebook ad about being considered for the competition. All I had to do was put in my name and age, and send a photo of myself. It was as easy as setting up Tinder. I was contacted the next day for a phone interview. I told the pageant consultant that I was a graduate student and a stand-up comedian living in New York. She said that I was the \u201cmost diverse\u201d candidate who had ever applied. As a white brunette who dyes her hair blond, I was highly skeptical, but honored to be the most diverse.The ostensible purpose of the pageant is to win scholarship money, but the details of the scholarship were vague. When I asked the other contestants why they were competing, not one of them said for the chance to win a scholarship. Most saw the pageant as a low-level modeling opportunity. Two competitors, a doctor and a plus-size woman, told me they wanted to fight stereotypes. This almost seemed admirable at the time, but looking back I\u2019ve realized that they were, by participating in a beauty contest, actually reinforcing the notion that a woman\u2019s value is tied to her appearance.As an underdog in a beauty pageant with no talent portion, I knew I would have to work hard to stand out. Each contestant prepares in her own way. Some get pageant coaches. One contestant told me she had given up sugar, carbs and alcohol for six months \u2014 a saint. My plan was to try to gain weight. I put on only about seven pounds, but I think it really showed.A month before the pageant, an orientation was held at a hotel in upstate New York. High heels, full makeup, cocktail dresses and pageant moms filled the hotel ballroom.In the dressing room before the first day of competition, several contestants also didn\u2019t realize I was in the pageant. I confronted the most makeup I\u2019ve ever seen in one place, and I\u2019ve been to a Sephora. I must have been doing a great job setting myself apart: Before lunch, I had been asked by five girls whether I worked at the hotel.We were asked to dress in an outfit we would wear for a job interview. Most of the contestants wore skintight cocktail dresses. I wore my favorite red sequined jacket, which I bought at a yard sale for $3. I looked great. Just before I went in, I asked the monitor jokingly, \u201cHave any of the contestants cried yet?\u201d She replied, \u201cOf course.\u201dAt the end of the night, we gathered to listen to inspirational speeches and general warnings given by the pageant staff and previous contestants. Here are some of the things that were said:\u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to use butt glue, don\u2019t use it. Last year we had to peel a girl off of the furniture.\u201d\u201cIf you have \u2018something\u2019 out there on the internet and you think you might win, come down with the stomach flu now.\u201dDuring the swimsuit portion, most of the contestants wore sparkly bikinis paired with high heels, the way everyone swims. I wore a purple Nike one-piece paired with Chaco sandals that were made for hiking.Standing in my one-piece made for competitive swimming, being compared with models, I\u2019ve never felt more confident. That was because, while I was adhering to my long tradition of wearing costumes, mine reflected exactly who I was: the lovable underdog who wins in the end. Or at least hopes to.The next morning, we were given feedback to help us prepare for the last day of the pageant: \u201cLadies, you have to wear underwear. Two of the male judges said they felt like gynecologists.\u201d I took that piece of advice to heart.I did not come close to winning. But I did receive a wonderful message from a pageant staff member, who told me he believed in my career and thought one day I\u2019d get my break on late-night TV. \u201cPlease wear underwear on those shows too,\u201d he said.Kelsey Caine is a comedian.Advertisement"}

But the Republican proposal may not give them that reassurance.The ability to pay for the tax cuts matters because of Senate rules requiring legislation that adds to the federal deficit after a decade to expire. If Republicans can\u2019t show that a long-term tax cut will be deficit-neutral, they will have to scale back the size of the corporate tax cuts, make them temporary or find another way to pay for them.The prominent economic pessimist David Stockman, a director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration, said Wall Street was \u201cdelusional\u201d if it believed the plan would pass.\u201cThis is a fiscal disaster that when they [Wall Street] begin to look at it, they\u2019ll see it\u2019s not even remotely paid for.

{"Headline": "Couples Are Forced Into Plan B After Fires and Hurricanes", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElla McCallion woke up at 2 a.m. on Monday, Oct. 10 when she smelled smoke.Ms. McCallion and her then-fianc\u00e9, Jasper Smith, both 27 and from Portland, Ore., were staying at a friend\u2019s property in Sonoma, Calif., where they were planning to host 100 of their friends and family that coming Saturday. After a day of preparations, they fell into a fitful sleep to the sound of loud, gusting winds. Until Ms. McCallion woke up. She quickly shook Mr. Smith awake and looked out the window: Due east, the hills were glowing orange.Ms. McCallion was witnessing the beginning of the record-breaking wildfires that have torn through California\u2019s wine country over the last week and a half. As of Monday, at least 5,700 buildings have been destroyed, and 41 people have died. And 40,000 people had been evacuated.Planning a destination wedding is stressful enough, but having your nuptials disrupted by a rare weather event, whether it be an earthquake, hurricane, flood or wildfires, can wreak havoc on the most well-laid plans \u2014 even for couples whose weddings are several weeks (or months) away.It wasn\u2019t.Knowing when to make the call to change, or cancel ceremonies, was just one of the tough decisions these couples and others have had to make over the last several weeks as unpredictable wildfires and hurricanes caused disruptions to their best-laid plans.Mr. Smith and Ms. McCallion were quick to praise their original venues and vendors, which have offered full refunds, nearly across the board. And they are keeping their troubles in perspective.\u201cPeople are losing their homes. We have 100 people who are traveling to celebrate us,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing so badly.\u201dPutting together a backup plan helped: Mr. Smith and Ms. McCallion showed off their favorite parts of San Francisco, while still capturing the dinner party spirit of their original wedding. The two had a family-only ceremony at San Francisco\u2019s City Hall on Friday, Oct. 13 (\u201cMarried on Friday the 13th, under a blood-red sun!\u201d Mr. Smith wryly noted), followed by oysters and champagne at Land\u2019s End, a city park with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Guests then gathered at their new reception hall \u2014 a private room at Hong Kong Lounge, a lauded dim sum restaurant and a favorite of the couple\u2019s when they lived in San Francisco. Mr. Smith, arm around his bride, toasted his guests: \u201cYou all made our Plan B feel like a Plan A.\u201d The couple and their guests then moved down the street to Trad\u2019r Sam, where the jukebox loudly played \u201cSway\u201d as the bride and groom held each other close.Suits were pressed, the cake topper packed and all was a go for Bill Siegfried\u2019s and his partner, Greg Stockbridge\u2019s, Aug. 26 destination wedding. The New York couple planned to board a Carnival cruise ship docked in Galveston, Tex., say their vows before about 90 guests, and surprise everyone with a flash mob dance to Styx\u2019s \u201cCome Sail Away With Me,\u201d before cutting the cake and setting sail with their closest family and friends to Cozumel, Belize and the Honduras. A rehearsal dinner in Mr. Siegfried\u2019s hometown Sugar Land was set for Friday.But an unexpected guest crashed their wedding: A Category 4 hurricane.As Hurricane Harvey swirled closer to the Texas coast at the end of August, Mr. Siegfried, a 40-year-old program director for Hearst, and his fianc\u00e9, a 43-year-old personal trainer and group fitness instructor for the Y.M.C.A., grew uneasy. From their Sugar Land hotel room the day before the wedding, they watched as airlines canceled flights and weather predictions grew dire. \u201cThat morning, Greg looked up from the news coverage and said, \u2018We need a Plan B\u2019,\u201d Mr. Siegfried said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to get upset \u2014 we just went into attack mode,\u201d Mr. Siegfried said. He worked on securing space for the wedding at a Brazilian restaurant they had considered for the rehearsal dinner, which had a large enough space to accommodate guests already in town. Mr. Stockbridge bought up the roses, gladiolas and any other pink or purple flower he could find at the grocery store, mobbed with people buying canned food and water. A friend hunted down a two-tiered wedding cake. And by five o\u2019clock, with Mr. Stockbridge\u2019s sister officiating, they were exchanging vows, toasting their marriage and dancing the flash mob before 49 guests, as the first gusts of wind and rain arrived.Extensive damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which devastated several islands in the Caribbean, has forced numerous brides and grooms to rethink their weddings that were scheduled into the winter months. Some resorts on the islands of Anguilla, St. Barth\u2019s, St. Maarten and St. Thomas will remain closed through December, maybe later, to complete repairs.Ms. Gregoli says she and her clients were glued to the Weather Channel as recent hurricanes passed over the Caribbean islands. A few brides with upcoming weddings called her in tears. \u201cWhen I saw the second storm, I just kept thinking, \u2018This can\u2019t be happening,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Gregoli said.Brittany Christian and her fianc\u00e9, Marcus Benedict, weren\u2019t sure if their Sept. 30 wedding would go on in the Turks and Caicos until the day before they were set to board a flight to the ceremony. When the Minneapolis couple booked their destination wedding at Beaches Turks & Caicos Resort Villages & Spa last year, they knew they set the date during hurricane season, but enticed by the promise of crystalline waters, a white sand beach and the low odds that a hurricane would hit the weekend of their wedding, they took a gamble. Hurricane Irma hit the island three weeks before the wedding. At first, the couple relied on the Beaches fan page for updates as they fielded \u201cnonstop\u201d calls from friends and family trying to figure out if the wedding would go on as planned. \u201cIt was like having a second full-time job,\u201d said Ms. Christian, 28, a premium sales manager for the Minnesota United Football Club.The couple relaxed when the resort announced that they would remain closed until Sept. 21, reopening just in time for their wedding. But a week later, Beaches amended the original statement, saying they would be closed through December 2017. Ms. Christian and Mr. Benedict began scrambling.The resort had already notified the couple that they could rebook at another Beaches property, and they\u2019d nearly settled on the Bahamas, even planning the time and place of the ceremony and picking the food all over again, when a second hurricane, Maria, picked up strength in the Caribbean, making that resort less of a sure thing, too. Plus, they wanted their wedding in Turks and Caicos. As luck would have it, an executive at the Shore Club, a luxury boutique resort in the Turks and Caicos, contacted them. He\u2019d heard their wedding was in limbo and offered to personally help them reschedule it at the luxury boutique resort, even discounting some rates. But after a few days of planning \u2014 the time and place of the ceremony, what they\u2019d serve at the wedding \u2014 it became clear the property was just too expensive.By then, it was Saturday, the wedding was a week away and the couple still didn\u2019t have a venue, or anything to tell guests. \u201cI threw up my hands and started bawling,\u201d Ms. Christian said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Is this a sign? Are we not supposed to get married?\u201dThat night, while she was working, Mr. Benedict, a director of distribution for Target, called every property in the Turks and Caicos, quickly learning that Seven Stars Resort was open and accepting guests. \u201cIt became Turks or bust,\u201d he said.They negotiated a block of rooms for guests, signing the final contract on Tuesday evening, and at 6 a.m. the next day, they boarded the flight to the island. \u201cIf we can get through this,\u201d Mr. Benedict said, \u201cwe can get through anything.\u201dWhen Sasha Garfield, 30, and her fianc\u00e9, Colin McDonald, 31, who live in Newport, R.I., scheduled their wedding on the remote island of Cuttyhunk, a 1.5-mile spit of land off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts, they never dreamed that the place where Ms. Garfield spent her placid summers growing up would end up in the path of a hurricane. But in September, Hurricane Jose, a Category 1 storm, pushed wind and rain bands offshore the week of their wedding. The remnants of the storm were powerful enough to cancel ferries to Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket.The situation proved perilous to Ms. Garfield, a consultant at the Education Advisory Board, a best practice research and technology firm in Washington, and Mr. McDonald, a vice president of Platinum Equity in New York, because everything for the wedding had to be shipped in by ferry \u2013 food, drinks, chairs, tables, cutlery, even a tent large enough to accommodate the 155 guests. Lucky for them, wind directions made it possible for most ferries to travel to Cuttyhunk, despite some big rollers, leaving passengers on the deck soaked; two ferries were canceled and those guests bunked up at local hotels on the mainland until the following morning.The faraway hurricane challenged them in other ways, too. On the morning of the wedding, they had to find a new place for the wedding tent, which may not have withstood the strong winds in its original spot; they set up a new location just few hours before the ceremony. While some brides stress about seating charts, Ms. Garfield says she was more worried about having enough food (and guests) arriving on ferries. Still, the wedding happened on time that Saturday with all 155 guests in attendance, the rain stopping and the sun emerging minutes before the ceremony.\u201cWe always knew having the wedding on Cuttyhunk introduced a lot of risk and variables,\u201d Ms. Garfield said, \u201cbut we also knew, no matter what, it would be worth it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steinem, Sandberg and Judd on How to End Sex Harassment", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen have been speaking out over the last few weeks about sexual harassment and assaults \u2014 passionately, eloquently and sometimes tearfully \u2014 and we men have been (for once!) rather silent.I started with Gloria Steinem, who emphasized that men can stand up to make clear that inflicting unwanted sexual attention on another person is just plain wrong.\u201cEvery time a man interrupts the culture of dominance \u2014 and treats both women and men as unique individuals who are valuable for our hearts and minds and actions, not for how we look or where we are in some hierarchy \u2014 we are closer to being linked, not ranked,\u201d Steinem told me. \u201cFathers have a big chance to do this just by listening to their daughters, and showing them that they\u2019re worth listening to. Co-workers can do this by not commenting on a woman\u2019s appearance when they wouldn\u2019t say the same of a man.\u201cThis is not rocket science,\u201d Steinem added. \u201cIt\u2019s empathy.\u201dSheryl Sandberg, C.O.O. of Facebook, told me that she flinches a bit at references to male \u201callies,\u201d because that can sound as if men are wading in as a favor to women. In fact, she noted, it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest that we erase harassment and discrimination \u2014 and a man\u2019s own team will perform better if he includes women who feel safe and respected.Sandberg also emphasized something I strongly believe: We need not just sensitivity training, but also accountability. That means firing not only the men who sexually harass but also the men and women who are complicit.\u201cPeople need to be afraid not just of doing these things, but also of not doing anything when someone around them does it,\u201d Sandberg said. \u201cIf you know something is happening and you fail to take action, whether you are a man or a woman \u2014 especially when you are in power \u2014 you are responsible, too.\u201dOne dismissal sends a stronger message throughout an organization than 10,000 hours of sensitivity training.Men have sometimes been prone to disbelieve victims\u2019 stories, and one of the most distasteful aspects of the Harvey Weinstein scandal was a rush to refocus blame by questioning why female victims didn\u2019t speak up earlier or go to the police. That tendency to victim-shame is precisely why survivors are reluctant to speak up \u2014 and let\u2019s remember that culpability lies with perpetrators, not victims.\u201cMen being willing to have dialogue with their families and friends, and to disrupt sexist remarks, jokes and behavior, is integral to change,\u201d she said. \u201cLearning to let women speak up, and being open and teachable, is crucial. Imagine if we could simply say, \u2018stop\u2019 and \u2018no,\u2019 and men stopped? These micro interpersonal interactions hold transformative power.\u201d\u201cMore women in all positions of power,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not as tokens.\u201dI\u2019m sure that some men reading this are rolling their eyes. On Twitter, one person responded to my denunciation of sexual harassment with a snide, \u201cDo you have a penis at all?\u201d Sigh. We men simply have to understand that there is nothing manly about sexual assault.I asked my wife, Sheryl WuDunn, what her advice was for men, and she was concise: \u201cPut peer pressure on each other to treat women better.\u201dHey, men, let\u2019s heed her advice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Power, Corruption and Murder Roil Little Guyana", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA man died in a village in eastern Guyana last year; that much is beyond dispute. Faiyaz Narinedatt, 26, a husband and father, was found dead by the side of a dusty road in the early morning of Nov. 1, 2016.That night he had gone to a party hosted by a childhood acquaintance who had immigrated to Queens and recently come into money: Marcus Brian Jainarine Bisram. Three weeks later, the Guyanese police charged Mr. Bisram of ordering five associates to murder Mr. Narinedatt after he rejected Mr. Bisram\u2019s sexual advances at the party.By then, he could not be questioned because he had already returned to New York on Nov. 2. It was not until July 4, at the behest of the Guyanese government, that Mr. Bisram was arrested by United States marshals at his Rockaways beach house and jailed at the Manhattan Detention Center.Last week, Judge Peggy Kuo of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York certified that Mr. Bisram should be extradited to Guyana.The year since Mr. Narinedatt died has unraveled into a saga of bribery, corruption and social-media-fueled attacks, stretching from No. 70 Village in the South American nation of Guyana to the Guyanese community in New York. It has bitterly divided diaspora leaders in Richmond Hill, Queens, pitting Hindu priests, civic associations and relatives against one another.Last weekend, thousands flooded the Richmond Hill streets to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. Some community members supporting Mr. Bisram purposely stayed away in protest of the parade, which was run by a vocal critic of Mr. Bisram. Although Mr. Bisram is Hindu and the victim was Muslim, religion never seemed to be the divisive issue. It is about money, the two sides say.\u201cIt has become something because of a person being rich and a person being poor,\u201d said Lisa Khan, 32, a cousin of Mr. Narinedatt who lives in Queens. \u201cEveryone used to get along perfectly fine before. Everyone used to be in the same crowd partying, having a religious function. Now, it\u2019s who has money and power and who don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIn Queens, you find a replica of the bribery and corruption from Guyana,\u201d said Aubrey Bonnett, a professor at the State University of New York at Westbury who has written about the West Indian diaspora. \u201cIt\u2019s a miniature part of the subculture.\u201dSince gaining independence from Britain in 1966, Guyana has been politically divided between two major ethnic groups, African and Indian. Mr. Bisram and his family are of Indian heritage; the current ruling party in Guyana is mostly made up of Afro-Guyanese leaders.More than 80,000 Guyanese, mostly Indo-Guyanese from the Berbice farming region, now live in the contiguous Queens neighborhoods of South Ozone Park, Richmond Hill and Jamaica, according to the city\u2019s Department of Planning.Mr. Narinedatt and Mr. Bisram went to the same school in Berbice. At an early age, Mr. Bisram\u2019s parents separated. He moved in with his grandmother, and his aunts also took care of him.\u201cWe were all poor,\u201d said Dawanti Pariag, one of Mr. Bisram\u2019s aunts, outside the extradition hearing last month. \u201cHe know what\u2019s hardship, because he didn\u2019t grow up with parents since he was 3 and 4.\u201dAt 16, after finishing high school in Guyana, he joined his father in Queens, she said.Mr. Bisram later went to the Allen School of Health and Sciences in Jamaica, Queens, for a nursing degree to be a home health aide, his lawyer said. He did not go to Hunter College, as was stated on the Marcus Brian Bisram Foundation website, which recently was deactivated.\u201cHe receives a salary, and as part of his salary, which is very generous, he has taken it upon himself to donate to causes he sees fit in Guyana,\u201d Mr. Gallucci said. \u201cHis benefactor, or his employer, agrees with his decisions where he donates the money.\u201dHis aunt, Ms. Pariag, said that she never asked him where his money came from, but considered her nephew to be \u201cblessed.\u201dMr. Bisram started his foundation in the spring of 2016, and he pledged to donate $1 million per year (the equivalent of $200 million Guyanese dollars) to organizations in his country.There, the Bisram Foundation has built orphanages and repaired the traffic office of a local police precinct; it donated to community policing groups, blood banks, a cricket team and laid-off sugar workers; it has given backpacks to poor students. Because of his wealth, Mr. Gallucci said, Mr. Bisram has \u201cdignitary status,\u201d and is given a security detail by the local police when in Guyana.The fateful party of last Oct. 31 coincided with Mr. Bisram\u2019s philanthropic mission to Guyana, and community police officers \u2014 to whom Mr. Bisram was donating \u2014 were among the guests. Mr. Narinedatt was living in No. 70 Village, awaiting immigration documents that would allow him to join his wife in New York. He was one of about 150 people at the party, according to Mr. Bisram\u2019s Guyanese lawyer. The entire village was invited.According to the police report, one witness, a 16-year-old cousin of Mr. Bisram, saw Mr. Narinedatt drinking rum along with other partygoers. When Mr. Narinedatt went to urinate in the backyard, the witness said, Mr. Bisram fondled his genitals. Mr. Narinedatt slapped him in the face five times. The witness, according to a police report, then heard Mr. Bisram issue the order to kill Mr. Narinedatt, using the local slang: \u201cYou all done he.\u201dGuyana police reports included two witnesses who saw five men beating Mr. Narinedatt; one witness saw the men throw Mr. Narinedatt into the trunk of a car. The victim was found on the side of the No. 70 Village Public Road after 4 a.m. on Nov. 1. At first, the police considered his death a result of a hit and run. But Mr. Narinedatt\u2019s relatives said they suspected that it was staged.By then, Mr. Bisram was in New York, his return flight \u201cpreplanned,\u201d according to his lawyer.Frustrated by the slow response from local authorities, Mr. Narinedatt\u2019s uncle Abdool Rizam Shafeek, said he went to officials in the capital of Georgetown two weeks later.\u201cYou had a lot of covering up here, in Berbice, a lot of covering up from the first set of police who handled the matter,\u201d Mr. Shafeek said in an interview in Guyana. \u201cAt one time they were claiming it was an accident, but when you look at the body, it wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201dMr. Narinedatt, according to the coroner\u2019s report provided to the Guyanese police, had multiple skull fractures, a fractured spine and arm, along with a ruptured spleen and liver and pulmonary contusions. He also had alcohol in his system.In the months after the party, and then after Guyana issued a warrant for his arrest, Mr. Bisram lived a very public life, giving winter coats to the needy, accepting humanitarian awards and socializing with friends at Queens restaurants and bars.On the afternoon of July 4, Mr. Bisram was preparing for a holiday party at his five-bedroom, three-story beach house in the Rockaways that he purchased in 2015. His aunt, Ms. Pariag, recalled that she was making Guyanese \u201ccookup rice,\u201d when U.S. marshals came to arrest him. \u2014 In a basement apartment in the Bronx, Pooja Pitam lives with her parents, her older brother and her 18-month-old daughter, Aasimah. They share one bedroom.Her husband, Faiyaz Narinedatt, worked as a carpenter and, as a Muslim, taught at the mosque next door to his house in No. 70 Village. In February 2016, Ms. Pitam arrived in New York with her parents and older brother; she was seven months pregnant. They were sponsored for green cards by her paternal grandfather. Mr. Narinedatt stayed behind in Guyana with their son, Afthab, 3.Ms. Pitam said that soon after her husband\u2019s death, members of Mr. Bisram\u2019s family had offered her husband\u2019s family bribes not to go to the police in Georgetown. The first sum, according to Ms. Pitam, was $50,000 ($10 million Guyanese). The next was $250,000 ($50 million Guyanese).\u201cI refused,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t actually bring Faiyaz back. He was an only child. That money can\u2019t comfort Faiyaz\u2019s family.\u201dThe lawyer for Mr. Bisram in Guyana, Sanjeev Datadin, said it was the opposite \u2014 that Mr. Narinedatt\u2019s family had asked for money from Mr. Bisram\u2019s family to stay quiet.\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Ms. Pitam said, shaking her head in response.It was not until the first extradition hearing at the end of September that the two sides finally saw one another inside the Brooklyn federal courthouse.Mr. Bisram\u2019s friends and family numbered more than 40. Most were wearing business attire accented by yellow, in a show of unity. They filled four rows in the courtroom. Some of the 16 attending in support of Mr. Narinedatt\u2019s side had nowhere but the jury box to sit. They wore white T-shirts proclaiming \u201cJustice for Faiyaz.\u201dOne supporter of Mr. Bisram testily confronted a Brooklyn Hindu priest who claimed to be on Mr. Bisram\u2019s side but also appeared to support his critic, Lakshmee Singh, a Queens television personality who had organized the local Diwali parade in which the priest was planning to appear.Ms. Pitam brought her daughter, who fussed while the lawyers presented their arguments.When he entered the courtroom, Mr. Bisram did not at all resemble the coiffed image he has maintained on social media. His hair was uncombed and his eyes were bloodshot, brightening only when his family and friends waved to him.She asked three panelists pointed questions on the Bisram case, including the role of his wealth in those who support him.\u201cWe have a strange community,\u201d a Guyanese-American educator, Chuck Mohan, said on the program. \u201cThat somehow, if you supposedly have money, you are put on a pedestal.\u201dMs. Singh also asked the panelists how the official police report of Mr. Bisram\u2019s unwanted sexual advances would affect the LGBT community in Queens. Mohamed Q. Amin, the founder of a prominent gay rights group, Caribbean Equality Project, said it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and potentially dangerous for Ms. Singh to speculate on Mr. Bisram\u2019s sexual orientation when the accused had never made a public statement about it.The ramifications of such rumors could be serious in Guyana, Mr. Amin said, since the country still has laws against sodomy that could be punishable by life in prison, even if they are rarely enforced.But Colleen Chattergoon, a board member of the Bisram Foundation, blamed Ms. Singh for igniting the controversy, saying she was the one who had taken advantage of Mr. Bisram, including when she stayed at his beach house for free. Ms. Singh said that she had been invited.Back in March, Mr. Bisram sued Ms. Singh (as well as one of Mr. Narinedatt\u2019s cousins) for defamation. He claimed some comments they made about his guilt on Facebook, and what Ms. Singh said on her television program, were false and malicious. The suit alleges that Ms. Singh \u201cspread rumors on social networks that the Plaintiff was a homosexual; that is not true.\u201d The case is pending.\u201cI wanted to go and tell the judge that this man is wanted for murder,\u201d Ms. Singh said. \u201cI\u2019m not intimidated by him or his money. I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u201dThe squabbles expanded to almost comical proportions over the summer. Weeks after Mr. Bisram\u2019s arrest at his beach house, a flyer titled \u201cPetition to Arrest Richmond Hill Crooks\u201d showed up in stores and as inserts in free newspapers. Peppered with Guyanese slang and photos, it accused local priests and businessmen of accepting money from Mr. Bisram. No one took credit.Soon after, a letter was sent anonymously to Guyanese-owned companies and Hindu temples about \u201cthe turmoil that is ensuing in the Indo-Caribbean (Guyanese) community in New York.\u201d It blamed Ms. Singh and asked leaders to sever all ties with her. \u201cOur community needs to heal,\u201d the letter wrote. It was signed, \u201cHindus Community.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our duty to show gratitude to those who donate generously to us,\u201d the priest of that temple, Tillack Seerattan, said in August.Mr. Bisram has not donated in 2017, Mr. Seerattan said, but the organization still honored him last April for his humanitarian efforts.\u201cYou will always find that in this community, no matter how much good you do, people will try to bring you down,\u201d Mr. Seerattan said. In Guyana, he added, there is a saying: \u201cWhen you do a lot, people have a lot to say. When you do nothing, nobody has anything to say.\u201dMr. Seerattan attended the extradition hearings, sitting with Mr. Bisram\u2019s supporters.He said other leaders support Mr. Bisram only for his money. \u201cThat\u2019s the main divide in the community: greed versus morals,\u201d Mr. Gossai added. \u201cRight versus wrong.\u201dRalph Tamesh, president of the Indo-Caribbean Federation in Richmond Hill, agreed. \u201cIt sends the wrong message \u2014 that we are a corrupted people,\u201d he said. His group was able to raise only $500 for Mr. Narinedatt\u2019s widow.Ultimately, neither money nor gossip in Little Guyana holds sway over proceedings in the homeland, where the case appeared to be breaking down last month. The key witness who heard Mr. Bisram give the order to kill Mr. Narinedatt recanted. But then a judge was suddenly dismissed from the case, and proceedings started anew.Mr. Bisram\u2019s aunt, Ms. Pariag, and his Guyanese lawyer, Mr. Datadin, said they feared that because of his political connections to the People\u2019s Progressive Party, Mr. Bisram is being targeted by Guyana\u2019s party in power now.Mr. Gallucci, Mr. Bisram\u2019s New York lawyer, suggested that were Mr. Bisram to be extradited, his life would be in danger. He told the State Department that he will file a petition contesting the Brooklyn judge\u2019s ruling, which could take another two months \u2014 or longer. By then, he said, a Guyanese court might even throw out the charges against Mr. Bisram for lack of evidence.Mr. Narinedatt\u2019s family believes Mr. Bisram is trying to buy his freedom. Mr. Bisram\u2019s family distrusts the Narinedatt family\u2019s motives.\u201cWe don\u2019t feel for them because they are lying,\u201d said an uncle, Anand Pariag, at the courthouse. \u201cThey are making the story up to get a payback.\u201dIt would seem that the two sides were irrevocably divided.And yet they were also related.\u201cI know them all,\u201d Kristendat Pitam, 53, the widow\u2019s father, said in the Brooklyn federal courthouse for the extradition hearing. He was leaning in the hallway after the proceedings, gesturing to the cluster 20 feet away. \u201cI grew up with them. They are my cousins.\u201dHe went over to Mr. Pariag, who was visibly surprised by the gesture, and shook hands. He went to another of Mr. Bisram\u2019s aunts and they exchanged pleasantries.\u201cThat\u2019s your family, that\u2019s what you do,\u201d Mr. Pitam said. \u201cI am supporting my family too.\u201dNeil Marks contributed reporting from Berbice, Guyana.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Malta in an Uproar Over Killing of an Investigative Journalist", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, 53, died on Monday when the car she was driving exploded. She had spent years exposing corruption and nepotism among the Maltese elite, and made many enemies.The killing was condemned by leaders of the European Union \u2014 which Malta joined in 2004 \u2014 and by the pope, who in a rare message expressing condolences about a private citizen asked the archbishop of Malta to \u201cconvey his condolences to her family,\u201d according to a statement that was released on Friday.The killing has put the Labour government, led by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, under the spotlight. This year, Ms. Caruana Galizia, using some of the leaked Panama Papers, accused Mr. Muscat\u2019s wife of using a secret shell company that received unexplained payments from the ruling family of Azerbaijan, an allegation Mr. Muscat denied.Mr. Muscat said in an interview that, because of the wide range of people who came under scrutiny from Ms. Caruana Galizia, \u201cit would be rushing to conclusions to just point a finger in one direction.\u201dHe acknowledged that \u201cit is a difficult case\u201d but added: \u201cI want to make sure as prime minister that our investigators have the necessary resources and know-how to get to the bottom of this.\u201dBut at a shambolic news conference on Thursday evening, Malta\u2019s police commissioner, Lawrence Cutajar, only deepened a sense among many Maltese that the country\u2019s police force had little chance of finding the culprit, despite being aided by investigators from the F.B.I. and the Netherlands.Six previous car bombings since last year, all of them involving people linked to criminal groups, have gone unsolved.Mr. Cutajar did not provide many answers; he reacted with irritation when a reporter pointed out that he, too, had been a target of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s reports.A flurry of online petitions initiated by supporters and foes of the government have alternately praised and denounced Mr. Muscat\u2019s handling of the case.The opposition leader, Adrian Delia, has seized on the murder to demand the resignation of the prime minister, the police commissioner and various officials appointed by Mr. Muscat. \u201cWe do not have faith in the police force,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt is not there to protect us but is a puppet of the political leadership.\u201d The murder, he said, was \u201c not a one-off fluke\u201d but a sign that the country\u2019s \u201cinstitutions are being dismantled.\u201dSimon Busuttil, the former leader of the opposition, said on Friday that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the police commissioner\u2019s fumbling and evasive performance. \u201cI thought I was watching a third world country,\u201d he said.The Malta Independent, a leading newspaper, also mocked the police commissioner, saying on Friday that his news conference had clarified only one thing: Mr. Cutajar \u201chas to go, now.\u201dMalta has had five police commissioners since the Labour Party came to power in 2013, a constant reshuffling of law enforcement leadership that Mr. Muscat, the prime minister who made the changes, said \u201cis not something I\u2019m proud of.\u201dMr. Muscat\u2019s political opponents accuse him of neutering the police force for political reasons so as to save his allies from serious investigations into allegations of secret offshore bank accounts, kickbacks, money laundering and other forms of corruption. Many of these allegations arose from the writings of Ms. Caruana Galizia.Under pressure from the European Union to ensure that her murder is properly investigated, Mr. Muscat said ahead of a summit meeting in Brussels that Malta would consider asking the police agency Europol to get involved and promised to \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to find out who killed the journalist.On Thursday, Mr. Galizia said his family had refused a request from the government to endorse a reward of one million euros for information leading to the conviction of his mother\u2019s killer. Instead, the family assailed \u201cthe people in government who stood to gain from our mother\u2019s murder\u201d and called for Mr. Muscat to step down.An article on Saturday about the outcry over the killing of an investigative journalist in Malta misspelled the surname of a former opposition leader. He is Simon Busuttil, not Busutti.Andrew Higgins reported from Valletta, and Liam Stack from Paris.Advertisement"}

Mr. Xi created and empowered the cyberspace administration, which has subsumed many of the overlapping agencies that once governed content in cyberspace.The administration is now seen as an institution as important as the defense ministry. Since last year, it has been led by Xu Lin, 54, a party technocrat and former propaganda official, who, like other influential officials who previously worked beside Mr. Xi in Shanghai, has soared through the ranks.\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that technology has advanced more quickly than the government\u2019s ability to control it,\u201d Ms. Sacks said. Russia\u2019s interference with Facebook, to cite only one example, was \u201cjustification for exactly what they are doing here.\u201dThe tech firms also face tight penalties if they fail to keep users in line. In September, the cybersecurity administration imposed fines on social media platforms owned wholly or in part by three of China\u2019s biggest internet companies \u2014 Tencent Holdings, the Alibaba Group and Baidu \u2014 for failing to stop the circulation of fabricated rumors, violence and pornography. (Companies can be fined up to $76,000 per offense, and have their business licenses canceled, if they cannot prevent the transmission of banned content.)Still, China\u2019s advantage could be double-edged. Chinese internet companies have struggled to expand abroad, which experts say stems in part from their dependence on their government.Moreover, not all of the new restrictions have been welcomed here. Some of the companies \u2014 and internet users \u2014 balked at tightened enforcement of rules requiring users of social media platforms to provide their real identities to the companies (although they may still use online pseudonyms). Weibo\u2019s announcement that it was seeking 1,000 recruits to become supervisors to report illegal content online \u2014 the definitions of which can be expansive \u2014 was met by derision on its own site.\u201cOnline and offline, Big Brother is watching,\u201d wrote one user, who used the handle mingxinjianxing.But when it comes to the controversy over Russia\u2019s intervention, there has been little discussion here. Among the few who are discussing it on Weibo, some expressed shock that the United States does not censor information shared on social media platforms.Mr. Zhao, the young volunteer on Weibo, is typical of those here who believe government control is justified.In a restaurant called Europa, Mr. Zhao \u2014 who declined to disclose details of where and how he works \u2014 described China\u2019s system not as \u201cBig Brother\u201d so much as a younger brother, which he is, protecting children, like those of his sister, from harmful material.\u201cEven though the internet is virtual, it is still part of society,\u201d he added. \u201cSo in any space I feel no one should create pornographic, illegal or violent posts.\u201dIn his new capacity, he scours Weibo in search of the lurid and illicit.

{"Headline": "Women Denounce Harassment in California\u2019s Capital", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The groundswell over sexual harassment that has rocked Hollywood moved into California\u2019s capital on Tuesday as more than 140 women \u2014 including legislators, senior legislative aides and lobbyists \u2014 came forward to denounce what they describe as pervasive sexual misconduct by powerful men in the nation\u2019s most influential legislature.Women complained of groping, lewd comments and suggestions of trading sexual favors for legislation while doing business in Sacramento. Their grievances, contained in a public letter and detailed in a series of interviews, mark the latest fallout from the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal.The women who drafted the letter say they were flooded with anguished responses from women who reported enduring, or witnessing, sexual harassment from male legislators, aides and lobbyists, after they began circulating their statement in recent days.The letter comes as the scandal involving Mr. Weinstein had set off a wave of investigations, recriminations and accusations across the nation, including in state capitals in Rhode Island and South Dakota. Women from all walks of life \u2014 from actresses to corporate leaders \u2014 have used social media to report instances of abuse, often marked #metoo.\u201cAs women leaders in politics, in a state that postures itself as a leader in justice and equality, you might assume our experience has been different,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIt has not. Each of us has endured, or witnessed or worked with women who have experienced some form of dehumanizing behavior by men in power in our workplaces.\u201d\u201cMen have groped and touched us without our consent, made inappropriate comments about our bodies and our abilities,\u201d the letter said, adding: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we speak out? Sometimes out of fear. Sometimes out of shame. Often these men hold our professional fates in their hands.\u201dThe California legislature has set the national agenda on a variety of issues, including the environment, immigration and taxes. Although the state has produced a number of powerful female politicians, about 80 percent of the legislature is male.\u201cMultiple people have grabbed my butt and grabbed my breasts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about senior lobbyists and lawmakers.\u201dMs. Garcia, and the other women who came forward, did not name the lobbyists or lawmakers involved in the encounters. The letter was first published in The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday morning.Pamela Lopez, a partner at a Sacramento lobbying firm, said that for years she has dealt with inappropriate suggestions from male officials, but the most disturbing episode came early last year, at a social gathering of lawmakers and lobbyists in a Sacramento bar.As Ms. Lopez walked into the restroom, she said, she felt a large body pressing behind her. When she turned around, she saw that a lawmaker had locked the door behind him, had undone his pants and asked her to touch his genitals.\u201cHe had exposed himself and begun masturbating,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I was thinking was what do I do, what do I do. And of course, I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018No, I am not going to touch you,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI was firm and clear but I did not want to make a scene and he continued to masturbate and he kind of moved toward me and said, \u2018Just put your hand on me.\u2019 I said no.\u201dKaren Skelton, a political strategist and lawyer in Sacramento who signed the letter, said she experienced harassment firsthand when she was hired by a Fortune 500 company six years ago to run a campaign on behalf of a major legislative initiative. Her job included dealing with an elected California official involved with the issue.\u201cThis guy did things to me like touch my leg under the table at lunch and brush back my hair over my shoulder and sending me texts at 1 in the morning asking where I was,\u201d she said, declining to name him. \u201cI felt creeped out. I\u2019m a big girl. I can deal with it. What if I had been 22, someone new to this, who needed to support their family?\u201dThere has been a long and notorious history of sexual misconduct in state houses and Congress going back over at least the past 50 years. Many state Capitols are famous for being old boys\u2019 clubs. Many, including the one in Sacramento, are in relatively isolated parts of the state, away from family, friends and onlookers, in a culture marked by late-night dinners and drinking.Christine Pelosi, a signer of the letter who is the leader of the California Democratic Women\u2019s Caucus, said that legislators \u201cact differently in Sacramento \u2014 which is almost fantasy camp \u2014 as opposed to how they act as home.\u201d.Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the California State Assembly, said he did not think the Assembly ethics committee, which handles charges of sexual misconduct, could launch an investigation based on the letter, because it did not mention any names of offenders. He said the Assembly had created a committee in August to establish new rules aimed at cracking down on sexual harassment or intimidation.\u201cThe letter shows that sexual harassment is as prevalent in the Capitol as it is anywhere else in society,\u201d Mr. Rendon said.Samantha Corbin, a lobbyist and former legislative aide who helped organize the drive, said many of the California women who signed the letter had overcome fears of retaliation, emboldened by the women who related their stories about Mr. Weinstein in stories published by The New York Times and The New Yorker.She said until now women had routinely engaged on quiet rescue missions to help women caught what she described as predatory situations while working in lawmakers\u2019 offices.\u201cWe give each other tips on how to avoid certain situation \u2013 who might exercise predatory behavior,\u201d she said.\u201cYou are talking about power brokers in the largest state in the country,\u201d she said.Ms. Pelosi, who is the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said it was difficult for many of the women to sign the letter. \u201cI understand the courage of these women \u2013 Republicans and Democrats \u2013 coming forward. It is very, very, very hard.\u201dKevin de Leon, the president of the state Senate, issued a statement saying he applauded \u201cthe courage of women working in and around the Capitol who are coming forward and making their voices known.\u201dMr. de Leon, who announced this week he was running for the Senate, did not say whether he was aware of these kinds of episodes and did not return a request for comment.Scott Wiener, a newly elected member of the state Senate, said he had been struck by the culture he had found since coming to Sacramento. \u201cThe kind of sexism and misogynism that is pervasive in our culture is definitely prevalent in Sacramento,\u201d Mr. Wiener said.New allegations of harassment have emerged in other states in recent days, too. Teresa Tanzi, a Democratic state representative in Rhode Island, said on Tuesday that a male lawmaker who outranked her once told her \u201cthat if I want to see my bills advance, there was one thing I could do to make that happen.\u201d\u201cIt was stated very matter of factly that if I would have sex with this person, it would increase the likelihood of my bills passing,\u201d Ms. Tanzi said in an interview, although she declined to name the lawmaker or specify when the comment was made.Jesse McKinley and Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Trump Aides Charged as Prosecutors Reveal New Campaign Ties With Russia", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, announced charges on Monday against three advisers to President Trump\u2019s campaign and laid out the most explicit evidence to date that his campaign was eager to coordinate with the Russian government to damage his rival, Hillary Clinton.Mr. Papadopoulos secretly pleaded guilty weeks ago to lying to the F.B.I. about those contacts and has been cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors for months.Monday\u2019s dramatic announcements capped months of speculation about which of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign advisers might be first to be charged by Mr. Mueller, and they seemed to be a sign that the special counsel\u2019s investigation is nowhere close to complete.\u201cThere\u2019s a large-scale, ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part,\u201d Aaron S.J. Zelinsky, a prosecutor on Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, said at Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s plea hearing this month. The transcript of the hearing was released on Monday.Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, was indicted on charges including conspiracy, money laundering and other charges. Mr. Manafort's business associate, Rick Gates, was also charged.The announcements rippled across Washington, affecting both political parties. The powerful Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta quit his lobbying firm Monday. The firm, the Podesta Group, was hired to do lobbying work on behalf of Ukraine, work that is at the heart of Mr. Manafort\u2019s indictment.President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman is charged with channeling large sums of money from offshore bank accounts to pay for goods, services and real estate in the United States.In a court appearance on Monday, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates pleaded not guilty and were placed under house arrest on multimillion-dollar bonds. Mr. Papadopoulos is awaiting sentencing.Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyer, Kevin Downing, called the money laundering charges \u201cridiculous\u201d and noted that in the past half-century, prosecutors have charged only a handful of people with flouting foreign lobbying rules. Such violations are normally handled as an administrative matter. Mr. Manafort\u2019s Ukraine lobbying \u201cended in 2014, two years before Mr. Manafort served in the Trump campaign,\u201d Mr. Downing said.Lawyers for Mr. Papadopoulos declined to comment.But as Mr. Trump typed out that message, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team was unsealing documents related to Mr. Papadopoulos that directly undermined the president\u2019s claim.Mr. Trump called Mr. Papadopoulos an \u201cexcellent guy\u201d when he announced his foreign policy team in March 2016.On Monday, however, White House officials described him as someone who played an insignificant role in the campaign.\u201cLook, this individual was a member of a volunteer advisory council that met one time over the course of a year,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cI\u2019m not here to speak on behalf of the thousands of people that may have volunteered on the campaign.\u201dGeorge Papadopoulos, an adviser to the Trump campaign, contacted campaign officials at least 11 times from March to June 2016 about a potential meeting.Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to others, including someone with ties to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a woman who he believed was a relative of Mr. Putin. Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly tried to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials, court records show.\u201cWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d the woman, who was not identified, told Mr. Papadopoulos in an email. She was not actually a relative of Mr. Putin, according to court documents.Campaign officials knew that Mr. Papadopoulos was developing contacts in Russia, court documents show.He repeatedly tried to arrange a formal meeting for Mr. Trump in Russia. Among those in the campaign who knew about the contacts was Sam Clovis, who helped supervise the foreign-policy team, according to a former campaign aide. Mr. Clovis could not be reached for comment.Ultimately, senior campaign officials said that Mr. Trump should not make the trip and leave it to \u201csomeone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,\u201d according to an email cited in court papers. No campaign official made a formal trip to Russia.As the F.B.I. scrutiny continued, Mr. Papadopoulos changed his phone number and deleted his Facebook account, which he had used to communicate with the Russians. The F.B.I. has obtained emails, text messages, and the transcript of chats on Facebook and Skype records as part of its investigation.F.B.I. agents quietly arrested Mr. Papadopoulos at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on July 27, a day after agents raided Mr. Manafort\u2019s Virginia home. The Justice Department disclosed on Monday that Mr. Manafort had withheld evidence from Mr. Mueller that was discovered during that raid.With the charges against Mr. Manafort, Mr. Mueller has taken a broad view of his mandate. He was tapped to investigate Russian election meddling, whether anyone around Mr. Trump was involved and other crimes that followed from that investigation. The charges against Mr. Manafort do not directly relate to Mr. Trump or the campaign. Mr. Manafort had been under investigation in New York and Virginia until Mr. Mueller was appointed and assumed control.But on Friday night, people close to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and lawyers involved in the investigation said they had received no indication that an indictment against them was imminent.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Nicholas Fandos from Washington.Advertisement"}

The middle word of the organization\u2019s name is an acronym for Witch Interrogations, Trials & Colonial Hangings.Mr. Griego said he learned of Connecticut\u2019s witch trials 20 years ago and was surprised that no one had sought to clear the names of the victims, who he said were treated unfairly \u201cby a judicial system made of men who felt divinely inspired.\u201dScant documentation of the trials remains, and Beth Caruso, a Windsor resident and a founder of CT Witch Memorial, said Ms. Young\u2019s name had been unknown until old diary entries mentioning her surfaced in the early 20th century.Walter Woodward, a Connecticut state historian who is an associate professor of history at the University of Connecticut, said the state\u2019s witch history has been overlooked.\u201cHistorians of New England have long treated events in Massachusetts as if they represented the entire history of New England,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has only begun to change significantly in recent years.\u201dProfessor Woodward believes that another reason for Salem\u2019s prominence is that its witch trials were much more condensed, spanning just 15 months, compared with the decades of less frequent trials in Connecticut.The Windsor Town Council, prompted by CT Witch Memorial, voted 9-0 in February to clear the names of Alse Young and Lydia Gilbert, who were hanged.Now Ms. Caruso and Mr. Griego hope other Connecticut communities \u2014 Fairfield, Farmington, Hartford, Stratford and Wethersfield \u2014 will follow Windsor\u2019s example.Paul Montinieri, the mayor of Wethersfield, said he had \u201cnever heard any commentary or expression on this topic\u201d from the community. However, if a grass-roots endeavor arose, he said the \u201ctown leadership would investigate it.\u201dJohn Q. Gale, a lawyer and member of Hartford\u2019s Court of Common Council, said he had \u201cnever had occasion to consider\u201d clearing the names of the women convicted in Hartford. However, \u201cthere should always be an effort to right all injustices,\u201d he said.Ms. Caruso said increased publicity about the state\u2019s history could benefit its tourism industry.\u201cThe exhibits about the Salem witch trials are some of the most visited tourist attractions in New England and bring an enormous amount of cash flow into Salem,\u201d she said.Professor Woodward said increased acknowledgment of Connecticut\u2019s witch history could have \u201cgreat potential for boosting tourism.\u201d However, he said, \u201cmany of the exact locations of particular events are either unknown or have been effaced through the centuries. There are also very few artifacts remaining from the period of the witch trials, so this would have to be a created story largely presented in imagined or simulated spaces.\u201dRandy Fiveash, the director of Connecticut\u2019s Office of Tourism, said he believed the state had not promoted its witch-trial history because no \u201cphysical place or venue that speaks to the events\u201d exists. \u201cSo, really, there isn\u2019t a there, there.\u201dPeter Gillespie, the director of planning and economic development in Wethersfield, said there could be significant tourism value in the history of the witch trials. But he also said he thought the witch trials were \u201ca part of the state\u2019s history that we are not very proud of and therefore not greatly interested in promoting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Gannon has been charged with driving with a suspended license and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to a police report, and Ms. McCaffrey, who was identified as the mother of the 8-month-old, is charged with child neglect and possession of opiates. The child was placed in court-ordered custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families on Tuesday, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office said.A lawyer for Ms. McCaffrey couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on Thursday afternoon. A lawyer for Mr. Gannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Graphic images of overdose victims shared on social media have stirred controversy in the past.

It\u2019s totally clear why Allen would issue such a statement \u2014 why he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to include the astonishing confession that \u201cno one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,\u201d implying that people did tell him about Weinstein but he, with that odd omniscience native to the very rich, deemed them insufficiently serious. It\u2019s also totally clear why Allen felt untouchable enough to add that even if he had believed the \u201chorror stories,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t have been interested, let alone concerned, because he is a serious man busy making serious man-art. He said people wouldn\u2019t bother coming to him anyway, because, as he described it: \u201cYou\u2019re not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie.\u201d (That last bit is fair, actually. If I\u2019d been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, literally my last instinct would be to go to Woody Allen for help.)It\u2019s clear because the cultural malfunction that allows Allen to feel comfortable issuing that statement is the same malfunction that gave us Allen and Weinstein in the first place: the smothering, delusional, galactic entitlement of powerful men.When Allen and other men warn of \u201ca witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere\u201d what they mean is an atmosphere in which they\u2019re expected to comport themselves with the care, consideration and fear of consequences that the rest of us call basic professionalism and respect for shared humanity. On some level, to some men \u2014 and you can call me a hysteric but I am done mincing words on this \u2014 there is no injustice quite so unnaturally, viscerally grotesque as a white man being fired.Donald Trump, our predator in chief, seems to view the election of Barack Obama as a white man being fired. He and his supporters are willing to burn the world in revenge. This whole catastrophic cultural moment was born of that same entitlement, of Trump\u2019s paws and Weinstein\u2019s unbelted bathrobe, of the ancient cycles of abuse that ghostwrote the Trump campaign\u2019s real slogan: If I can\u2019t have you, no one will.Setting aside the gendered power differential inherent in real historical witch hunts (pretty sure it wasn\u2019t all the rape victims in Salem getting together to burn the mayor), and the pathetic gall of men feeling hunted after millenniums of treating women like prey, I will let you guys have this one. Sure, if you insist, it\u2019s a witch hunt. I\u2019m a witch, and I\u2019m hunting you.In the past five years there has been a positive deluge of victims speaking out \u2014 an uncountable number that represents not just the acute trauma of an unwanted touch or a dehumanizing comment, but the invisible ripples of confidence lost, jobs quit, careers stalled, women\u2019s influence diminished, men\u2019s power entrenched.I keep thinking about what #MeToo would look like if it wasn\u2019t a roll call of people who\u2019ve experienced sexual predation, but a roll call of those who\u2019ve experienced sexual predation and actually seen their perpetrator brought to justice, whether professionally, legally or even personally. The number would be minuscule. Facebook\u2019s algorithm would bury it.So, Mr. Allen et al., I know you hate gossip and rumor mills, but unfortunately they\u2019re the only recourse we have. We wish it were different too. In a just system, Weinstein would have faced career-ruining social and professional consequences the first time he changed into a bathrobe and begged a horrified woman for a massage. In a just system, the abuse wouldn\u2019t have stayed an open secret for decades while he was left free to chew through generation after generation of starlets. Weinstein\u2019s life, like Cosby\u2019s, isn\u2019t the story of some tragic, pitiable downfall. It\u2019s the story of someone who got away with it.The witches are coming, but not for your life. We\u2019re coming for your legacy. The cost of being Harvey Weinstein is not getting to be Harvey Weinstein anymore. We don\u2019t have the justice system on our side; we don\u2019t have institutional power; we don\u2019t have millions of dollars or the presidency; but we have our stories, and we\u2019re going to keep telling them.

In his proudest moments, he resembles something like a theorist of transformation, decline and creation. In his lowest, he is more like a speaking canary, prone to prophecy, a game with losing odds. His attempts at optimism are framed as counterintuitive, faring little better, in predictive terms, than his lapses into pessimism. He teeters hazardously between implicating his audience and merely giving their anxieties a name. He \u2014 and it is almost always a he \u2014 is the critical equivalent of an unreliable narrator, unable to write about technology without also writing about himself. Occasionally, he is right: about what is happening, about what should happen, and about what it means. And so he carries on, and his audience with him.Franklin Foer, thankfully, recognizes these pitfalls even if he can\u2019t always avoid them. Who can? The melodramatically titled \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d Foer\u2019s compact attempt at a broad technological polemic \u2014 which identifies the stupendous successes of Amazon, Google and Facebook, among others, as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the individual and to society \u2014 begins with a disclaimer. Foer\u2019s tumultuous stint editing The New Republic under the ownership of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes ended with mass resignations and public acrimony. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this experience informs the argument of this book,\u201d he writes. He is likewise entangled through his proximity to publishing: The author\u2019s friends, colleagues and immediate family members \u2014 including his brother, the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer \u2014 depend to different degrees on the industry Amazon consumed first. The book is dedicated to his father, Bert, a crusading antitrust lawyer.In this slightly crouched posture, and with a hint of healthy self-doubt, Foer proceeds quickly. We, the consuming public, have failed to properly understand the new tech superpowers, he suggests, leaving little hope for stodgy and reluctant American regulators. The scope of their influence is obscured by the sheer number of things they do and sell, or problems they purport to be solving, and by our outdated sense of what constitutes a monopoly. To that end, Foer promotes the concept of the \u201cknowledge monopoly,\u201d which he qualifies with a mischievous grin. \u201cMy hope is that we revive \u2018monopoly\u2019 as a core piece of political rhetoric that broadly denotes dominant firms with pernicious powers,\u201d he says, rather than as a \u201ctechnical\u201d term referring to one company cornerning a market. (His new monopolists, after all, aren\u2019t raising prices. They\u2019re giving things away free).For much of the book, readers are parachuted into various moments in the history of computing, the internet, media and philosophy. Character introductions arrive rapidly, with a casualness that can slip into absurdity: Descartes \u201cenjoyed his sleep\u201d; Mark Zuckerberg \u201cis a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just a little bit naughty\u201d; Alan Turing was an \u201catheist and a loner,\u201d while Ray Kurzweil, the prophet of an artificial-intelligence-driven singularity, is driven by his inability to escape \u201cthe biggest fear of them all.\u201d (Death.) The effect is slightly delirious but genuinely enjoyable. Readers are flung through a highly selective history of the philosophy of mind, landing squarely on their feet in Google\u2019s A.I. laboratories. The 17th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\u2019s stubborn and total belief that knowledge could be reduced to mathematical computation leads surprisingly seamlessly into a perceptive assessment of Zuckerberg\u2019s fraught and inconsistent public relationship with the concept of the algorithm, his mission to connect the world and the billions of meaningful decisions made by Facebook\u2019s software every day.As Foer\u2019s book veers into advocacy, readers are treated to a similarly energetic and cleareyed view of the modern \u201cknowledge monopoly\u201d giants. Jeff Bezos\u2019 techno-populist suggestion that he can \u201csee the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere\u201d is contrasted with his personal purchase of The Washington Post and his stewardship over Amazon, which is a massive, diverse and participatory marketplace, but one under the control of a single private company with a reputation for ruthlessness and strong-arm negotiation tactics. \u201cOld gatekeepers might not always have been worthy of praise,\u201d Foer writes, \u201cbut at least there were a lot of them.\u201dFoer\u2019s other concession to nostalgia, in the form of an inoffensive command to return to the \u201csustaining nourishment of the contemplative life and the deep commitment to text,\u201d is overshadowed by a vigorous and novel call for regulatory intervention. He reminds us that the issue of monopoly dominated our politics for generations, even as the companies in the crosshairs changed in form and ambition. Though he makes no radical or provocative case to, say, nationalize Facebook, or to break up Google, he does suggest creating a Data Protection Authority, in the mold of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s post-financial-crisis Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and calling for government to protect privacy as it (in theory) protects the environment.Is this idealistic, plain crazy, or just impotent? The armchair technology critic \u2014 roused by Foer\u2019s sneakily persuasive manifesto \u2014 might ask in response, with a mixture of satisfaction and despair: What does it mean that it could be all three?John Herrman covers media for The Times Magazine.

The push for more photos will \u201cfurther advance and harmonize our response to the threat of terrorism,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.The addition of millions of images would better enable the Australian government to, for instance, use cameras to scan public crowds in search of crime suspects. It is also hoped that feeding the system with more faces could help combat Australia\u2019s growing problem of identity theft, which costs about 2.2 billion Australian dollars annually, or $1.7 billion, according to a 2016 government report.Several state leaders have already announced plans to comply with Mr. Turnbull\u2019s proposal, which in the future may expand to include photos from social media sites like Facebook.\u201cWhen it\u2019s a password database that\u2019s breached, you can just change your password. When it\u2019s facial recognition, you can\u2019t change your face,\u201d said Jeremy Malcolm, an analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cThis is one of the most personal identifiers that you have.\u201dOther privacy experts echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the long-term consequences of photos falling into the wrong hands.\u201cThe use of biometrics projects risk on every person involved, for the rest of their lives,\u201d said David Vaile, the chairman of the Australian Privacy Foundation. \u201cIf they\u2019re compromised or hacked, you\u2019re stuck with it. It\u2019s potentially a lifelong liability for it being misused.\u201d\u201cAs a proportionality exercise, it\u2019s unclear to me what the actual benefits are,\u201d Mr. Vaile said. \u201cWe already have a high-integrity identification system for various purposes. We have extremely low rates of terrorism. There\u2019s occasional activities that, by and large, existing mechanisms tend to catch.\u201dMr. Vaile said that emphasizing traditional community policing was a more urgent matter than implementing sweeping surveillance.

But terrorism is very potent politically for politicians who wish to use fear.\u201dMr. Vaile, making a Hollywood reference, said that the permanence of any breach of a facial recognition database should not be underestimated. \u201cDid you see the movie \u2018Minority Report\u2019?\u201d he said. \u201cHe had to take his eyeballs out once he\u2019d been compromised.\u201dAdam Baidawi reported from Melbourne, and Isabella Kwai from Sydney, Australia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Stanford Researchers Tried to Create a \u2018Gaydar\u2019 Machine", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichal Kosinski felt he had good reason to teach a machine to detect sexual orientation.And all around Silicon Valley, where Dr. Kosinski works as a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, entrepreneurs were talking about faces as if they were gold waiting to be mined.Few seemed concerned. So to call attention to the privacy risks, he decided to show that it was possible to use facial recognition analysis to detect something intimate, something \u201cpeople should have full rights to keep private.\u201dAfter considering atheism, he settled on sexual orientation.Presented with photos of gay men and straight men, a computer program was able to determine which of the two was gay with 81 percent accuracy, according to Dr. Kosinski and co-author Yilun Wang\u2019s paper.The backlash has been fierce.\u201cI imagined I\u2019d raise the alarm,\u201d Dr. Kosinski said in an interview. \u201cNow I\u2019m paying the price.\u201d He\u2019d just had a meeting with campus police \u201cbecause of the number of death threats.\u201dAt the heart of the controversy is rising concern about the potential for facial analysis to be misused and for findings about its effectiveness to be distorted.Indeed, few of the claims made by researchers or companies hyping its potential have been replicated, said Clare Garvie of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology.\u201cAt the very best, it\u2019s a highly inaccurate science,\u201d she said of promises to predict criminal behavior, intelligence and other character traits from faces. \u201cAt its very worst, this is racism by algorithm.\u201dDr. Kosinski and Mr. Wang began by copying, or \u201cscraping,\u201d photos from more than 75,000 online dating profiles of men and women in the United States. Those seeking same-sex partners were classified as gay; those seeking opposite-sex partners were assumed to be straight.Some 300,000 images were whittled down to 35,000 that showed faces clearly and met certain criteria. All were white, the researchers said, because they could not find enough dating profiles of gay minorities to generate a statistically valid result.The images were cropped further and then processed through a deep neural network, a layered mathematical system capable of identifying patterns in vast amounts of data.The software extracts information from thousands of facial data points, including nose width, mustache shape, eyebrows, corners of the mouth, hairline and even aspects of the face we don\u2019t have words for. It then turns the faces into numbers.\u201cWe showed that this model produces slightly different numbers for gay and straight faces,\u201d Dr. Kosinski said.The authors were then ready to pit their prediction model against humans in what would become a notorious gaydar competition. Both humans and machine were given pairings of two faces \u2014 one straight, one gay \u2014 and asked to pick who was more likely heterosexual.The participants, who were procured through Amazon Mechanical Turk, a supplier for digital tasks, were advised to \u201cuse the best of your intuition.\u201d They made the correct selection 54 percent of the time for women and 61 percent of the time for men \u2014 slightly better than flipping a coin.Dr. Kosinski\u2019s algorithm, by comparison, picked correctly 71 percent for of the time for women and 81 percent for men. When the computer was given five photos for each person instead of just one, accuracy rose to 83 percent for women and 91 percent for the men.Yet none of the scenarios remotely resembled a scan of people \u201cin the wild,\u201d as Ms. Garvie put it. And when the tool was challenged with other scenarios \u2014 such as distinguishing between gay men\u2019s Facebook photos and straight men\u2019s online dating photos \u2014 accuracy dropped to 74 percent.There\u2019s also the issue of false positives, which plague any prediction model aimed at identifying a minority group, said William T.L. Cox, a psychologist who studies stereotypes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Let\u2019s say 5 percent of the population is gay, or 50 of every 1,000 people. A facial scan that is 91 percent accurate would misidentify 9 percent of straight people as gay; in the example above, that\u2019s 85 people.The software would also mistake 9 percent of gay people as straight people. The result: Of 130 people the facial scan identified as gay, 85 actually would be straight.\u201cWhen an algorithm with 91 percent accuracy operates in the real world,\u201d Dr. Cox said, \u201calmost two-thirds of the times it says someone is gay, it would be wrong.\u201dHe noted in an email that \u201cthe algorithms were only trained and tested on white, American, openly gay men (and white, American, presumed straight comparisons),\u201d and therefore probably would not have broader implications.Regardless of effectiveness, the study raises knotty questions about perceptions of sexual orientation.\u201cCan artificial intelligence actually tell if you\u2019re gay from your face? It feels weird \u2014 it feels like physiognomy,\u201d he said.\u201cI still personally sometimes feel uncomfortable, and I have to reconcile this as a scientist \u2014 but this is what the data shows,\u201d said Dr. Rule, who is gay.That is not to say that all LGBTQ people have the similar facial features, or even that there are only two kinds of sexuality, he said. But to pretend that sexual orientation is invisible \u201csuffocates our ability to approach inequity.\u201dGiven that the Stanford study was based on dating profile photos \u2014 which may contain all kinds of additional hints about preferences \u2014 the results should be taken with \u201cnot just a grain, but a tablespoon of salt,\u201d he added.Liking curly fries, for example, was a reliable predictor of higher than average intelligence. Liking Wu-Tang Clan was a tip-off to male heterosexuality. All of our online likes, Dr. Kosinski said, have left us vulnerable to microtargeting by political candidates, companies and others with nefarious intentions.Within several weeks of publication, Facebook had changed its default settings, keeping likes private. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar\u201d to the controversy over his current project, he said. \u201cI was basically trying to warn people. People didn\u2019t take it seriously.\u201dA major difference, though, is that Dr. Kosinski did not attempt to explain why \u201cliking\u201d curly fries indicated intelligence. It was simply a pattern identified by a machine.To account for a link between appearance and sexuality, Dr. Kosinski went further, drawing on what his study called \u201cthe widely accepted prenatal hormone theory (P.H.T.) of sexual orientation,\u201d which \u201cpredicts the existence of links between facial appearance and sexual orientation\u201d determined by early hormone exposure.The notion that it\u2019s \u201cwidely accepted\u201d was quickly disputed.Even many experts who are supportive of the theory, said they could not see how a study of self-selected dating photos made the case that gay people have gender-atypical faces, let alone a theory that attributes distinctive features to hormones.The discussion of P.H.T. made the authors sound out of touch, said Dr. Cox: \u201cMost sex scientists agree that there is no single cause to sexual orientation.\u201dDr. Kosinski and Mr. Wang say that the algorithm is responding to fixed facial features, like nose shape, along with \u201cgrooming choices,\u201d such as eye makeup.But it\u2019s also possible that the algorithm is seeing something totally unknown.Only later did analysts realize that the American tanks had been photographed on a sunny day and the Russian tanks had been photographed on a cloudy day. The computer had learned to detect brightness.Dr. Kosinski said that they went to great lengths to guarantee that such confounders did not influence their results. Still, he agreed that it\u2019s easier to teach a machine to see than to understand what it has seen.The study is on still on track to be published by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, though no date has been set. The paper had already made its way through the official peer review process before unofficial reviewers began ripping it to shreds.Dr. Kosinski\u2019s reputation may be permanently damaged, he said, but he has no regrets. Officials in a country where homosexuality is criminalized someday soon may turn to facial analysis to identify gay men and women.\u201cThe question is, can you live with yourself if you knew it\u2019s possible and you didn\u2019t let anyone know?\u201d he asked.An article on Tuesday about attempts to use facial recognition software to detect sexual orientation misstated the name of a school where Rebecca Jordan Young is chairwoman of women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies. It is Barnard College, not Barnard University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wary of Hackers, States Move to Upgrade Voting Systems", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 State election officials, worried about the integrity of their voting systems, are pressing to make them more secure ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.Reacting in large part to Russian efforts to hack the presidential election last year, a growing number of states are upgrading electoral databases and voting machines, and even adding cybersecurity experts to their election teams. The efforts \u2014 from both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 amount to the largest overhaul of the nation\u2019s voting infrastructure since the contested presidential election in 2000 spelled an end to punch-card ballots and voting machines with mechanical levers.One aim is to prepare for the 2018 and 2020 elections by upgrading and securing electoral databases and voting machines that were cutting-edge before Facebook and Twitter even existed. Another is to spot and defuse attempts to depress turnout and sway election results by targeting voters with false news reports and social media posts.West Virginia\u2019s elections team has added a cybersecurity expert from the state National Guard with a top-secret federal security clearance. Colorado and Rhode Island will now verify election results via an advanced statistical procedure called a risk-limiting audit.Delaware is moving its voter-registration list off the state\u2019s aging mainframe computer and preparing to replace a 21-year-old electronic voting system that does not leave a paper record of votes to be audited.Last month, a panel of state, federal and private election experts completed a sweeping revision of guidelines for manufacturers of new voting equipment, the first major overhaul in a dozen years. While the guidelines are voluntary, they are endorsed by all but three states, so manufacturers effectively must meet the new standards to sell their equipment in most of the nation.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is a psy-ops operation,\u201d said Mac Warner, the West Virginia secretary of state. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Russians are running against us now, trying to erode confidence in our democratic process. We need to assure our citizens that we\u2019re aware of these attacks, that we have assistance to counter them, and that when they do occur, don\u2019t panic \u2014 there are resources to turn to.\u201dIn an era of bitter political divisions and elections-rules disputes, the effort to make the vote more secure is notably bipartisan and relatively rancor-free. Republicans like Mr. Warner are largely aligned with Democrats on the need to act before the next presidential election in 2020, and there is some support in both parties in Congress for helping to finance changes.\u201cIt\u2019s really important not to overstate the risk. There are lots of things that can be done to make sure machines are as secure as possible,\u201d Lawrence Norden, the deputy director of the Democracy Project at the Brennan Center for Justice of the New York University School of Law. \u201cBut when you\u2019re dealing with a nation-state, you have to assume that at some point they\u2019re going to be successful in their efforts to breach things. The question then becomes resiliency and the ability to show people that you can fix things even if there is a breach.\u201dState officials, who zealously guard their control of elections, have greeted federal efforts to address voting security with wariness. But that, too, has changed. State election directors who were blindsided and angered by the Homeland Security department\u2019s critical infrastructure designation will meet with department officials in Atlanta this month to discuss how they can share information about threats. The department also is working to give state election officials security clearances so they can view classified assessments of dangers to the election system.He said the shared guidelines would allow for the deployment of election software on products like tablets and iPads, which could be ready as soon as the 2020 election, rather than force 50 states to put together their own systems. \u201cIt\u2019s going to drive innovation, hopefully save money for election officials, and allow us to test and certify equipment more efficiently,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Masterson said.Foreign governments that regularly crack the computers of military contractors and federal agencies will not be daunted by the cyberdefenses of voter databases and electronic pollbooks. A determined adversary could compromise voting equipment at many points along the supply chain, from the factory assembler to the election software programmer to the technician who makes a repair or installs a software upgrade. And in an industry dominated by a handful of companies, malicious tinkering could have a broad impact.\u201cIn computer security, you\u2019re talking much more about the capabilities of local jurisdictions,\u201d said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technology officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. \u201cAnd they vary dramatically, from L.A., which has a small army of folks, to many jurisdictions that don\u2019t even have a full-time person for their election work. To the extent they have an ability to defend against these attacks, it\u2019s quite limited.\u201dMr. Hall said election officials need to be even more vigilant, and impose a \u201czero-trust networking\u201d policy on their agencies. \u201cDon\u2019t assume that because something is locked in a case that it\u2019s safe,\u201d he said. \u201cAssume they\u2019re already in your system, and set up things that will catch them \u2014 honey pots, fake data stores. If anyone hits them, then you know someone\u2019s poking around.\u201dBipartisan legislation in both the House and Senate would provide a modest amount of federal money for new machines. But prospects for passage are uncertain, and many states are unable or unwilling to fill the breach.The South Carolina Election Commission estimates that it could cost $40 million to replace the state\u2019s antiquated voting equipment with machines that used auditable paper ballots. So far the State Legislature has come up with $1 million, said Chris Whitmire, a spokesman for the commission.\u201cWe\u2019re using the same equipment we\u2019ve used since 2004,\u201d he said. \u201cIf $40 million dropped into our hands today, we\u2019d have a paper ballot trail, too.\u201dBut even states that cannot afford more secure machines are taking steps to harden their election systems and bolster public confidence in the vote. South Carolina has accepted an offer of free \u201ccyberhygiene\u201d scans of its system by Homeland Security experts. Colorado is upgrading its voting equipment, but it has also begun to receive Homeland Security screenings, added national guard security experts to its election team and tacked a basic security measure onto its voter-registration database: two-step authentication for anyone seeking to log into the system.State election officials are now in regular contact with federal security and intelligence agencies about threats to the vote, said Trevor Timmons, the chief information officer for Wayne W. Williams, the Colorado secretary of state.\u201cI\u2019ve spent more time talking to three-letter agencies in the last year than I have in my entire career,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

That may prove true. But getting there is turning into a nightmare \u2014 a world where billions of people are connected but without sufficient legal structures, security protections or moral muscles among companies and users to handle all these connections without abuse.Lately, it feels as if we\u2019re all connected but no one\u2019s in charge.Equifax, the credit reporting bureau, became brilliant at vacuuming up all your personal credit data \u2014 without your permission \u2014 and selling it to companies that wanted to lend you money. But it was so lax in securing that data that it failed to install simple software security fixes, leaving a hole for hackers to get the Social Security numbers and other personal information of some 146 million Americans, or nearly half the country.Facebook, Google and Twitter are different animals in my mind. Twitter has enabled more people than ever to participate in the global conversation; Facebook has enabled more people than ever to connect and build communities; Google has enabled everyone to find things like never before.Those are all good things. But the three companies are also businesses, and the last election suggests they\u2019ve all connected more people than they can manage and they\u2019ve been na\u00efve about how many bad guys were abusing their platforms.As Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it to me, \u201cUp to now these companies have not taken the threat that Russia and other foreign agents pose to our system seriously enough or invested enough or to really reveal what happened in 2016 \u2014 or what is still happening now.\u201dLast November, Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg dismissed as \u201ca pretty crazy idea\u201d evidence that people were using Facebook to generate fake news to tip the U.S. election. Last week, after disclosing hundreds of Russia-linked accounts \u2014 where fictional people posing as U.S. activists spread inflammatory messages about immigration and guns and trashed Hillary Clinton and boosted Donald Trump \u2014 Zuckerberg admitted, \u201cCalling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it.\u201dOne reason Facebook was slow to respond is that its business model was to absorb all of the readers of the mainstream media newspapers and magazines and to absorb all their advertisers \u2014 but as few of their editors as possible. An editor is a human being you have to pay to bring editorial judgment to content on your website, to make sure things are accurate and to correct them if they\u2019re not. Social networks preferred to use algorithms instead, but these are easily gamed.Twitter\u2019s presentation, said Senator Warner, \u201cshowed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions.\u201d It was \u201cfrankly inadequate on every level.\u201dEvery week we are coming to realize that we do not know the depth of this Russian hacking \u2014 and that the people who did it were incredibly sophisticated, not only about the technology platforms but also about which districts and demographics to target with just the right inflammatory messages.America\u2019s democracy is built on two principles: truth and trust. We trust that our elections are fair and that enables our peaceful rotations of power. And we trust that the news we get from our mainstream outlets is true and that it is corrected if it is not. And we expect our president to defend both. But today many people are getting news from platforms that are easily polluted by Russian or other hackers with fake news. And our president is a liar who refuses to hold Russia to account for anything. It\u2019s a terrible combination.We can\u2019t fix Trump right now. But have Equifax and these big social networks become so much part of the wiring of our lives \u2014 and the impacts of their failures so consequential \u2014 that they should be regulated in new ways? I don\u2019t know, but I know it\u2019s time for this discussion. It\u2019s already started.Said Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, \u201cWe must update our laws to ensure that when political ads are sold online Americans know who paid for them.\u201dThese companies make billions selling our data, but they\u2019re ambivalent about taking responsibility \u201cfor the uses, and abuses, of their platforms,\u201d argued the Harvard political philosopher Michael Sandel. \u201cThey can\u2019t have it both ways. If they claim they are neutral pipes and wires, like the phone company or the electric company, they should be regulated as public utilities. But if, on the other hand, they want to claim the freedoms associated with news media, they can\u2019t deny responsibility for promulgating fake news.\u201dIn the early 20th century, added Sandel, \u201cthe rise of monopolies and concentrated economic power brought forth an era of progressive reform that regulated railroads, banks and utilities in the public interest. Today, we need a similar spirit of reform. These platforms are so dominant that, like electric wires or telephone lines, we can scarcely avoid using them. But when they allow our personal data \u2014 or elections \u2014 to be hacked, there\u2019s not much we can do about it.\u201d\u201cA century ago, we found ways to rein in the unaccountable power associated with the Industrial Revolution,\u201d concluded Sandel. \u201cToday, we need to figure out how to rein in the unaccountable power associated with the digital revolution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It would be a shame to overcook your hard-earned haul.Broiling or grilling can cause lean, white-fleshed fish like halibut (but also thick flounder fillets, snapper, grouper and large sea scallops) to dry out. For moist, juicy results, frying or searing is the best option. I tend to use a simple searing method for cooking firm, white-fleshed fish on the stovetop; it\u2019s easier and cleaner than frying.For best results, use a cast-iron pan, or any other heavy nonstick pan (even a griddle). Coat the pan with olive oil, and let it get hot before you put in the fish fillets. Leave the fish undisturbed until it is nicely golden on the first side, then flip it and cook the second side until just done.With perfectly pristine fresh fish, you want no sauce at all \u2014 or a sauce that enhances without distracting from the fish\u2019s flavor. Sometimes, the best solution is a drizzle of olive oil and a lemon wedge.For something a bit fancier and not much more effort, a quick sauce made in the pan is a good choice, too. A browned butter sauce, what French cooks call beurre noisette, tastes rich and nutty. You make it at the very last minute, just after the fish comes out of the pan.When a chunk of cold butter hits the hot pan, it immediately begins to sizzle and foam. Be careful to cook the butter until it just starts to brown, then turn off the heat. As when making caramel, residual heat will continue to cook the mixture, and the brown will deepen. You want the sauce to taste toasty, not burned, and there\u2019s a fine line. To stop the browning and supply a welcome citrusy hit, give it a squeeze of lemon.As an additional enhancement, throw a handful of fresh sage leaves into the pan. It is amazing how immediately the sage flavor permeates the sauce. The herb contrasts nicely with both butter and fish, and the subtle combination is quite wonderful.The brown butter and sage sauce \u2014 a classic Italian combination \u2014 has other uses.

{"Headline": "A Warming Curry for Fall", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenI had mushrooms on my mind, like an insidious song going round and round in my brain. It became clear there was only one way to stop the cycle: having some for dinner.Rather than the Italianate mushroom stew I often make to serve with polenta, I craved something with more personality, perhaps a spicy, creamy curry. Curried mushrooms, curried mushrooms, sang the inner voice.Whenever I\u2019m cooking with Indian ingredients, I consult one of Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s many cookbooks for guidance and inspiration. Ms. Jaffrey\u2019s recipes are inventively streamlined for non-Indian cooks, but with no sacrifice of flavor. In \u201cVegetarian India\u201d (Knopf, 2015), she offers several mushroom curries from different regions.With fall weather approaching, I decided my curry also needed some autumn vegetables, for a heartier meal. Saut\u00e9ed cubes of butternut squash, with their warm color, appealed to me the most \u2014 though sweet potatoes, parsnips or carrots would work, too.Of course, ordinary button mushrooms can be used, but a mixture of cultivated mushrooms in all shapes and sizes makes a splashier dish. I like oyster mushrooms, especially royal trumpets, a large, meaty type. A few shiitake caps (the stems are tough, best used for making stock) contribute a woodsy flavor, and small brown portobellos add depth. Tiny white enoki are beautiful, too, and can be stirred into the curry right at the end.For a more deluxe version, I was lucky enough to get my hands on some wild golden chanterelles. My mushroom guy had wild hen-of-the-woods and lobster mushrooms. Your selection depends on your budget, the season and what\u2019s available where you live.There are just a few spices and seasonings to assemble: green chiles, garlic, cumin, coriander, cayenne and turmeric. Fresh curry leaves, if you can find them, are aromatic and floral when simmered with the mushrooms (they don\u2019t taste like curry powder). Most Indian groceries have them, fresh or frozen. Substitute whole basil leaves if you wish, or go without.You can make this curry as spicy as you wish, but be sure to include at least a little cayenne and green chile, to play off the creamy coconut sauce. A final addition of lime juice supplies a necessary, welcome hit of acidity.This is welcome comfort food, Indian-style: bright, rich and ready in less than an hour.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lost in New York at Public Kitchen", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review9 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.To get inside you walk down a hedgerow of rhododendrons flanked by two small lawns where hotel guests alight on Adirondack chairs as if they were up in the mountains and not a knish\u2019s throw away from Chrystie Street. The scene changes once you come through the revolving front doors to face a pair of escalators reflected off into infinity by polished metal mirrors. It may remind you of the entrance to a mall, and the tacit message is similar: Keep circulating until you see something you want.Around the escalators to the right you come to a Vongerichten-run grab-and-go market and beyond that, the first of two Vongerichten-catered bars. While the other offers snacky highlights from the Public Kitchen menu, this one serves the whole megillah. At the far end of the bar you reach the entrance to the restaurant. Strangely, it\u2019s one of Public\u2019s least interesting rooms, a yawning, noisy canteen whose walls are tiled with the same shiny marble that more expensive hotels put in their showers.I\u2019ve led you on this hotel tour to help make sense of Public Kitchen. The menu is a kaleidoscope because Mr. Vongerichten and Thomas McKenna, his executive chef, are trying to offer up something for many moods and occasions. Customers who don\u2019t grasp the I\u2665NY concept when they see pasta and pizza and Chinese food will still find something to eat, whether they\u2019re drinking mezcal below the Diego Rivera-inspired tapestry on the second floor or settling in for a couple of hours at the restaurant.One snack is so popular it\u2019s already a classic of sorts: popcorn under a thin Frisbee of fried Cheddar sprinkled with chives and chile flakes. I didn\u2019t totally get it, but it was a fun thing to crunch on with a drink in my other hand. So were the little latkes topped with sour cream, trout roe and smoked salmon, straight from the hors d\u2019oeuvres tray of the fanciest Hanukkah party you\u2019ve ever attended.Smart ideas pop up all over the place. Rigatoni with yellow wax beans and gold tomatoes is saved from ordinariness by a very good pesto in which pistachios do the work of pine nuts. Shrimp toast, one of those foods that are likable even when they\u2019re bad, is exceptionally good at Public Kitchen, where the crunch of water chestnuts is pitted against tender, unusually sweet shrimp.There\u2019s a phenomenally good steak marinated in soy sauce and dressed with fermented black soybeans and sesame oil. Also wonderful: roasted hake with sweet and spicy peppers interrupted by shards of fried potato.But, unusually for one of Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s recent restaurants, a number of dishes don\u2019t achieve liftoff. At my first meal I was nonplused by the shrimp cocktail: The shrimp were warm but served on ice, and the cocktail sauce was a bizarre and acidic collision of peaches and horseradish. The last time I went, these hot-and-cold shrimp weren\u2019t on the menu. I hope they are using their time away to think about the choices they\u2019ve made.Nothing else was so misconceived. But spicy avocado dip punched the lights out of a delicately flaky Chinese scallion pancake with basil in place of scallions. Nondescript cheese, bland mushrooms and a pointless egg dragged down a pizza with a very good, light crust. And Manhattan clam chowder, repurposed as a sauce for a fine, clean-tasting hunk of pan-seared salmon, was the answer to a question nobody asked.The only reason I can think of for hijacking red chowder like this is to make a connection with New York. But with a few exceptions, Public Kitchen doesn\u2019t explore the city\u2019s food in a coherent or illuminating way. And it doesn\u2019t come close to hitting, as the website puts it, \u201call of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is New York City.\u201d Thai flavors animate one side dish, roasted carrots in red curry paste and coconut milk. But the main cuisines brought into play are Italian and Chinese, as if it were still 1970.A good menu doesn\u2019t need a theme to hang together, of course. The pastry chef, Eric Kalaboke, found a through line in slightly old-fashioned favorites like a fruit cobbler capped with sweet sticks of puff pastry, an extremely endearing chocolate layer cake with blackberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream, and a quietly spectacular tartufo resting in sour-cherry syrup. As for the wine list, it does a great job of presenting reasonably priced bottles from all over, made by some of the leading producers in their regions. This is a nice surprise in a hotel that seems to have been built as a backdrop for the cocktail lifestyle.Still, it\u2019s a sign of trouble that what Public Kitchen is trying to pull off doesn\u2019t come across clearly. You can have a meal that is mostly very good, or one that is decidedly mixed, but either way you will probably walk out not entirely sure what sets this restaurant apart, other than Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s sensibility.He doesn\u2019t layer flavors like anyone else. These days he doesn\u2019t have as many imitators as he used to, either, although his spicy tuna tartare slicked with sesame oil will be with us forever. He trots it out again at Public Kitchen, over sliced avocado, with an undulated rice cracker that left oil on my fingers.It\u2019s hard to tell whether he\u2019s repeating himself, making a sly comment on how pervasive the dish is in New York, or both.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Big Bet on Streaming Relies on Little-Known Tech Company", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor two days in late June, Disney\u2019s board of directors gathered at Walt Disney World in Florida to wrestle with one topic: how technology was disrupting the company\u2019s traditional movie, television and theme park businesses, and what to do about it?The most startling presentation came from Disney\u2019s biggest division \u2014 a $24 billion television operation anchored by ESPN and Disney Channel. Cord cutting was accelerating much faster than expected. Live viewing for some children\u2019s programming was in free fall. At the same time, streaming services like Netflix were experiencing explosive growth.And that was how the Disney board, which includes Silicon Valley stars like Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, came to bet the entertainment giant\u2019s future on a wonky, little-known technology company housed in a former cookie factory: BamTech.In August, Disney announced that it would introduce two subscription streaming services, both built by BamTech. One, focused on sports programming and made available through the ESPN app, would arrive in the spring. The other, centered on movies and television shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, would debut in late 2019.\u201cWe\u2019re going to launch big, and we\u2019re going to launch hot,\u201d Mr. Iger promised at a subsequent investor conference.Disney had experimented with building a streaming platform on its own, to mixed results. It also toyed with the idea of buying Twitter.But Mr. Iger was impressed with BamTech. Based in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea Market, a former factory for the National Biscuit Company, the 850-employee company has a strong track record \u2014 no serious glitches, even when delivering tens of millions of live streams at a time. BamTech also has impressive advertising technology (inserting ads in video based on viewer location) and a strong reputation for attracting and keeping viewers, not to mention billing them.\u201cBamTech really is as good as it gets,\u201d said Mike Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and technology consultant.BamTech grew out of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam for short, which was founded in 2000 as a way to help teams create websites. By 2002, Bam was experimenting with streaming video as a way for out-of-town fans to watch games.Soon, Bam developed technology that attracted outside clients, including the WWE, Fox Sports, PlayStation Vue and Hulu. HBO went to Bam in 2014 after failing to create a reliable stand-alone streaming service on its own. Could Bam get HBO up and running \u2014 in just a few months?Bam built HBO Now for roughly $50 million, delivering it just in time for the Season 5 premiere of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which went off flawlessly. \u201cThey were nothing short of herculean for us,\u201d said Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s chief executive.Disney started talking about the inevitable shift toward streaming in 2006, according to Kevin Mayer, Disney\u2019s chief strategy officer. But the world\u2019s largest entertainment company had to be careful: It could not embrace a new business model at the expense of its still highly profitable existing one \u2014 at least not until it saw a tipping point.So Disney, along with other television companies, first tried something called TV Everywhere. Introduced in 2010, it allowed people to watch television shows on mobile devices as long as they \u201cauthenticated\u201d themselves as current cable or satellite subscribers. But that cable bundle-saving effort proved cumbersome and never completely caught on.About three years ago, Disney started to look at streaming more aggressively. Disney experimented with going it alone, quietly developing an app called DisneyLife. Introduced in November 2015 in Britain, DisneyLife offered old Disney movies and television series, children\u2019s e-books, games and music. Subscriptions cost about $13 a month.The lesson from that was without new movies, or at least exclusive content, interest was limited. Disney soon cut the subscription price in half. After two years, analysts estimate that DisneyLife has only about 437,000 subscribers. (It was never introduced outside Britain.)So when Mr. Iger decided in June that the time had come to reposition Disney\u2019s television division for growth by offering its sports, movies and television programming directly to consumers, he asked BamTech to accelerate Disney\u2019s option to take a controlling interest. By early August, Disney had agreed to spend an additional $1.58 billion to bring its BamTech stake to 75 percent.Most analysts cheered Disney\u2019s streaming plans, but some investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach. One reason is cost.Start-up expenses are unknown, but Disney has signaled that they will be huge. (Analysts estimate that marketing alone could easily run $150 million annually.) Disney has also not announced how much it will charge for subscriptions to the still-unnamed services. (Analysts are guessing $5 to $9 a month.) What is certain: To stock its own offerings, Disney plans to pull content from other services \u2014 Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm movies will eventually disappear from Netflix \u2014 eliminating an enormous, reliable revenue stream.Michael Nathanson, a media analyst, estimates that Netflix, for instance, pays Disney $325 million annually to license those films. Also moving to one of the services will be reruns of Disney Channel shows, which generate roughly $500 million annually in third-party licensing fees, according to Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at UBS.At the same time, Disney has pledged to make original movies and series for its nonsports service, easily adding $150 million in costs.There has also been some sniping about how much Disney paid for BamTech. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference last month, Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, boasted that his company\u2019s All Access and Showtime streaming services had been built internally.Disney contends that a big part of BamTech\u2019s value has been overlooked. Down the road, as other media companies move toward streaming, BamTech intends to sign them up as clients.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a massive business, and BamTech is going to be a massive winner in it,\u201d Mr. Mayer, Disney\u2019s chief strategist, said in an interview.Still, by the end of next year, BamTech will lose one important customer: HBO, which is moving to a global platform built by its own tech team. \u201cThey understood from the very beginning that eventually we would grow our way to independence,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.For some, Disney\u2019s track record with digital acquisitions is the biggest concern.Before a turnaround in recent years, Disney.com gave the company headaches, with managers trying a series of redesigns and strategic retrenchments.Mr. Paull, a Harvard M.B.A. with experience at Sony Music, will report to Mr. Mayer, who joined Disney in 1993 before leaving in 2000 to run Playboy.com. He soon returned to Disney to work on Go.com, a web portal that eventually failed, and other Disney websites, including ESPN.com, before moving to strategic planning.Though BamTech has proved its streaming bona fides, it still lacks the algorithms and the personalization skills that have helped propel Netflix to success. To fill that gap, Mr. Paull recently hired the former chief technology officer of the F.B.I. to be the head of analytics.BamTech\u2019s headquarters are a massive sprawl. Inside the darkened \u201ctransmission operations center\u201d on a recent afternoon, walls of monitors displayed hundreds of live events \u2014 baseball, golf, hockey, boxing, a speech by President Trump \u2014 being streamed to somewhere at that moment.Outside the operations room, in a series of alcoves, including one that used to house an oven where Oreos were baked, employees monitor games and are the first line of defense if something goes wrong with a stream. They\u2019re nicknamed the Night\u2019s Watch, from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dThe level of engineering required for that enormous volume of content is no small matter. Each bit of streamable content has to be made to fit a dizzying number of requirements. Start with web browsers, ranging from Safari to Chrome or Explorer, all of which have slightly different demands. It also has to fit every iPhone and Android phone. And then there are connected living room devices like Apple TV.\u201cThe complexity there is incredible,\u201d Mr. Paull said during a tour. \u201cIt\u2019s thousands and thousands of different applications we need to build to support that entire ecosystem. Then you add in international and the complexities of languages, currencies, payment mechanisms.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s one of the big, big barriers to entry if you want to have a scaled digital video service.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and a picture caption misstated the prior work experience of Michael Paull, the chief executive of BamTech. He oversaw Amazon Prime Video and introduced Amazon Channels; he did not introduce Prime Video.Brooks Barnes reported from Burbank, Calif., and John Koblin from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "23 Women Accuse Former Queens Priest of Abusing Them as Children", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former teacher at a Catholic school in Queens who said she had reported the sexual abuse of seven female students by a priest in 1991 now claims that the Diocese of Brooklyn covered it up for more than a decade, allowing more girls to be abused.Mr. Prochaski was based at Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in Maspeth for nearly 25 years. He is accused of abusing the girls between 1972 and 1994, when they were between the ages 5 and 16.In New York State, no criminal or civil litigation can take place for most child sex abuse crimes after a victim turns 23. But an exception can be made for rape. The New York Police Department was investigating whether any of the recent allegations qualify for prosecution, a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney\u2019s office said.He said the women cannot comment themselves because of the pending investigation.Outside the Queens church, Ms. Porcaro said: \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, it\u2019s really horrible. And what kills me is that it could have been stopped. And I don\u2019t know why no one would do it.\u201dMs. Porcaro, 63, said that at the end of 1990, seven fifth-graders told her that Father Prochaski was sexually abusing them. Most were Polish immigrants whose families had been brought to America with the help of the priest, to whom they felt beholden.She said she reported the abuse to the principal, a nun from the Sisters of the Holy Family order. She said the nun laughed and said, \u201cOh, everybody knows about Father Adam,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd I had tears in my eyes.\u201dThat principal left, and in 1991, Ms. Porcaro reported the abuse to the next principal. This time, she said, the diocese sent people to ask the students questions. But Father Prochaski remained as the administrator of the school and the parish\u2019s pastor.Carolyn Erstad, a spokeswoman for the diocese, denied on Wednesday that the diocese had received any allegations about Father Prochaski in 1991. She said two women came directly to the diocese in 1994 to report that they were abused as children by him. Separately, a principal and teacher reported that he had abused children. The diocese confronted Father Prochaski and he denied the allegations, she said.Ms. Erstad said that in October 1994, Father Prochaski resigned, and that in 1995, he wrote a letter cutting all ties with the diocese. He has not served as a priest since.Ms. Erstad acknowledged that it was not until 2002 that the Brooklyn Diocese notified law enforcement about the allegations. That was the year American bishops passed the Dallas Charter, requiring that dioceses report all allegations of sexual abuse of minors to public authorities. By then, none of the allegations against Mr. Prochaski were within the statute of limitations for prosecution, the spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney said.After resigning as pastor, Mr. Prochaski, now 75, moved to Ridgewood, Queens, and married.Mr. Prochaski did not return a request for comment, and a man leaving his home said he could not comment on the situation.In June, the Brooklyn Diocese began a program to offer survivors of clergy sexual abuse monetary awards, if they agreed to pursue no further legal action against the diocese. This summer, Mr. Garabedian said, a woman who claimed to be one of Mr. Prochaski\u2019s victims asked him for help in applying.A Facebook post then circulated, seeking additional victims, and Ms. Porcaro, who remains in touch with many of her former students, reposted it. \u201cMy computer went bonkers,\u201d she said. Women she had never met began calling her to ask for guidance. \u201cThey thought they were the only ones,\u201d she said.Since it began, the Brooklyn sex abuse compensation program has received 211 claims and made 76 offers. Sixty settlements have been accepted. The initial deadline for applying for funds is Sunday, but victims who have never previously come forward may apply in a second phase. Mr. Garabedian said settlements have ranged between $100,000 and $500,000.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Myanmar, Once a Hope for Democracy, Is Now a Study in How It Fails", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 Nearly a decade into Myanmar\u2019s transition out of military rule, the country\u2019s once-celebrated transition toward democracy is hardening into something very different from what activists and world leaders had hoped for.Citizens select their leaders, but without the robust institutions or norms like pluralism, universal rights or tolerance necessary for democracy to function.They express, in surveys and social media, desire for a strongman-style leader and raw majority rule. Democracy, many say, should be guided by religious strictures and nationalism.The military\u2019s ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group, is popular, as are social controls against journalists and minorities.The civilian state, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, is rapidly centralizing power as checks and balances erode. It is growing oppressive in some areas and weak in others, ceding public space to extremists. Meanwhile, the military still controls important government functions and a perpetual quota of Parliament seats.The country appears to be converging on a democratic-authoritarian hybrid, formally known as illiberal democracy, which often resembles mob rule. It is a version of majority rule that excludes minorities, curtails freedoms and governs arbitrarily.\u201cMyanmar\u2019s biggest threat is not the return of dictatorship but an illiberal democracy,\u201d said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official.The country, only a few years into its democracy, is at the outset of a second transition that could be just as consequential.Myanmar appears to follow a pattern that Jack Snyder, a Columbia University political scientist, first articulated in the 1990s to explain why a rash of new democracies had collapsed into war or dictatorships.Conventional wisdom dismissed those societies as unready for democracy. But Mr. Snyder found a more complex explanation.Rapid shifting to democracy can scramble the relationships that bond citizens and leaders. A successful transition will create new relationships that include everyone. But certain risk factors seem especially likely to derail the process.When institutions are weak and leaders see the old elite as a threat, those leaders often hollow out their own governments for fear of a coup, setting the state up to implode.When rapid social change and deep ethnic divisions coincide, society and politics can fracture, setting ethnic groups on a battle for control, as happened in Rwanda and Bosnia.And when public demands rise but governance is weak, both citizens and leaders can adopt views that are authoritarian in all but name, as they did in 1990s Russia.Virtually all those warning signs are present in Myanmar. The canaries in the coal mine of democracy \u2014 minorities, journalists, activists \u2014 are already falling.Daw Nyo Nyo Thin, a Japanese-educated lawyer and former lawmaker, was once a poster child for Myanmar\u2019s new democracy.Brash and technocratic, she cultivated grass-roots support, whereas the party handed most lawmakers their positions. When she joined the National League for Democracy, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party, it looked like democracy taking root.But shortly before Myanmar\u2019s first fully democratic elections, in 2015, the party dropped her from the ticket. Running independently, she lost.It was a microcosm of politics under Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has steamrollered those with independent support or reputations for speaking out.\u201cThe previous government cared about people like me \u2014 student leaders, opposition leaders, politicians \u2014 because it needed them,\u201d Ms. Nyo Nyo Thin said. \u201cBut this government, they don\u2019t care.\u201dMs. Aung San Suu Kyi has doled out jobs to loyalists, though many lack qualifications or training. She has consolidated power so tightly that analysts say the government effectively shuts down when she travels.She appears driven by a combination of expediency \u2014 her popularity has seemingly allowed her to skip democratic niceties like coalition-building \u2014 and fear.\u201cThey believe they will face a military coup if they face too much criticism,\u201d Ms. Nyo Nyo Thin said of party leaders. \u201cAny critics, any opposing views, should be silent.\u201dDemocratization often starts with a pact between the old and new leaders. In South Africa, F. W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president, and his successor, Nelson Mandela, cooperated to hold society and institutions together.\u201cThere was no de Klerk-Mandela partnership here,\u201d said Aaron Connelly, an analyst with the Lowy Institute, based in Sydney, Australia. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi largely spurned the reformist general who led before her.Instead, he said, \u201cshe has an almost Trump-like characteristic\u201d of distrusting institutions she suspects of loyalty to the previous leader.She removed many officials from the Myanmar Peace Center, for instance, which leads negotiations with the country\u2019s ethnic insurgencies. Soon after, truces collapsed and fighting resurged.A small circle of insiders effectively runs the country, sidestepping formal institutions. The party and the government it runs have been hollowed out.One day this summer, students at an Islamic school compound in Yangon heard shouting from outside the gates. A few dozen Buddhist nationalists were threatening to storm the buildings.They had arrived the day before to demand that local officials close the schools, which were rumored to operate secretly as mosques. If officials did not comply, they said, they would destroy the buildings.Now gathered outside, their threat seemed imminent. The police arrived but refused to intervene, witnesses said, and the students evacuated the buildingU Wai Phyo Aung, the local lawmaker, said that the authorities feared that intervention could turn deadly, as religious tensions in his district had risen to dangerous levels.It was a tacit admission of a nationwide phenomenon: Buddhist extremists hold growing sway over society, at times bending even the state to their will.Buddhists\u2019 influence has grown since 2012, when speech and media restrictions fell away, opening a vacuum that extremists have helped fill. Their message of nationalism and traditionalism has resonated in a society disoriented by rapid changes.U Soe Myint Aung, a political scientist, said officials \u201cknew that it would be too costly for them to stop this Buddhist nationalism.\u201dThe state has long derived its authority from Buddhism. So while it can restrict fringe groups, it cannot take on the clergy more broadly. Instead, it has pursued what Mr. Soe Myint Aung called \u201can experiment in negative control,\u201d tolerating nationalists as long as they target minorities and activists rather than the state.\u201cIf the government is facing a crisis, they use this religion issue,\u201d said U Zaw Win Latt, a senior officer of the Myanmar Islamic Council. \u201cWe are a scapegoat.\u201dThe extremists operate with growing impunity, often targeting Muslims and their businesses.\u201cThe state cannot protect its citizens,\u201d Mr. Zaw Win Latt said.In 2015, the Asian Barometer Survey of 13 Asian countries yielded two striking findings from Myanmar.Over 80 percent said that religious authorities should have a say in lawmaking and that citizenship should be tied to religion. Nearly two-thirds opposed checks on the executive branch. Social controls were seen as necessary and pluralism as dangerous. Nearly all expressed distrust of fellow citizens. \u201cDemocracies plagued by low social trust are prone to conflict,\u201d the scholars wrote, and are \u201cvulnerable to fragmentation.\u201d\u201cMyanmar was never a liberal society,\u201d said Mr. Thant Myint-U, the historian. Decades of army rule, civil war and isolation, he added, \u201chave only deepened illiberal sentiments.\u201dSeven in 10 of those surveyed said students should not question teachers, considered an important metric of authoritarian values.\u201cPeople think Aung San Suu Kyi is a god, she can do anything she wants,\u201d said Ms. Nyo Nyo Thin, the former lawmaker. \u201cThis is our education, that we should follow the leader.\u201dIt looked like a last gasp of the old system when, in 2013, the transitional authorities passed a rule allowing fines or prison terms for journalists who criticize the government. The rule, known as 66(d), was invoked seven times under that government. Five led to charges.Rights groups, though alarmed, believed full democracy would end this. Instead, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government has invoked the rule 89 times, according to the Myanmar Journalism Institute. Thirteen journalists have faced punishment and 20 others await charges. Ten are accused of defaming Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.\u201cWe are on the way to be like Cambodia\u201d \u2014 which has closed media outlets and regressed into authoritarianism \u2014 \u201cor even worse,\u201d said U Sein Win, who teaches journalism at the institute.The greatest threat, he said, is not prosecution but self-censorship. \u201cThey are like bamboo, bending with the wind,\u201d he said of reporters.Several, he said, told him they had played down atrocities against the Rohingya and played up reports of Rohingya militancy, believing it was in the nation\u2019s best interests.U Thet Swe Win, an idealistic and bohemian 31-year-old activist, was once the sort of person thought to define the new Myanmar.Now, he worries that his fellow citizens pose an even greater threat than the state.\u201cWe thought democracy would fall from the sky, that it would just come,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that this is a process that all people have to be involved in.\u201dHe leads the Center for Youth and Social Harmony, one of the few remaining groups promoting religious tolerance.Buddhist groups have stormed his office, accusing him of backing the Rohingya. Rumors spread that the spa he runs with his wife was secretly operated by Muslims, and business dried up. He received threatening phone calls and, for a time, hired guards for his family when he traveled.\u201cI don\u2019t want my kids to live in a society that is divided and hateful,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Critics Scoff as Kremlin Erects Monument to the Repressed", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday called the unveiling of the first Kremlin-promoted monument to the victims of political repression an important step toward preventing oppression in Russia, but critics accused the government of hypocrisy given the continued lack of political rights.\u201cWe and our successors should remember the tragedy of repressions and the reasons that caused them,\u201d Mr. Putin said during the rainy evening ceremony. The memory serves \u201cas a powerful admonition against their repetition.\u201dThe Russian president, who ordered the construction of the monument, the \u201cWall of Sorrow,\u201d three years ago, described political repression as a crime, but stressed that future generations should remember the victims without bringing the country to renewed confrontation by \u201csettling scores.\u201dAbout 40 critics, many of them veterans of the struggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, accused the Kremlin in a petition they released on Facebook of trying to whitewash the present.Among those who signed were famous Soviet-era dissidents, including Aleksandr Podrabinek, Pavel Litvinov and Vladimir Bukovsky, as well as Mustafa Dzhemilev, a longstanding Tatar leader in Crimea who was exiled after opposing Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation.Others, however, called the new monument an important step.\u201cWhen this monument is unveiled by the top figure in the state, being created on behalf of the state,\u201d she said at a news conference before the unveiling, \u201cit will mean our state says: \u2018Terror is a crime. Mass terror, unfair murders of individuals are a crime, and it is bad.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe fact that it is taking place by presidential decree and it is supported by ordinary citizens, who gave money for the monument, indicates to me that this is a new point of reckoning,\u201d Mr. Romanov said.The monument was built on an old parking lot on a prominent crossroads in the center of Moscow, but it is distant from pedestrian traffic. It sits at the end of a street named after Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet nuclear physicist, Nobel laureate and human rights campaigner.The placement of the dark, shadowy bronze sculpture at an ordinary intersection was meant to emphasize that repression could happen anyplace, said Georgy Frangulyan, the artist who spent two years creating it.The central part consists of a curved wall, almost 100 feet long and 20 feet high, made up of what appear to be human figures. The overall shape, Mr. Frangulyan said, represents the grim reaper\u2019s scythe, given that victims were mowed down indiscriminately, while the lack of recognizable faces or figures underscores the victims\u2019 anonymity.The artist said working on the piece continued to haunt him. \u201cIt is very hard to escape this state of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not look for beauty here: It is a state of tragedy.\u201dThe city of Moscow donated much of the approximately $6 million cost, while corporate donors and individuals gave roughly $800,000 more.It is not the first such monument, but it is the first built by presidential decree. A chunk of rock from the Solovki labor camp, the first in what became the national gulag system, sits in front of the Lubyanka Square headquarters of the secret police.In September, at Butovo, an estate near Moscow, a wall bearing the names of about 20,000 victims shot there was opened as part of a memorial garden.Confronting the harrowing legacy of government repression, especially the labor camps, has long been a contentious issue.Those who want a full vetting of the crimes of the past argue that the future will be hobbled without a thorough reckoning. Opponents call the subject too divisive and say it is best forgotten. They include, in particular, members of the Communist Party and a growing number of people who consider the bloody purges under Stalin a necessary if harsh means needed to modernize the country.An estimated 750,000 people were executed during the height of the Great Terror, in 1937 and 1938, but the victims number in the millions when the labor camps, forced collectivization, famine and other horrors are taken into account.Given that the machinery of state repression was run by the ancestor agencies of the Russian security service, the F.S.B., which still controls Russia, historians and others hold out little hope for a thorough examination.The struggle is constant. The administration of the Gulag Museum said it was currently wrestling for control of a building near Lubyanka whose new owner has plans to turn it into a high-end perfume store.In Stalin\u2019s time it was called \u201cThe Shooting House\u201d because more than 31,000 people were sentenced to death there at the height of the terror campaign, according to Mr. Romanov, the museum director.Others point to the persecution of Yuri Dimitriev, a historian who, working for the local chapter of Memorial in the northern region of Karelia, discovered extensive mass graves. He faces child pornography charges over images found on his computer, a not uncommon accusation made in recent years against those the government wants to silence.Some people doubt just how far down memory lane the government wants to go.Sergei Lebedev, a writer whose novel \u201cOblivion\u201d treats the turmoil of a descendant grappling with the legacy of the camps \u2014 both the oppressed and the oppressors \u2014 said he was concerned the Russian government would consider its work done with the monument.It has never opened the archives from the period, and actively fought against Memorial as the group tried to catalog the victims. And it has never acknowledged that some who ran the machinery of repression should bear criminal responsibility.\u201cThe first thing you want from them is to make complete lists, to try to understand the full scale, to name all the names,\u201d Mr. Lebedev said. \u201cThis was never done by the state.\u201dOleg Matsnev and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Chickens Come Home to Roost on Long Island\u2019s North Fork", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe latest newcomers to flock to Eastern Long Island\u2019s North Fork, between Riverhead and Greenport, are not seeking some cutting-edge new vacation spot. They\u2019re year-rounders: grazing sheep, goats and herds of cattle. And they\u2019re changing the character of the area\u2019s farms.The North Fork \u2014 the peninsula between the Peconic Bay and Long Island Sound, long known for acres of undulating farmland \u2014 is taking a step back in a sense, with the introduction of livestock in an area where, since the late 1970s, the farms have grown mostly produce, grapes and nursery stock.But North Fork farmstands that have lately included locally grown shishito peppers and multicolored carrots, along with corn and seasonal stalks of brussels sprouts, are starting to sell their own chickens, eggs and heritage pork.The North Fork is now host to a surprising assortment of creatures being raised for food (and income), largely by a new wave of farmers. There\u2019s even a chef cultivating snails, and he\u2019s finding restaurants nearby and in New York City that are eager to order his crop.He returned to the house and land that his great-grandfather first acquired in order to save a neighboring wooded parcel from development. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t suited for vines, so what else could I do with it?\u201d he said. He decided on cattle. Mr. McCall sells the meat in limited quantities. \u201cYou can make money on cattle,\u201d he said.\u201cOur goal is to make sure the land is used for food production, to protect farming as a business,\u201d said John v.H. Halsey, the trust\u2019s founder and director.\u201cRotating animals and vegetables keeps the soil in good shape,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any chemical fertilizers and you have food for the animals. And diversified crops provide a financial safety net.\u201d (His income also comes from his family\u2019s roofing business.)\u201cWhat was happening was awful,\u201d Ms. Festa said. \u201cBut we realized that change had to come at the grass roots.\u201d After visiting a Virginia farm, Ms. Festa, who had worked in asset management, said she realized they could do it, too. \u201cIt\u2019s gratifying to try to recapture the old ways,\u201d she said. Her husband, still working in Manhattan as an accountant, provides a cushion until the farm can turn a profit.They have converted a former potato barn into a spacious kitchen and store where they sell their own meat products, as well as other goods from nearby farms.Mr. Browder is a fugitive from a 20-year banking career. The Browders sell the poultry and eggs at their farm and at other farmstands, stores and restaurants. The sheep are kept for their wool, which supplies the $250 hand-knit sweaters in their store.She got into farming with a degree in English literature after a stint in the Peace Corps in Mali, where she worked on a farm. She sells some of her birds at the Union Square Greenmarket on Wednesdays. Some of her bobwhite quail, which were once native to the area, are being released into the wild, where they eat ticks.Hal Goodale, who returned 10 years ago to the 40 acres at the eastern edge of Riverhead that had been in his family since the 1800s, is making cheese and raising livestock. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get into farming just to raise cabbages, cauliflower and potatoes like they were doing years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I saw that there was no local meat or dairy.\u201dTroy Gustavson, the former publisher of The Suffolk Times newspaper and an Orient resident for the last 40 years, said the chief objections involve raising pigs on acreage that is part wetland. \u201cIt\u2019s a protected bay area, and we\u2019re concerned about the manure and the runoff,\u201d Mr. Gustavson said. \u201cThis is farmland and they want to farm. We\u2019re not anti-agriculture, but the quality of the groundwater and the bay has to be taken into account.\u201d Some of the wetlands are shellfish breeding grounds.Another issue is what is called agritainment, concerns over crowds and traffic on country roads as the Fresh&co property becomes a tourist attraction with various festivities. On weekends, the North Fork\u2019s roads are already choked with crowds visiting wineries for weddings and other celebrations, not just to sample the latest bottlings.\u201cTheir application did not mention events and festivals, but their website does,\u201d Mr. Gustavson said. Fresh&co has also announced plans to build a 9,000-square-foot barn on the property.The petition opposing the Fresh&co plans has been signed by more than 900 people so far, The Suffolk Times has reported. The Town of Southold Planning Department (which has jurisdiction over Orient) and the State Department of Environmental Conservation are reviewing Fresh&co\u2019s proposal. A spokeswoman for Fresh&co said the company declined to comment.These North Fork farms welcome visitors. Call ahead to check hours and availability of products.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the game birds from Feisty Acres Farms. They are in fact processed by the Browders of Browder\u2019s Birds; they are not taken out of state for processing.Advertisement"}

Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.Walmart took down listings for bump stocks on its website this week.

{"Headline": "Leon Wieseltier Admits \u2018Offenses\u2019 Against Female Colleagues as New Magazine Is Killed", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeon Wieseltier, a prominent editor at The New Republic for three decades who was preparing to unveil a new magazine next week, apologized on Tuesday for \u201coffenses against some of my colleagues in the past\u201d after several women accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate advances.As those allegations came to light, Laurene Powell Jobs, a leading philanthropist whose for-profit organization, Emerson Collective, was backing Mr. Wieseltier\u2019s endeavor, decided to pull the plug on it.\u201cUpon receiving information related to past inappropriate workplace conduct, Emerson Collective ended its business relationship with Leon Wieseltier, including a journal planned for publication under his editorial direction,\u201d the organization said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe production and distribution of the journal has been suspended.\u201dOver the past week, a group of women who once worked at The New Republic had been exchanging emails about their own accounts of Mr. Wieseltier\u2019s behavior in and out of the magazine\u2019s office in Washington, according to one person who has seen the confidential chain and was granted anonymity to describe its contents.Several women on the chain said they were humiliated when Mr. Wieseltier sloppily kissed them on the mouth, sometimes in front of other staff members. Others said he discussed his sex life, once describing the breasts of a former girlfriend in detail. Mr. Wieseltier made passes at female staffers, they said, and pressed them for details about their own sexual encounters.One woman recounted that while she was attempting to fact-check a column Mr. Wieseltier wrote, he forced her to look at a photograph of a nude sculpture in an art book, asking her if she had ever seen a more erotic picture. She wrote that she was shaken and afraid during the incident.Mr. Wieseltier often commented on what women wore to the office, the former staff members said, telling them that their dresses were not tight enough. One woman said he left a note on her desk thanking her for the miniskirt she wore to the office that day. She said she never wore a skirt to the office again.According to the women, male staff members routinely witnessed Mr. Wieseltier\u2019s behavior and did nothing.Mr. Wieseltier did not immediately respond to a request for comment about specific allegations. But in an emailed statement on Tuesday, he offered an apology.\u201cFor my offenses against some of my colleagues in the past I offer a shaken apology and ask for their forgiveness,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe women with whom I worked are smart and good people. I am ashamed to know that I made any of them feel demeaned and disrespected. I assure them I will not waste this reckoning.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. Wieseltier helped lead an exodus from The New Republic, after the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes abruptly fired the magazine\u2019s editor, Franklin Foer, and took the magazine in a more buzzy direction. (In a statement to Politico on Tuesday, Mr. Hughes said he had received complaints in 2014 that Mr. Wieseltier had subjected an employee of the magazine\u2019s office building to unwanted advances and harassment, which he had investigated by outside counsel. \u201cWe directed Mr. Wieseltier to immediately cease any communication with her, and I made sure he knew The New Republic had a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment of any kind,\u201d Mr. Hughes said.)But it was perhaps the now-scuttled new magazine that exemplified both Mr. Wieseltier\u2019s intellectual ambition and the loyal roster of high-powered collaborators he accumulated over the years. Contributors to the first issue consisted of longtime New Republic contributors, including the historian Timothy Snyder, the law professor and former Obama regulations czar Cass Sunstein, the foreign policy writer Robert Kagan and the dance historian Jennifer Homans.\u201cThe model is something like Partisan Review, circa 1955,\u201d he said in an interview last year with the blog of the National Endowment of the Arts.Now, it appears that no one will get to read it. In his statement, Mr. Wieseltier also offered an apology to his current collaborators, including a staff of a half dozen.\u201cI am profoundly sorry to my extraordinary collaborators at the journal we began together that the misdeeds of my past have made it impossible to go forward,\u201d he said. \u201cMy gratitude to them is boundless.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Nigeria and Cameroon, Secessionist Movements Gain Momentum", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut long-simmering tensions over separatist movements in West Africa have also sent huge crowds into the streets and led to deadly government crackdowns and fears of more bloodshed.In Cameroon, 17 people were killed in recent days during protests in English-speaking areas, where some residents have called for splitting off from French-speaking parts of the nation, Amnesty International said.Security forces have been accused of killing protesters in both areas, and neither nation\u2019s government has engaged in meaningful dialogue with residents who want to form their own country.But the harsh responses are only fueling the separatist movements, potentially intensifying calls to break apart the nations, analysts say. \u201cThe excluded are fighting back in the language of exclusion, and it\u2019s not pretty,\u201d said Chidi Odinkalu, a former chairman of the National Human Rights Commission in Nigeria. \u201cThe way out is to run an inclusive country. It\u2019s doable.\u201dHostilities with the central government in Nigeria\u2019s southeast have simmered ever since the Nigerian civil war started 50 years ago, when a self-declared Republic of Biafra tried to break off from the rest of the nation. Tensions have continued in the decades since the rebellion, and picked up momentum this year.As the country wondered about the health of Mr. Buhari, who has spent more than 100 days in London receiving medical treatment for a mystery illness, people poured into the streets in the southeast to support a movement to create a new state or break off into a separate nation, as the area tried to do in the late 1960s.Last month, the military deployed tanks and helicopters in the region. Separatists say that their supporters have been killed and tortured by the military.Troops encircled the home of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and his supporters tried to fight them off with sticks. Reuters reported that bullet holes were found in the house, and that two of its journalists saw six bullet-riddled bodies in the morgue. Separatists said the six people were killed during what they said was a raid by troops on Mr. Kanu\u2019s home. The whereabouts of Mr. Kanu is unknown.Maj. Gen. D. D. Ahmadu, the Nigerian Army\u2019s chief of training and operations, said the military had targeted bandits and other criminals operating in the region, adding that separatists were not being singled out. Yet another military exercise was being planned for the region, raising fears of more violence to come.President Buhari has spoken out harshly against the agitators. In August, he gave a stern warning to those who had \u201ccrossed the national red lines by daring to question our collective existence as a nation.\u201d\u201cNigeria\u2019s unity is settled and not negotiable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shall not allow irresponsible elements to start trouble, and when things get bad they run away and saddle others with the responsibility of bringing back order, if necessary with their blood.\u201d\u201cThis ought to be the preoccupation of the Nigerian Army at this point of our historical annals,\u201d said Sylvester Odion Akhaine, an associate professor of political science at Lagos State University, referring to the other conflicts.Lawyers fed up with new laws that were never translated into English started speaking out. They complained that the government sent judges who could not speak English well to fill their courthouses. They were soon joined by teachers, professors and other citizens who closed shops and schools to protest against a government that they say has failed to live up to its constitutional requirement for a bilingual nation.Protests continued through most of this year. Numerous demonstrators were jailed, and officials shut down the internet. At least two protesters were killed when the security forces fired live ammunition at rallies. Many children in English-speaking regions have not been in school for the past 11 months.Through the months of agitation, and with Cameroonians abroad organizing protests, a small separatist movement began to gain momentum. Its supporters are now calling for a new nation that they want to be called Ambazonia.On Oct. 1, officials sent soldiers and military helicopters to demonstrations in English-speaking regions where protesters were calling for independence. Supporters of Ambazonia hoisted their flags in several villages. The government issued a curfew and travel restrictions.The demonstrations in Cameroon took place on the anniversary of the English-speaking region\u2019s independence more than 50 years ago. For four decades, Cameroon was split into English and French territories. In 1961, the territories then unified into one republic made up mostly of French speakers as well as an English-speaking minority that adhered to British common law. English speakers have long complained that they get fewer resources from the government than their French counterparts do.Mr. Ndi said he had repeatedly called on President Paul Biya to travel to the English-speaking parts of the country to open a dialogue with secessionists. But that has not happened, Mr. Ndi said, though the government did free some leaders of the movement who had been jailed. Protesters say that others are still are being unjustly imprisoned.Mr. Biya, in office since 1982, has made it clear that he does not support any split of the nation. He has been spending time recently in Switzerland, where he often goes for vacations, but on Oct. 1 he released a statement on Facebook calling for peaceful dialogue.Tony Iyare reported from Lagos, and Francois Essomba from Buea, Cameroon.Advertisement"}

Elisa Carri\u00f3, the lawmaker who heads the government coalition\u2019s ticket in the city of Buenos Aires for Sunday\u2019s election, said last week in a televised debate that there was a \u201c20 percent chance\u201d Mr. Maldonado was in Chile. She later apologized.\u201cWe don\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d said Andrea Antico, Mr. Maldonado\u2019s sister-in-law, explaining why she and her husband spent several hours watching the corpse floating in the Chubut River until forensic experts could arrive.The recovery of the body near where Mr. Maldonado had vanished, in an area the family says had already been scoured three times, raised new questions about the investigation. The case has spurred nationwide protests and a social media phenomenon as many Argentines posted Twitter and Facebook messages asking: \u201cWhere is Santiago Maldonado?\u201dMr. Maldonado\u2019s family said they suspected the body had been planted, pointing out that it was upriver from where he was last seen. \u201cI can\u2019t assure it, but I think it was\u201d planted, Sergio Maldonado said.Mr. Maldonado had taken part in a protest in Chubut Province by members of the Mapuche indigenous community, which has long claimed rights to part of territory owned by Benetton, the Italian clothing company.\u201cThis is not the end that we would have preferred,\u201d Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal, the governor of Buenos Aires Province and a close ally of Mr. Macri, said in a radio interview today, referring to the election campaign. \u201cBesides, there is still very little clarity as we wait for the result of the tests that will determine if the body is Santiago\u2019s.\u201dNeither Mr. Macri nor Mrs. Kirchner have commented on the discovery of the body. \u201cMacri\u2019s silence could end up hurting him, particularly when much of the population has always doubted his commitment to human rights issues,\u201d the analyst Mariel Fornoni said.Mr. Macri\u2019s government has said it was giving investigators a chance to do their job. \u201cThe president has been following everything with concern and gave us the order to put everything at the disposal of the courts so it can be cleared up as quickly as possible,\u201d Germ\u00e1n Garavano, the justice and human rights minister, told the state-run news agency T\u00e9lam.Others have criticized the government. Officials\u2019 first reaction \u201cwas to protect the border guards\u201d who broke up the Aug. 1 protest, said Sergio Massa, a candidate in the Buenos Aires senate race.In the weeks before the election, Mrs. Kirchner accused Mr. Macri\u2019s government of trying to distract from the disappearance of Mr. Maldonado by pushing numerous judicial cases against her and her allies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Was Stephen Paddock? The Mystery of a Nondescript \u2018Numbers Guy\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Stephen Paddock was a contradiction: a gambler who took no chances. A man with houses everywhere who did not really live in any of them. Someone who liked the high life of casinos but drove a nondescript minivan and dressed casually, even sloppily, in flip-flops and sweatsuits. He did not use Facebook or Twitter, but spent the past 25 years staring at screens of video poker machines.\u201cI wish I could tell you he was a miserable bastard, that I hate him, that if I could have killed him myself I would have,\u201d said Eric Paddock, a younger brother. \u201cBut I can\u2019t say that. It\u2019s not who he was. We need to find out what happened to him. Something happened to my brother.\u201dThe Las Vegas police believe Mr. Paddock may have had a secret life. He had been buying guns since 1982. But something seemed to change last October. He went on a shopping spree, adding to his arsenal until late last month. One of his purchases, a shotgun, came from Dixie Gunworx in St. George, Utah. Chris Michel, the owner, said Mr. Paddock visited the store three times in January and February, making the 40-minute drive from Mesquite, Nev.Mr. Michel recalled Mr. Paddock saying that he was stopping at a number of local gun dealers, that he had retired and moved to the area, and that he was trying to get back into his hobbies.When it came to guns, Mr. Michel said, \u201che was not a novice.\u201dThe son of a bank robber and a secretary, Mr. Paddock grew up lower middle class in Southern California in the 1960s. From an early age, he focused on gaining complete control over his life and not having to rely on anyone. He cycled through a series of jobs he thought would make him rich, Eric Paddock said.\u201cHe went to work for the I.R.S. because he thought that\u2019s where the money was, but it turned out the money wasn\u2019t there,\u201d the younger Mr. Paddock said. \u201cHe went to the aerospace industry but the money wasn\u2019t there either. He went to real estate and that\u2019s where the money was.\u201dStephen Paddock began buying and refurbishing properties in economically depressed areas around Los Angeles, teaching himself how to put in plumbing and install air-conditioning. By the late 1980s, \u201cwe had cash flow,\u201d said Eric Paddock, who added that he had given his life savings to his older brother to invest and eventually became a partner in his company, because \u201cthat\u2019s the kind of guy he was. I knew he would succeed.\u201d\u201cHe helped make my mother and I affluent enough to be retired in comfort,\u201d he said.With success came a rigidity and uncompromising attitude, along with two failed marriages, both short and childless. Stephen Paddock started gambling. Some who met him described him as arrogant, with a strong sense of superiority. People in his life bent to his will, even his mother and brother. He went out of his way for no one.\u201cHe acted like everybody worked for him and that he was above others,\u201d said John Weinreich, 48, a former executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, where he saw Mr. Paddock frequently from 2012 to 2014. When Mr. Paddock wanted food while he was gambling, he wanted it immediately and would order with more than one server if the meal did not arrive quickly enough.Mr. Weinreich said he would get irritated and \u201cuppity about it.\u201dMr. Paddock was uncompromising but he was also smart.\u201cI would liken him to a chess player: very analytical and a numbers guy,\u201d Mr. Weinreich said. \u201cHe seemed to be working at a higher level mentally than most people I run into in gambling.\u201dMr. Paddock cherished his solitude, his brother said. In 2003, he got his pilot\u2019s license after training in the Los Angeles area, eventually taking the extra step to get an instrument rating so that he could legally fly in cloudy conditions with limited visibility. He bought cookie-cutter houses in Texas and Nevada towns with small airports so that he could park his planes. He was utterly unremarkable.\u201cThis guy paid on time every time and did not cause any problems at any time,\u201d said Lt. Brian Parrish, the spokesman for the Police Department in Mesquite, Tex., where he rented a hangar for $285 a month from 2007 through 2009. He also stored planes at the small airport in Henderson, Nev., from 2002 to 2010, an airport spokesman said, though it is not clear he ever lived at the local addresses to which they had been registered.Even in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways. He remained in control, answerable to no one but himself. He was ensconced in a carpeted hotel suite. He was wearing gloves, as he often did to protect his sensitive skin. He shot himself before the police broke into his room. A piece of paper with numbers written on it lay on a table near his body.\u201cIf Steve decided it was time for Steve to go, Steve got up and left,\u201d Eric Paddock said. \u201cHe did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.\u201dMr. Paddock was the oldest, and least angry, of four boys growing up in the 1950s, said another brother, Patrick Benjamin Paddock II, 60, an engineer in Tucson. Stephen Paddock was born in Iowa, the home state of their mother, Irene Hudson.\u201cMy brother was the most boring one in the family,\u201d Patrick Paddock said. \u201cHe was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it\u2019s like, who?\u201dHis rap sheet was long and included writing bad checks, stealing cars and robbing banks. He was on the F.B.I.\u2019s most wanted list. The agency described him as an avid bridge player, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 245 pounds, who \u201chas been diagnosed as being psychopathic, with possible suicidal tendencies.\u201dStephen Paddock learned resourcefulness and self-reliance from an early age. In 1960, when he was 7, his father went to prison for a series of bank robberies and the family moved to Southern California.The boys\u2019 mother raised them alone on a secretary\u2019s salary, the younger Patrick Paddock said. The brothers would fight over who would get the whole milk. Powdered milk, less tasty but cheaper, was the norm. Their mother never explained where their father was.\u201cShe kept that secret from the family,\u201d Patrick Paddock said.Stephen Paddock graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic Senior High School in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, according to a Los Angeles Unified School District official. Richard Alarcon, a former Los Angeles city councilman, who lived near the Paddocks, said their neighborhood was working class, with a Japanese community center and tidy ranch houses bought with money from the G.I. Bill.Mr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with \u201ca kind of irreverence. He didn\u2019t always stay between the lines.\u201dHe recalled a competition to build a bridge of balsa wood, without staples or glue. Mr. Paddock cheated, he said, using glue and extra wood.\u201cEverybody could see that he had cheated, but he just sort of laughed it off,\u201d Mr. Alarcon said. \u201cHe had that funny quirky smile on his face like he didn\u2019t care. He wanted to have the strongest bridge and he didn\u2019t care what it took.\u201dMr. Paddock spent his 20s and 30s trying to escape the unpredictability of poverty. He worked nights at an airport while going to the California State University, Northridge, his brother Eric said, and then at jobs with the Internal Revenue Service and as an auditor of defense contracts. But it was real estate that ultimately lifted Mr. Paddock to financial freedom.Crucially, they were excellent investments: Stephen Paddock more than doubled his money on his California holdings, which included at least six multifamily residences, according to property records. He made money in Texas, too. In 2012, he sold a 110-unit building in Mesquite, outside Dallas, for $8.3 million.He was a good landlord. He kept the rents low, responded promptly to his tenants\u2019 complaints, learned all their names and made sure they were happy. When one reliable tenant complained about a rent increase, he took half off the difference. He designed the ownership structure so his family would profit and installed his mother in a tidy house just behind the apartment complex in Mesquite, Tex.Mr. Paddock had an apartment in the complex, but he mostly lived elsewhere. He had been married twice, but the apartment looked like a bachelor pad, said Todd Franks, a real estate broker in Dallas. \u201cWhat you would expect from a 25-year-old single guy.\u201dTo Mr. Franks, Mr. Paddock stood out because it was unusual for the landlord of a property that size to pay such close attention to the day-to-day running of his complex.\u201cHe was frustrated by people who did stupid things,\u201d Mr. Franks said.He was also willing to fight to defend what was his. During the riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s, he went to the roof of an apartment complex he owned in a flak jacket and armed with a gun, waiting for the rioters, Mr. Franks said.Though Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually \u2014 Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit \u2014 Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.\u201cHe was a tough negotiator,\u201d Mr. Franks said. \u201cHe wanted his price. His terms. He was a very savvy businessman.\u201dBy the 2000s, with both of his marriages long over, casinos became Mr. Paddock\u2019s habitat. He liked being waited on, seeing shows and eating good food.\u201cHe likes it when people go, \u2018Oh, Mr. Paddock, can I get you a big bowl of the best shrimp anybody had ever eaten on the planet and a big glass of our best port?\u201d Eric Paddock said.Gambling made him feel important, if not social.\u201cYou could tell that being in that high-limit gambling environment would lift him up,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Weinreich, the Atlantis casino host in Reno. \u201cHe liked everyone doting on him.\u201dHe sometimes called for company, inviting his brother Eric and his children for a free weekend in a luxury suite. But mostly he stayed alone.A couple of years ago, Mr. Paddock stayed in one Las Vegas hotel gambling for four months straight, said a gaming industry analyst here who was briefed on Mr. Paddock\u2019s gambling history.The analyst described him as a midlevel high roller, capable of losing $100,000 in one session, which could extend over several days. He said Mr. Paddock may have lost that amount at the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas within the last few months.Playing a slot machine can be mindless and is usually a guaranteed win for the casino. That is not what Mr. Paddock played. His game, video poker, requires some skill. Players have to know the history of a particular machine. They can do that by reading a pay table, which tells them what each possible winning hand pays out.One of the ways that video poker players get an advantage is to play casino promotions, which essentially pay out bonuses to winners, said Richard Munchkin, author of \u201cGambling Wizards: Conversations With the World\u2019s Greatest Gamblers.\u201d A gambler like Mr. Paddock will often \u201clock\u201d a machine, meaning he or she monopolizes it and makes sure no one else uses it during a gambling session.For one casino promotion, Mr. Paddock showed up two hours early, locked two machines and played them for 14 hours straight, Mr. Munchkin said, based on information he had compiled from other gamblers who were there at the time. The promotion lasted 12 hours, he said, \u201cbut he wanted to play for two hours before anybody got those machines. He knew they were the best machines based on pay tables.\u201dMr. Paddock \u201cknew the house advantage down to a tenth of a percent,\u201d he said.As for the mystery of why Mr. Paddock would go on a shooting rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and then kill himself, most in the gambling industry do not believe it had anything to do with money.He was in good standing with MGM Properties, the owner of the Mandalay and the Bellagio, according to a person familiar with his gambling history. He had a $100,000 credit limit, the person said, but never used the full amount.Mr. Paddock spent so much time in casinos that he was mostly a ghost in the neighborhoods where he had homes.Colleen Maas, a neighbor of Mr. Paddock\u2019s in Reno, said she had not seen him once in a year and a half, despite walking her dog three times a day and going to line dancing events with his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, at the community center.He did travel. On his 60th birthday, April 9, 2013, he flew to the Philippines on Japan Airlines and stayed for five days, according to a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The family of Ms. Danley, his girlfriend, lived there and she was visiting the country at the time. The couple went again for his birthday the following year.When he did appear at his Reno home, he could be curt. Another neighbor, John McKay, recalled a day when he was hanging Christmas lights on a railing in his front yard when Mr. Paddock walked by. Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Mr. Paddock kept walking. \u201cHe said nothing,\u201d Mr. McKay said. \u201cNot a word. No eye contact.\u201dEven more baffling, when Mr. McKay tried to strike up a conversation with Mr. Paddock about Donald Trump during the election campaign, he got no response.\u201cAlmost everyone has a reaction to Trump,\u201d said Mr. McKay\u2019s wife, Darlene.Ms. McKay said that she would usually get up early each morning to watch the sunrise and, when Mr. Paddock was at his home, she would see him dressed in his gym clothes walking to the community center for a workout. Ms. McKay recalled something peculiar: \u201cHe always walked across the street and would never pass in front of our house.\u201dMr. McKay said that he rarely saw a window or a door open at the house. One day he saw Mr. Paddock\u2019s garage door open, and noticed a large safe inside.It is not clear what set Mr. Paddock on his path to destruction. As early as 2010, he could no longer fly his planes. His medical certificate expired, according to Federal Aviation Administration records, and there are no indications that he renewed it.Mr. Paddock bought his last house in Mesquite, Nev., a retirement community of 18,000 people about 90 minutes from Las Vegas that attracts golfers and gamblers from around the country. He seems to have paid in cash, according to property records, and, as he did with other houses, spent very little time there.His neighbors added personal touches to their yards \u2014 decorative pots, plants of all colors and sizes. Mr. Paddock\u2019s house was unadorned. One of the few things neighbors remembered about him was the solid-panel fence he erected. The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen. On Thursday, investigators had left. A tiny paint-splattered easel, its brush drawer open and empty, stood in the back yard.Ms. Danley worked in Mesquite. She took a job booking sports bets at a local casino called the Virgin River, where gamblers sat together in rows watching horse races and waitresses circled in tight black skirts.Several days a week, she attended morning mass at a local Catholic church, said Leo McGinty, 80, a fellow parishioner who knew her from the casino.Ms. Danley dressed smartly and modestly, he said. She usually sat alone.Reporting was contributed by Stephanie Saul, Vivian Yee and Susan Beachy from New York; Adam Goldman from Washington; Kitty Bennett from St. Petersburg, Fla.; Miriam Jordan from Los Angeles; Sheryl Kornman from Tucson; and Richard C.

{"Headline": "California Today: A Giant Dilemma: Is It Possible to Root for the Dodgers?", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, a reporter based in the Bay Area.The San Francisco Giants were tied for the worst record in baseball this year, so their fans are free agents for the baseball playoffs. I\u2019m a die-hard Giants fan, and this year I\u2019m thinking about doing the unthinkable: rooting for the Dodgers.The Giants/Dodgers rivalry is as old as baseball. Its roots stretch back to the 1850s and officially began in New York in 1890. In years when the Giants don\u2019t make the playoffs, fans are supposed to adhere to a policy whereby they can root for any team they like, so long as they root against the Dodgers.Let\u2019s go through some of the non-Dodger options. In the National League we have the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Chicago Cubs, and the Washington Nationals. In the American League we have the Houston Astros, the Cleveland Indians, the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees.Ever since 1958, when the Giants and Dodgers moved west, the teams have become a proxy for the NorCal/SoCal rivalry. And today, with Hollywood moving toward Silicon Valley and Silicon Valley moving toward Hollywood, the rivalry just doesn\u2019t seem all that epic anymore.\u201cI think it\u2019s still there, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anywhere like it was in the 80s,\u201d said Andrew Goldblatt, author of \u201cThe Giants and the Dodgers: Four Cities, Two Teams, One Rivalry. \u201cPolitically and economically, L.A. and San Francisco have a lot more in common with each other than they do with the rest of the country.\u201dAccording to the Census Bureau, about 15,000 people move from L.A. to San Francisco each year, and about 17,000 move from San Francisco to L.A. Californians go back and forth, so tonight I\u2019m going to turn on the T.V. and see if my allegiance can do the same.If only for a few weeks.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)On a March night 89 years ago, the St. Francis Dam buckled in a remote canyon north of Los Angeles.The breach let loose a wall of water that barreled through the towns of Piru, Fillmore, and Santa Paula on a 54-mile trip to the Pacific, leveling homes and killing more than 400 people.The St. Francis catastrophe stands as one the most searing tragedies in California history.Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein introduced the bill on Thursday after it won approval in the House.\u201cThe dam\u2019s collapse had an impact on the entire nation, with news of the tragedy appearing in newspapers as far away as Maine,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said in a statement.The senators said the memorial would serve an additional purpose: As a reminder of the dangers of deficient infrastructure.St. Francis was a wake-up call that ushered in higher standards of dam building.But expertise only goes so far in the course of rearranging nature.\u201cWhen you build a dam, you are playing God,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s tough to be God.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital on the Paradox of Ego and Humility", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeQ. What were your early years like?But after my dad lost his job, he was unemployed for a long time, and there was a lot of drinking and stuff like that. My mom worked nights, and she was a housekeeper and then became a nurse\u2019s aide. We had this 400-square-foot two-bedroom apartment above a laundromat. They had to grind every month to make ends meet.What were you doing outside of class?I worked a lot. My first job was at a Burger King. I then got a job through a government program to do data entry. They told me there was so much to do that I probably wasn\u2019t going to get it all done in the summer.But I became obsessed with getting it all done. The same thing happened with another job in high school. The manager told me that I probably wouldn\u2019t get it all done, but that if I did, he would take me to McDonald\u2019s and buy me as much as I wanted.I did all the work, we went to McDonald\u2019s, and I ate six Big Macs. He was flabbergasted. I don\u2019t know how I was able to eat six, quite honestly. I think I trained myself from when I worked at Burger King.What else were you involved in during high school?I loved gambling, and I loved card games. I would run a little blackjack game at one of the lunch tables. The kids could bet 25 cents to a dollar.I was the house. I was making $40 or $50 each lunch hour, and it was all the money in the world. On the weekends, I would take that money and sneak into the charity casinos with my fake ID.That showed me that I have a passion for risk, and that I really like decision-making under pressure. I still play a lot high-stakes poker.Any thoughts on where that passion for risk comes from?I\u2019ve found that a lot of successful poker players grew up poor. And I\u2019m convinced that poor people have a risk tolerance that rich people don\u2019t have because poor people fundamentally don\u2019t value money that much because they\u2019re used to not having it.With rich people, when they\u2019re born rich, a lot of their identity is wrapped up in that because of the way society defines your success by the money you have. So they covet money. I\u2019ve never cared about it that much.How have your parents influenced your leadership style?In both good and bad ways. The bad part is that I\u2019m argumentative like my father. I find that a lot of really important decisions in business are sometimes made on faulty premises, so I like to challenge people to go back to first principles on their assumptions.The good part is that I am pretty introspective and humble enough to constantly change my mind, like both my father and my mother.Those traits can be really productive together, but if they\u2019re not well balanced, they can be unproductive. So my constant challenge is to surround myself with people who have the nerve to stand up to me and argue.Any lessons from your early management experiences?I was pretty good at managing early on because I learned how to get to know people and how to understand their motivations. I never allowed myself to just take at face value who they are or how they presented themselves.Part of it was also just the general curiosity that I had about people. I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends growing up, and suddenly I had a context to meet interesting people and ask them about their story. You can disarm people just by saying, \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201dYou left a big job at Facebook to start your fund in 2011.I got exceptionally lucky, so I have nothing to complain about. But other people would have looked at the money I was leaving on the table, and they would have made a decision to stay. It was an enormous amount, but it just didn\u2019t matter.It\u2019s about going back to first principles. What do I value? I valued my independence, I valued my creativity, and I also valued winning over the long term. I decided to make a big bet on myself.And what do you look for when you\u2019re making bets on the people you invest in?I look for a couple of threads. One is the combination of ego and humility. Let\u2019s be honest, a lot of C.E.O.s are ego-driven people. But they also have to be humble in some very precise ways around ideas and decisions, and being able to change their mind. That\u2019s an idiosyncratic combination.Another thread is intellectual curiosity. They ask a lot of \u201cwhy\u201d questions, and they\u2019re comfortable with the ambiguous nature of things that are unknown.The last one is that you want somebody who\u2019s ultra-resilient, because there are just so many trials and tribulations to building a business. One day it can feel like you\u2019re on the top of the world, and the next day it\u2019s all crumbling down. Can you compartmentalize it, put it in context and enjoy it?What career and life advice do you give to new college grads?You have to put yourself in a position to learn. And when you\u2019re young, you only learn when things aren\u2019t working. The problem is that you\u2019re never told to go to something that\u2019s not working. You\u2019re only ever told to jump on a rocket ship.There\u2019s a point in time for that, but if you want to be really good at your craft, it only comes through knowledge, and knowledge only comes through experience, and experience only comes through failure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politicians Are Bad at Podcasting", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThese days, it seems that everybody\u2019s got a podcast, even members of Congress.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Sean Duffy of Wisconsin debuted their own podcasts this month, joining audio series begun earlier this year from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago.The concept is a no-brainer: satisfy Americans\u2019 seemingly insatiable thirst for political analysis from ready-made political stars with inside perspectives. And from the elected officials\u2019 perspective, the appeal is obvious. They can sidestep media gatekeepers and beam their personalities and priorities straight to their constituents\u2019 ears, all while heightening their national brands, perhaps in anticipation of seeking higher office. It\u2019s less clear what the constituents get out of the deal.On their podcasts, our representatives are doing something almost journalistic: They\u2019re moderating discussions with other political figures, interviewing experts on North Korea or monopoly power and staging interactions with the public. Except there are no actual journalists around to ask any pesky questions. At least on TV interview shows or at news conferences, reporters challenge the politician\u2019s narrative. Even on Twitter, we can tweet back.Excepting Mr. Duffy, this is largely a Democratic phenomenon, and not because people who listen to podcasts are more liberal. Podcast listeners are only a little more left-leaning than America at large: According to Edison Research, 27 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, compared with 24 percent of adult podcast listeners. And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven. But that\u2019s not the only thing wrong with it. The podcasts are also boring.Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them. Mr. Emanuel\u2019s podcast would probably be more captivating if he weren\u2019t so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill. And I\u2019m sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what it\u2019s like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but he\u2019s instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.Part of the problem is that for lawmakers, podcasting is obviously a side gig. In the first episode of \u201cCanarycast,\u201d Mr. Brown tells his guests \u2014 a trio of Whirlpool workers \u2014 that he has to end the interview to cast a vote. Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes. I guess she\u2019s been busy.The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office. These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain. They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs. For lawmakers, the podcast is rarely undertaken in the legitimate pursuit of good content but is instead a dull, modern version of constituent outreach. These shows are an attempt to signal that they are listening to us. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we should listen to them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boy Scouts Will Accept Girls, in Bid to \u2018Shape the Next Generation of Leaders\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Boy Scouts of America announced plans on Wednesday to broadly accept girls, marking a historic shift for the century-old organization and setting off a debate about where girls better learn how to be leaders.The Boy Scouts, which has seen dwindling membership numbers in recent decades, said that its programs could nurture girls as well as boys, and that the switch would make life easier for busy parents, who might prefer to shuttle children to a single organization regardless of gender.\u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing that develops leadership skills and discipline like this organization,\u201d said Randall Stephenson, the group\u2019s national board chairman. \u201cIt is time to make these outstanding leadership development programs available to girls.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve had 105 years of supporting girls and a girl-only safe space,\u201d said Lisa Margosian, chief customer officer for the Girl Scouts, who added that the organization felt \u201cblindsided\u201d by the announcement. \u201cSo much of a girl\u2019s life is a life where she is in a coed environment, and we have so much research and data that suggests that girls really thrive in an environment where they can experiment, take risk and stretch themselves in the company of other girls.\u201dFor families involved in scouting, the announcement led to a scramble of questioning phone calls and frantic Facebook discussions as parents and scout leaders wrestled with tentative plans for the transition. Next year, girls will be allowed into the Cub Scouts program, which had been limited to young boys. A program for older girls is expected to be available in 2019, giving them a path to earn the prestigious rank of Eagle Scout.The Boy Scouts has offered girls limited access to some programs before, but it has never before welcomed them into its core Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts programs. And the introduction of girls still does not mean that Boy Scouts\u2019 gatherings will necessarily include both genders. The smallest groups of Cub Scouts will continue to be single sex.Michael Ver Duin, a third-generation Eagle Scout and troop leader in Grand Haven, Mich., said he was \u201csuper excited\u201d for the change \u2014 an opportunity, in his view, for girls to have the same choices as boys.\u201cThe closest I\u2019ve had to a negative comment is \u2018I know there will be some who do not welcome this,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThe two biggest things I see as a challenge to explain to parents are, \u2018What kind of problems are you going to have if you had boys and girls on the same camping outing?\u2019 and \u2018Do boys need time to be boys and girls need time to be girls?\u2019 \u201dOthers were deeply skeptical. Joseph Carballo, 70, has been with the Boy Scouts for 30 years, most of that time as a scoutmaster of Troop 65, in the Bronx. His two sons, both Eagle Scouts and now in their 30s and 40s, have been with the organization since the 1990s. \u201cAnd we all have the same view: no girls,\u201d he said.\u201cBoys and girls should have separate organizations for activities,\u201d Mr. Carballo explained, as his troops entered the cafeteria of St. Helena\u2019s Church for their Wednesday night meeting. \u201cThere is an organization for girls. It\u2019s called the Girl Scouts.\u201d (His granddaughter, he pointed out, is a member.)For the Boy Scouts, the change is also a chance to boost its sagging membership. The group says it has 2.3 million members between the ages of 7 and 21 and nearly a million volunteers throughout the United States and its territories. At its peak in the 1970s, the organization, incorporated in 1910, was closer to five million members.In April, the Boy Scouts began exploring the possibility of opening more widely to girls after receiving inquiries from its members, a spokeswoman for the Boy Scouts, Effie Delimarkos, said. She said the group collected input from families over the summer and, on Wednesday, its directors unanimously voted to allow the expansion.For some parents, the announcement came as an answer to longstanding complaints that offerings by the Girl Scouts were lacking, particularly for girls with less traditionally feminine interests.\u201cThe problem with the Girl Scout curriculum is that it\u2019s very focused on who your leader is for your particular troop,\u201d said Rebecca Szetela, a mother of four from Canton, Mich. \u201cIf you have a mom who\u2019s really into crafts and girlie stuff and being a princess, then that\u2019s what your Girl Scout troop is going to be like. If you have a daughter who\u2019s more rough and tumble, it\u2019s not going to be a good fit.\u201dSome girls, like Ella Jacobs, 12, of Sebastopol, Calif., have long argued for the chance to be allowed into the Boy Scouts.\u201cMy point has always been that there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with the Girl Scouts, but they weren\u2019t the right fit for our family,\u201d said her mother, Danelle Jacobs, a lawyer. \u201cGirls should have the choice.\u201dBrian Seeton, a scoutmaster in Canton, Ohio, predicted that the acceptance of girls would play out much like the acceptance of gay Scouts and leaders. \u201cParents and kids didn\u2019t care one way or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll only be an issue for the first couple of years and then it\u2019ll carry on as it always was.\u201dBryan Spellman, a scoutmaster in Fishers, Ind., pointed out that there already were girls in some scouting programs, and that while the announcement was somewhat sudden, it would ultimately work out.\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t mind it at all,\u201d Mr. Spellman said. \u201cI think Scouting is one of the greatest youth organizations that we have in this nation.

{"Headline": "Happiness Is Other People", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIn a particularly low moment a few years back, after arriving friendless and lonely from Britain to live in the United States, I downloaded a \u201chappiness app\u201d onto my phone. It was surprisingly hard to choose one. There were close to a thousand bliss-promising options in the app store \u2014 ones that would teach you to meditate or be grateful, or that would send you photomontages of sunsets and puppies or unfeasibly flattering shots of your loved ones (giving you a moment to temporarily ignore your actual, less attractive loved ones.)The app I eventually chose messaged me every hour or so with a positive affirmation that I was supposed to repeat to myself over and over. \u201cI am beautiful,\u201d or \u201cI am enough.\u201d The problem was, every time my phone buzzed with an incoming message, I would get a Pavlovian jolt of excitement thinking an actual person was trying to contact me. \u201cI am enough,\u201d I would snarl bitterly upon realizing the truth, unable to shake the feeling that, without friends or community, I really wasn\u2019t.\u201cHappiness comes from within,\u201d said the inspirational photo-card in my Facebook news feed a few days later, the loopy white meme-font set against a backdrop of a woman contorted into a yoga pose so tortuous it looked as though she might actually be investigating her own innards trying to locate her bliss.Having spent the last few years researching and writing a book about happiness and anxiety in America, I\u2019ve noticed that this particular strain of happiness advice \u2014 the kind that pitches the search for contentment as an internal, personal quest, divorced from other people \u2014 has become increasingly common. Variations include \u201cHappiness is determined not by what\u2019s happening around you, but what\u2019s happening inside you\u201d; \u201cHappiness should not depend on other people\u201d; and the perky and socially shareable \u201cHappiness is an inside job.\u201d One email I received from a self-help mailing list even doubled down on the idea with the turbocharged word mash-up \u201cwithinwards,\u201d (although when the subject heading \u201cGo Withinwards\u201d landed in my inbox I briefly thought it was an ad for a nose-to-tail offal restaurant.)In an individualistic culture powered by self-actualization, the idea that happiness should be engineered from the inside out, rather than the outside in, is slowly taking on the status of a default truism. This is happiness framed as journey of self-discovery, rather than the natural byproduct of engaging with the world; a happiness that stresses emotional independence rather than interdependence; one based on the idea that meaningful contentment can be found only by a full exploration of the self, a deep dive into our innermost souls and the intricacies and tripwires of our own personalities. Step 1: Find Yourself. Step 2: Be Yourself.But while placing more and more emphasis on seeking happiness within, Americans in general are spending less and less time actually connecting with other people. Nearly half of all meals eaten in this country are now eaten alone. Teenagers and young millennials are spending less time just \u201changing out\u201d with their friends than any generation in recent history, replacing real-world interaction with smartphones.Self-reflection, introspection and some degree of solitude are important parts of a psychologically healthy life. But somewhere along the line we seem to have gotten the balance wrong. Because far from confirming our insistence that \u201chappiness comes from within,\u201d a wide body of research tells us almost the exact opposite.Study after study shows that good social relationships are the strongest, most consistent predictor there is of a happy life, even going so far as to call them a \u201cnecessary condition for happiness,\u201d meaning that humans can\u2019t actually be happy without them. This is a finding that cuts across race, age, gender, income and social class so overwhelmingly that it dwarfs any other factor.What\u2019s more, neglecting our social relationships is actually shockingly dangerous to our health. Research shows that a lack of social connection carries with it a risk of premature death comparable to that of smoking, and is roughly twice as dangerous to our health as obesity. The most significant thing we can do for our well-being is not to \u201cfind ourselves\u201d or \u201cgo within.\u201d It\u2019s to invest as much time and effort as we can into nurturing the relationships we have with the people in our lives.Given all that, the next time you have the choice between meditating and sitting in a bar with your friends complaining about meditation class, you should probably seriously consider going to the bar, no matter what your happiness app says.Ruth Whippman is the author of \u201cAmerica the Anxious: How Our Pursuit of Happiness Is Creating a Nation of Nervous Wrecks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No storm can take that away from you.\u201dTwo weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, a measure of life has returned to its 494-year-old capital city. But it is a life far from normal. The eight-hour waits for gas in the days just after the storm are now typically just a few minutes. But business and commerce remain disrupted, many residents are still living without power or running water, and obtaining necessities often requires plugging into the ancient internet of \u201ccuchicheo\u201d \u2014 the buzz on the street.For those who know Havana, it feels Havana-esque. Word spreads of a strong Wi-Fi signal in the lobby of this-or-that hotel. Word spreads of a supermarket with ice. Word of a black-market hustler selling the precious diesel needed to run electric generators.Ask a chef how he obtained fresh vegetables, and he is likely to reply, \u201cConnections.\u201dInstant gratification, the norm in a city largely inured to mainland efficiency, has been replaced by the art of the wait. On Monday night, about two dozen people were camped out next to a SuperMax supermarket, their faces slicked with sweat. An ice machine there was producing two bags\u2019 worth, every half-hour. Many in the line said they had been waiting three hours or more.An elderly man\u2019s turn came, and he stood before the machine, swiveling his hips in celebration as the precious stuff cluttered into the bag in his outstretched arms.\u201cYou have to wait for everything,\u201d said Andrews Szorenyi, 50, a videographer observing the proceedings who added that he grew up in communist Hungary. \u201cI feel I am in the Budapest of that era.\u201dMr. Szorenyi said he had come to the supermarket, which was running on a generator, mostly to enjoy its air-conditioning for a while.But it is not surprising that some of the first semblances of normalcy have returned earliest to San Juan, a city of 395,000 and the island\u2019s cultural, political and economic heart. After the storm, the commonwealth government imposed a dry law forbidding the sale of alcohol. It was lifted Friday to the great relief of many. A strict curfew has been creeping up in recent days, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., and then, on Wednesday, to midnight.In the capital, the lifting of the dry law, or \u201cley seca,\u201d sparked the return of a time-honored tradition of hanging out, beer in hand, in front of the city\u2019s 24-hour convenience stores.Ivan P\u00e9rez, 42, a chef, was finishing off a Heineken on a darker-than-normal street corner in the fashionable Condado neighborhood, surrounded by a young, hip casual crowd. Staying home was not a particularly pleasant option, he said: he had no electricity at his apartment, and no generator. Then again, curfew was approaching soon, and he would have no choice but to go home.Mr. P\u00e9rez, like others interviewed while socializing on the broken island, said he felt a certain guilt for enjoying a frivolous moment of leisure. But he, too, was a victim. His restaurant was among those finally up and running \u2014 with a limited menu \u2014 but he had gone over a week without a paycheck, and he was worried about his mortgage payment.\u201cI would like to help everyone on the island if I could do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have to work.\u201dBetter to be outside than in a sweltering apartment. And so, the joggers returned to their morning runs along La Laguna Del Condado, and the surfers have returned to La Ocho \u2014 so named for the No. 8 bus stop nearby \u2014 to carve up its famous wave. All while other San Juaneros, in sections of neighborhoods like fashionable Ocean Park and working class Barriada Figueroa, were heaping soggy, ruined furniture into piles and pulling felled trees off roofs.Some private schools are already up and running, but Puerto Rico\u2019s public schools are tentatively set to open on Oct. 16, leaving many who have work to return to scrambling for creative child care options. For now, broader concerns about earning a living extend across classes, from lawyers eager to bill hours to Josue Ruiz, 37, a hairstylist whose barbershop was destroyed in the storm.On Tuesday morning, Mr. Ruiz was at La Ocho, eating dried cornflakes for breakfast and letting his two little girls run within sight of the waves. To keep his business going, Mr. Ruiz said, he had posted a note on his Facebook page offering home visits, along with the message \u201cDon\u2019t be hairy.\u201d His daily appointments began at 2 p.m.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to live with it,\u201d he said of his changed circumstances.For the time being, this spirit of improvisation \u2014 and the jarring juxtaposition of quasi-normalcy and anything but \u2014 are providing San Juan with a new post-storm flavor that will probably define it in the coming months. Next to the gleaming, elegant convention center \u2014 the nerve center of the recovery effort \u2014 the Sheraton Hotel casino is doing good business, full of gamblers, cocktail drinkers and warbling karaoke-style singing.The lobby is packed with locals who heard about the two hours of free internet. Their noses tend to be buried in their devices, as they go in search of crucial information \u2014 or a brief escape.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a lifestyle. And now, it\u2019s a marketing tool.The tiny house, which captured the public\u2019s fascination in books like \u201cThe Not So Big House,\u201d by Sarah Susanka, and TV series like \u201cTiny House Nation,\u201d is catching the attention of corporate America and entrepreneurs nationwide. Businesses are piggybacking off the trend, wooing customers and solidifying their brands.\u201dIt\u2019s still a market in its nascent stage,\u201d said Dan Dobrowolski, owner of Escape Traveler, a designer and builder of tiny homes in Rice Lake, Wis. \u201cIt has not by any means matured.\u201dIn December, the developer of Mountainside at Northstar in Lake Tahoe, Calif., unveiled Rendezvous Cabins, a set of three 400-square-foot homes to be used as perks for residents, said Ron Barnes, senior strategist for the developer, Mountainside Partners.\u201cI wanted to create an experiential community where people discover paths and get to know nature a little more,\u201d Mr. Barnes said. Mountainside homeowners can book them for free for any number of purposes, such as parties, sleepovers or lodging for visitors.Two of the tiny cabins feature a porch with Adirondack chairs, floor-to-ceiling windows, a leather couch, a kitchen, a bathroom and a king-size bed. The third building is set up more as a living room and meeting hub. To encourage people to disconnect from digital distractions, the units are not equipped with televisions or Wi-Fi, Mr. Barnes said.Mountainside promotes the Rendezvous Cabins in its marketing strategy; prospective buyers of homes in the development can spend a night in a tiny house or model home to experience the neighborhood. The plan seems to be working: About 90 percent of the visitors become buyers after experiencing a weekend there.\u201cEveryone is having a great time staying in them,\u201d Mr. Barnes said.Tiny houses are also used to help companies bolster their presence on social media sites like Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.This summer, Hormel, the maker of Spam, sponsored a Tiny House of Sizzle Tour with an ornate unit painted in blue and yellow. The home on wheels made stops at festivals, malls and ballparks, where company representatives handed out samples as people took pictures inside and marveled at the Spam souvenirs.\u201cThe tiny house idea is definitely on trend right now,\u201d said Brian Lillis, the Spam brand manager. \u201cWe are in the process of getting our social media numbers, but I am sure we tracked well.\u201dUntuckit, a New York apparel retailer that specializes in untucked shirts, hauled a tiny house that resembled one of its stores throughout the East Coast in 2016, stopping at universities and in small towns. The aim was to expose Untuckit to more consumers and determine where to open locations, said the company\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, Chris Riccobono.\u201cIf we sold shirts, that was a bonus,\u201d he said.Driving the mini-boutique around was like having a moving billboard, Mr. Riccobono said, and the payoff in social media presence justified the $40,000 investment. The campaign was so successful that the company is planning a second one for 2018.TheSize Surfaces, a composite-stone manufacturer in Castell\u00f3n, Spain, also ran a tiny-house tour to showcase a 400-square-foot dwelling clad with Neolith, the company\u2019s stain-proof synthetic surface. The promotional journey started in January in Orlando, Fla., and will continue across the United States throughout the year. The company\u2019s aim is to prove that Neolith can be applied on floors, walls, countertops, even exterior siding.\u201cWe believe that anywhere where there\u2019s a surface, you can cover with Neolith,\u201d said Saudia Utter, marketing manager at FM Distributing, a Neolith provider in San Francisco.In this tiny house with mansion features, a ladder leads up to an outdoor deck outfitted with a gas barbecue. Inside, the house features a loft bed, two bathrooms with Toto toilets, a kitchen with a tall wine refrigerator, recycling bins, a built-in espresso machine, Miele appliances and a living room with a flat-screen TV and an electric fireplace. A marblelike dining table cut of Neolith stands as the focal point of the kitchen.\u201cEveryone who has seen it has been impressed, and it is bigger than everyone imagined it to be,\u201d said Ms. Utter, whose company hosted the model house for two months. \u201cWe were surprised by the fact it has been on the road all year and nothing has been cracked or broken. It has stayed in immaculate condition.\u201dTiny homes are gaining traction as rental lodging, too. Across the United States, mini-hotels are springing up in R.V. parks and resorts and on private lots. Over the next five years, \u201cwe are going to see whole communities and tiny house hotels all over the place,\u201d said Jamie Mackay, the founder and chief executive of Wheelhaus, a maker of modular homes in Jackson, Wyo.Mr. Mackay also runs the nearby Fireside Resort, which features 25 tiny homes that he designed. After guests asked repeatedly where they could buy one of the units, he started Wheelhaus to sell his houses.The Snake River Sporting Club, a 1,000-acre private club in Jackson, ordered a neighborhood of four one-bedroom tiny houses it calls Discovery Village. Lavished with Restoration Hardware furniture and accessories, the units can be booked for $225 to $525 nightly.And tiny houses offer a humanitarian benefit. In the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, urban planning coordinators are looking to them as transitional housing that neighborhoods will see as an asset rather than a blight.Mr. Dobrowolski of Escape Traveler said his company was in Houston helping hurricane-displaced residents with specially designed units. He has developed a lower-cost version of his Escape tiny homes that can be deployed quickly in a disaster.Mr. Mackay of Wheelhaus recently announced Omni-Haus, a transportable structure that, when installed, can withstand winds of 190 miles per hour, he said. Working with local developers in hurricane-ravaged cities, his company is planning to deploy 100 to 200 units to Florida for hurricane survivors.\u201cCheap emergency housing is a Band-Aid,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to deliver units that are built to last, not thrown in the landfill later on.

Culinary School Will Teach Instagram Skills", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd if you wonder why your Instagram shots of Martina\u2019s pies look so good, credit the lighting system, which allows the staff to adjust bulbs individually, with \u201ca warmer hue in the dining room than in the kitchen,\u201d Mr. Anderer said, \u201cso it doesn\u2019t cast too much shade against the pizza.\u201dThe classes will teach students how to work with digital cameras and lighting, how to compose and edit a shot, and how to cook for the still camera, \u201cwith the same values as if you were eating it, evoking the feeling that it\u2019s going to be luscious,\u201d said Kersti Bowser, a food stylist and institute alumna who is working to develop the courses with Phil Mansfield, a staff photographer at the school.They hope to replace the excess they see on social media, with photos that communicate flavor. Ms. Bowser thinks people are becoming \u201cnumb to the shock value\u201d of much of what they see. \u201cIt seems so fabulous, much of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI want food to keep its integrity.\u201dStudents may start out with the same raw ingredients they use in cooking class, but the rules are different in the photo class: They may want to undercook chicken or fish to keep the skin from looking tired, and vegetables may be burned on purpose to better convey texture.A photogenic dish, Mr. Potanovich said, is \u201cabsolutely\u201d likelier to stay on the menu.But there\u2019s another reason for the new classes: The goal of becoming a restaurant chef and owner is increasingly elusive, thanks to competition for top jobs and a stagnant restaurant market. So schools like the culinary institute hope to prepare their students for a broader range of careers. In the current job market, an expanded skill set can make the difference between being employed and still looking.\u201cWe see a small but steady increased interest in careers specifically in beverages and wine, food education, nutrition and wellness, food media,\u201d said Denise Bauer, dean of the institute\u2019s three-year-old School of Liberal Arts and Food Studies. Students \u201cwant to prepare for a food career that might not focus on food service alone,\u201d she said, but could also involve the creation of photos for a variety of businesses, from restaurants to media outlets to cookbooks.Mr. Mansfield stressed that the photo and styling classes would not be Instagram-for-credit; real food photography requires many more skills and thoughtful judgment calls. The photographer has to decide how to position a pot of ratatouille in a shot, what bowls and utensils to use and which napkin evokes a rustic feel.In one recent class-development session in the school\u2019s photography studio, Mr. Mansfield tried a test shot, checked his computer monitor, adjusted the lighting equipment, tried again and still wasn\u2019t satisfied. Ms. Bowser moved in with tweezers to rearrange some of the vegetables \u2014 which she had cooked one ingredient at a time, rather than as a stew, to get them ready for their close-up.Make the food photos on your Instagram feed more enticing, with tips for lighting, framing and honing your style.\u201cOur students have coined the term \u2018plate-y,\u2019 as in, \u2018I\u2019m taking a plate-y,\u2019\u201d said Susan Marshall, interim dean of the university\u2019s College of Culinary Arts. \u201cThey\u2019re proud of their work and want to share it,\u201d which they do on the school\u2019s multiple Instagram and Facebook accounts. Students can take an elective food-photography course through three other colleges within the university.But for the die-hards who intend to open restaurants, mastering images is imperative \u2014 even if the definition of mastery is a moving target.Mr. Gonzalez admits to being tired of the Instagram photo feed because, he said, \u201cjust food can get boring.\u201d He thinks that the key to his restaurant\u2019s survival is the Instagram Story, either photo or video, that disappears after 24 hours and encourages people to take a look more often.He uses the feed like a bulletin board, to announce daily specials and events, but he also relies on the stories to provide a \u201cvisual cue\u201d about Lalito\u2019s personality by showing the scene inside the restaurant.\u201cThe stories are not \u2018here\u2019s how to plate a dish,\u2019 but \u2018the people here are amazing,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that photography drives traffic, but I\u2019m interested in having people feel part of something.

In a Senate building, lawmakers and their aides attended policy panels on how Amazon manages privacy on its Echo devices and how sales for small businesses are booming on its online store.The day was capped off with a cocktail reception hosted by Amazon\u2019s chief spokesman, Jay Carney \u2014 the former press secretary to President Obama.Amazon is sweeping the nation\u2019s capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period.The company\u2019s more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company\u2019s overall reputation, is a break from its past. Before last year, the company relied on a no-frills operation for more than a decade, prodding officials in Washington on narrow laws and regulations and arguing about the nuances of issues like sales taxes and copyright.The efforts may not directly apply to an imminent bill or regulation, but they allow the company to steer policy conversations that may be important to Amazon in the future.

Ryan and other political leaders have visited Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers in their home districts, where Amazon talks up the thousands of jobs those warehouses support.Amazon\u2019s strategic shift has happened as politicians are getting bolder in their criticism about the size and influence of big tech companies. Republicans and Democrats alike have focused on issues including antitrust, privacy and public disclosure.Many of the harshest attacks have been directed at Facebook and Google, which also have robust lobbying arms in Washington. But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company\u2019s push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition. President Trump has lashed out at the company and Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive, multiple times, accusing the company of avoiding taxes among other things. The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes.\u201cThe concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon\u2019s $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy.Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201cThey are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that\u2019s helped it generate a lot of media attention,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon.Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations. More than a dozen organizations were new to its sponsorship roster, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Foundation and the conservative Law & Economic Center at George Mason University.Amazon is racing to catch up. Yet even with similar lobbying armies, Google and Facebook have not escaped criticism \u2014 in their cases over their platforms\u2019 potential to shape public opinion.\u201cWith Amazon, we need more transparency and need to look at longer term factors when it comes to competition,\u201d Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Senator from Minnesota said in a recent interview. \u201cThe people at the Justice Department in antitrust need to look at deals in other ways.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seven Takeaways From the Times Journalists Who Cover Trump", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Oct. 12, Dean Baquet, The Times\u2019s executive editor, joined Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman, two White House correspondents, to discuss the challenges of covering the Trump administration. Jim Rutenberg, The Times\u2019s media columnist, moderated the TimesTalk panel, which was streamed live online.Here are seven takeaways from their conversation.When President Trump rails against the press, is he motivated by a genuine sense of injustice? Or is it part of a ruse to score political points?It\u2019s both, Mr. Baker argued.\u201cI think he genuinely has grievances against the press,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cHe genuinely looks at papers and at the TV and gets mad at what he sees,\u201d which is that, in Mr. Trump\u2019s opinion, the media doesn\u2019t reflect reality, that he doesn\u2019t get enough credit, and that coverage of him and his administration is relentlessly negative, Mr. Baker said.But his tirades are also a shtick in the sense that they\u2019re politically useful, Mr. Baker added.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody lose votes by attacking the press,\u201d he said.\u201cHe\u2019s tempestuous,\u201d Ms. Haberman. \u201cThat\u2019s how he was when he was at his company, and that\u2019s how he is now.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a 71-year-old man,\u201d she said, adding that she doesn\u2019t expect him to change.\u201cIn this way, at least,\u201d Mr. Baker said, \u201cit\u2019s the most transparent presidency we have had in our lifetime \u2014 and maybe ever.\u201dAnd while we\u2019re on the subject of Twitter ...\u201cOh come on,\u201d Mr. Baker said, responding to a question from the Facebook Live audience. \u201cSo, if The New York Times didn\u2019t write about the tweets, the 40 million people reading them \u2014 and the other millions more who would be retweeting \u2014 would suddenly not pay attention, or not care?\u201d he asked.\u201cHe\u2019s the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Baker continued. \u201cWhat he does, for good or bad, is the most central part of our coverage of the government.\u201dMs. Haberman added: \u201cThat\u2019s the definition of bias: If we decided not to cover the president of the United States.\u201dAnonymous sourcing has been a key component to The Times\u2019s coverage of the Trump administration, which has been plagued by a steady flow of internal leaks.But, as one audience member noted, readers often feel ambivalent about articles that use anonymous sources \u2014 especially readers who are not familiar with The Times\u2019s guidelines for the practice.For the most consequential White House stories, Mr. Baquet himself has to approve the use of anonymous sources. \u201cAnd when we do more routine anonymous source stories, whether it\u2019s from the White House or not,\u201d he explained, \u201csenior editors have to know the names of sources, and the circumstances.\u201dThe protocol is strict \u201cbecause we can\u2019t afford to get it wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think we should probably be transparent with people about that.\u201dFor journalists who cover the president, his heated rhetoric against the press \u2014 while sometimes alarming \u2014 is generally tolerable. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the name calling,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cWe\u2019re big boys and girls; we can take it.\u201d\u201cWhat would be disturbing,\u201d he added, \u201cis if that then trails into actual changes in our ability to do our job.\u201dIt would be \u201cbeyond the pale,\u201d Mr. Baquet said, if the Trump administration had subpoenaed phone records, or had gotten secret warrants for phone records, of New York Times reporters \u2014 or if they were wiretapping phones.But it\u2019s not out of the question, Mr. Baquet conceded.Fun fact: Mr. Baker hasn\u2019t voted since he first joined the White House beat, four presidencies ago. \u201cI stopped doing anything that could be perceived as taking a personal position,\u201d he said.As to the charge that The Times has a liberal bias, Mr. Baker drew a distinction between the paper\u2019s news report and its opinion pages.\u201cIf it were up to me, we wouldn\u2019t have editorials, because I think it confuses readers into thinking we\u2019re a liberal paper,\u201d Mr. Baker said.\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself to be a liberal,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think that most people I work with consider themselves to be particularly ideological.\u201d\u201cThe only editorial page I read is The Wall Street Journal,\u201d Ms. Haberman, \u201cand it\u2019s because I just want to understand what is in the mind of Rupert Murdoch, who advises the president.\u201d\u201cI think we try to play this straight down the middle,\u201d she added.What to make of the so-called \u201cmedia bubble\u201d? Is it a legitimate threat to understanding and reporting on the Trump administration?In short, yes.\u201cI think we spend too much time in New York,\u201d Mr. Baquet said, adding that, after the election, The Times increased the number of reporters in the Midwest and set about hiring reporters with a broader range of backgrounds and experiences.\u201cIt just so happens that the best media, the most powerful media, are on the coasts,\u201d Mr. Baquet said. \u201cAnd we have to be careful.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a myth, by the way,\u201d he added, \u201cthat we\u2019re all New York elites.\u201d_____Watch the full discussion here:Advertisement"}

He traced the circuitous path by which he\u2019d been arrested at an anti-Putin rally in Moscow two years ago and now, living in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, is seeking political asylum.The guests peppered him with questions: What were the conditions of the prison like? Have you changed your name? Are you scared?As I tucked into my food, I thought, \u201cThis will definitely be the most nuanced Yelp review I\u2019ll ever write.\u201dIf you start chatting with your Ethiopian cabdriver, it can be rude to ask a lot of questions about Addis Ababa or the Great Rift Valley \u2014 he probably wants to be perceived as American, not Ethiopian.But how should we proceed when the foreigner in question is a refugee, and was forced to leave his country? Nasser Jab, a founder of Displaced Dinners, encourages inquiry: \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to come off as offensive, so they don\u2019t ask questions. But the only way to learn is to ask.\u201dShe said, \u201cIf you were meeting someone who just went through a traumatic divorce, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily say, \u2018So tell me about the divorce \u2014 whose fault was it?\u2019 You can have a very successful evening without delving into the past. And you don\u2019t show up at a dinner party with a bag of used clothes.\u201dDr. McCaffrey remembered one Syria Supper Club dinner she attended shortly after the organization was started in December 2015. \u201cOne of the cooks introduced herself to us all with, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m a Syrian refugee and I appreciate your help.\u2019 People responded, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re so glad to be here, we really want to help you!\u2019 But my partner and I didn\u2019t want the conversation to go that way. We want to reinforce the idea of these folks being new neighbors. We want to reinforce their dignity. I\u2019m not sure that storytelling is empowering.\u201dIndeed, even the word \u201crefugee,\u201d loaded as it is with meaning, can throw Americans off balance. One of the Displaced Dinners speakers is a gay Syrian refugee named Lutfi who was persecuted for many years for his sexual orientation. Disowned by his family and arrested in both Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, he now lives in New York and works at a clothing store in SoHo.Lutfi takes no issue with his official designation: \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with \u2018refugee.\u2019 I\u2019m a very proud \u2018refugee\u2019!\u201d However, he added, \u201cOne girl at work, the first week we were very friendly. But when I told her I am a Syrian refugee, she stopped joking with me. Suddenly just \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018goodbye.\u2019\u201dSome relief workers suggest that the best way to navigate these shores is to let the refugee steer the conversation, and to be discreet about using the \u201cr\u201d word. Hisham Zawil, who runs the International Rescue Committee\u2019s office in Oakland, Calif., said that a person who has worked in the group\u2019s youth program for two years \u201chas never talked to these kids about their refugee story or where they\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s sometimes not appropriate.\u201dAnother misperception that many Americans have is that all refugees are poor. \u201cA lot of our chefs come from the middle class or even upper class,\u201d Ms. Kahi said. \u201cIt makes it hard to be seen as someone who needs charity.\u201dMr. Jisri said, \u201cAhmet looked at him and said, \u2018I had what you have. But unfortunately I lost it. It wasn\u2019t in my hands to have this war. But I still have my iPhone.\u2019\u201dAmericans are also sometimes wont to overvalue the solaces of their own country. \u201cRefugees are being welcomed to a place that they don\u2019t necessarily want to be,\u201d Mr. Zawil said. \u201cThat\u2019s tough for people to understand. An American native who\u2019s very well intentioned might say, \u2018You must be really happy that you\u2019re in California!\u2019 But to someone who\u2019s just lost his home, that might be the last thing on his mind.\u201dMohammed al-Jokhadar, a founding member of the Syrian Thanksgiving Group, which delivers meals to shelters in Halifax, Nova Scotia, made mostly by refugees and Syrian-Americans, said that a Syrian refugee asked him, \u201cAre there any legal repercussions to me getting help from a psychiatrist?\u201d\u201cIn Syria, it exists, psychological therapy,\u201d Mr. al-Jokhadar said. \u201cBut most people, especially older ones, don\u2019t try it.\u201d Mr. al-Jokhadar said that it may help if American and Canadian natives subtly let it be known to refugees if they themselves have sought psychological counseling.But the greatest need, of course, is for Americans to educate themselves about the mores of their newcomers. Mr. al-Jokhadar, who said his fellow Syrians are more affectionate and excitable than Canadians, finds himself reminding new arrivals of two things. First, \u201cIn Arabic, you say that you \u2018love\u2019 a friend, but in Canada, you cannot walk around saying \u2018I love you\u2019 to everybody.\u201dSecond, locking arms with another man has a different implication in the Western world. \u201cWe did it at Walmart and people thought we were gay\u201d Mr. al-Jokhadar said of himself and a friend. \u201cThey were looking at us weird.\u201d He has experienced similar misunderstandings when kissing other Syrian men on the cheek.In an ideal world, the differences between the two parties \u2014 native and newcomer \u2014 would work to each party\u2019s advantage. Consider the case of Jo Du, who was married in Guelph, Ontario, in September. Just hours before her ceremony, the zipper on her wedding dress broke. No one in her bridal party knew how to fix it, or where to find a tailor on a Sunday.A bridesmaid ran next door to borrow a pair of pliers from a neighbor. This neighbor, it turned out, had been hosting a family of Syrian refugees for four days; the father of the family had been a tailor in Aleppo for 28 years. The father and his young son scurried over to the bride\u2019s house, sewing kit in tow: wedding saved.When the wedding photographer posted the serendipitous turn of events on Facebook, one of the photographer\u2019s friends offered the tailor a five-thread table sewing machine for free. Another person set up an online fund-raising page to cover the health care costs of the tailor and his family.In the end, resettlement is not a one-way street. When I asked Lutfi how he felt about the word \u201crefugee,\u201d he proudly said, \u201cFrom the third world to the first!\u201d But the first world must also voyage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Focused Bets on Growth Propel Three Stock Funds", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe managers of three of the third quarter\u2019s better-performing mutual funds thrived by betting on growth: They all favored companies that have been increasing their earnings at faster-than-average rates.They are also willing to double their bets, holding far fewer stocks than the typical actively managed mutual fund.Managers sometimes load up on lots of stocks \u2014 the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar holds 164 \u2014 to diversify their holdings, preventing a few bad bets from sapping the overall return. Some research has shown, Ms. Starke said, that \u201cyou get rid of much of that risk by the time you hit 20 stocks.\u201d She said she tried to own what she called \u201ccore growth names,\u201d like Facebook and Amazon, and would then \u201cpepper in some interesting emerging companies.\u201d When managers hoard too many stocks, she said, their funds can end up performing like the overall market.In sleuthing out shares, Ms. Starke leans toward the information technology and health care sectors. \u201cThat\u2019s where you find the most innovation and differentiation,\u201d she said. Her largest holding at midyear was Alexion Pharmaceuticals, a maker of drugs for rare diseases.Alexion has been restructuring, with layoffs and a planned move of its headquarters from New Haven, Conn. to Boston. An internal investigation uncovered improper sales practices, but Ms. Starke said she viewed the company\u2019s troubles as transitory. \u201cThey have a growing drug pipeline,\u201d she said, \u201cand the bad news didn\u2019t affect the longer-term fundamentals.\u201dThe distinctive nature of biotechnology companies\u2019 product pipelines is a draw for Ms. Starke. \u201cThe companies are typically not competing against each other \u2014 they can all be addressing different diseases,\u201d she said. The health care sector, which includes biotechnology, recently accounted for about a third of her fund\u2019s assets \u2014 about twice as much as her average Morningstar peer.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 1.15 percent, returned 8.1 percent for the third quarter, compared with the 4.48 percent returned by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500.John H. Neff, one of the three portfolio managers, said that he and his two colleagues, Charles T. Akre Jr. and Thomas Saberhagen, liken their investment process to a three-legged stool. They seek businesses with strong competitive advantages, skilled and honest management and promising opportunities for reinvestment.\u201cOur job is to be as discriminating as we can in identifying these three-legged stool businesses and to be discriminating in what we pay for them,\u201d Mr. Neff said. If stocks do not meet those criteria, the fund will sometimes let cash build up. \u201cIf we\u2019re not seeing opportunities that meet that hurdle, it sits.\u201dA theme in the portfolio is what Mr. Neff called \u201cbottleneck\u201d or \u201ctoll-bridge\u201d businesses: outfits that operate at a choke point in the economy and profit from their position.Consider Mastercard, a top recent holding. The volume of electronic transactions, which Mastercard processes, continues to grow, but cash and checks still prevail worldwide, Mr. Neff said. That represents a hefty opportunity for handlers of electronic payments. \u201cWhatever you buy and wherever you buy it in the world, we own a business that has improving odds of being involved,\u201d he said.Mr. Neff said that another of the fund\u2019s top holdings, Moody\u2019s, the credit-rating agency, likewise stood athwart a toll bridge: Its ratings are critical in the issuance of bonds and other debt securities. The biggest raters \u2014 Standard & Poor\u2019s is the other \u2014 came under fire after the financial crisis because some of the subprime mortgage bonds they classified as investment-worthy ended up collapsing, and some policy makers have called for greater competition in the industry. So far, though, Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s continue to dominate, and Mr. Neff said that he and his colleagues do not foresee that changing soon.The Akre fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 1.34 percent, returned 9.99 percent in the third quarter.Mr. DuFour has latelyheard that bang coming fromtechnology stocks, which accounted for 40 percent of the fund at September\u2019s end. In picking stocks, he said, he does not heed sector classifications. \u201cI\u2019m sector agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cMy overweights change based on where I find good investments, and I see great stuff in tech now.\u201dHe added he did not see his technology investments as bets solely on computers and the web. PayPal, for example, was a top recent holding, and the company is an innovator in the technology for handling online payments. \u201cBut they also do loans and credit cards,\u201d he said.The growth in electronic payments is one of the three themes that unify the fund, he said. The others are the internet, especially the emergence of artificial intelligence, and exchanged-traded funds.Mr. DuFour said that working for Fidelity, one of the country\u2019s largest asset managers, had given him insight into the upsurge in E.T.F. investment. Fidelity, like its industry counterparts, has had money flow out of its actively managed funds and into its passively managed ones, including E.T.F.s, he said. (An E.T.F., like a traditional index mutual fund, often tracks an index.)\u201cAs I look for ways to play that, it turns out that people who own the indexes are in a very advantageous position,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, in my top 10, one of the names that shows up is Standard & Poor\u2019s,\u201d which is also a leading creator of indexes. Every E.T.F. built around, say, the S.&P. 500 must pay Standard & Poor\u2019s for theright to use the index.Mr. DuFour\u2019s fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 0.62 percent, returned 7.75 percent in the third quarter. Mr. DuFour has managed the fund since 2007. Over that time, it has returned an annualized average of 8.41 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dartmouth College Professors Investigated Over Sexual Misconduct Allegations", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANOVER, N.H. \u2014 Three Dartmouth College professors whose research included studies of sexual desire and attractiveness have been put on paid leave while a criminal investigation of alleged sexual misconduct is carried out, the authorities said Tuesday.Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald of New Hampshire said his office was part of a joint criminal investigation by five law enforcement agencies into allegations of \u201cserious misconduct\u201d by the professors, all male tenured faculty members in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. The professors\u2019 access to the Dartmouth campus has been restricted.At that time, the college, which has 4,300 undergraduates and 2,000 graduate students, announced that it was conducting its own official review.At the bucolic Ivy League campus on Tuesday, where leaves were blowing on a blustery fall afternoon, news of the criminal investigation left many students bewildered as few details were given of the accusations against the professors.Several students gathered at the Collis Center for Student Involvement on Tuesday said they were surprised by the allegations.Maggie Pizzo, a junior math major, said she was concerned that the professors had been put on paid leave during the investigation as opposed to suspended without pay.\u201cBy paying them, it seems to be condoning the acts,\u201d whatever they were, she said, as well as being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d toward whoever brought the allegations of misconduct.One female student, a junior who declined to give her name, said she felt \u201cpretty uncomfortable\u201d that the administration had apparently known about the allegations for some time and was only now addressing them publicly.She said that graduate students were filling in for the accused professors and that some students felt shortchanged by not being taught by the scholars they had signed up for.Elizabeth Southwell, 24, a Dartmouth alumna, said she had taken courses with all three of the professors while a student at Dartmouth. News of the investigation, she said, had ricocheted among alumni over Facebook and in text messages.\u201cI\u2019m very, very shocked,\u201d Ms. Southwell said. \u201cA large group, three of them placed on leave. Three of the professors who had some of the best reputations as teachers.\u201dDr. Heatherton leads a center for social brain sciences and, according to the college\u2019s website, conducts research in social behavior focusing on self-regulation, self-esteem and self-referential processing. He had been an unpaid visiting scholar at New York University since July, with no classroom duties, but his time there ended last Thursday \u201cby mutual agreement,\u201d according to John H. Beckman, an N.Y.U. spokesman.\u201cN.Y.U. was unaware of the Dartmouth investigation until quite recently,\u201d Mr. Beckman said. \u201cThe university was given no specifics about its nature or duration.\u201dDr. Kelley\u2019s work focuses on memory and self-regulation, according to the website.Dr. Heatherton and Dr. Kelley were among the authors of a 2012 research study on how images of food and sex affect the brain. As part of the research, 58 female college freshmen underwent brain scans shortly after arrival on campus while viewing 80 images each of animals, environmental scenes, food items and people \u2014 some involved in sexual scenes or consuming alcohol. Six months later, they were called back to the lab, weighed and questioned on their sexual behavior.None of the professors could be reached for comment.\u201cI want to say in the most emphatic way possible that sexual misconduct and harassment are unacceptable and have no place at Dartmouth,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cSuch acts harm us as individuals and as members of the community.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Las Vegas Shooting, Fake News Regains Its Megaphone", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftWhen they woke up and glanced at their phones on Monday morning, Americans may have been shocked to learn that the man behind the mass shooting in Las Vegas late on Sunday was an anti-Trump liberal who liked Rachel Maddow and MoveOn.org, that the F.B.I. had already linked him to the Islamic State, and that mainstream news organizations were suppressing that he had recently converted to Islam.They were shocking, gruesome revelations. They were also entirely false \u2014 and widely spread by Google and Facebook.Google and Facebook blamed algorithm errors for these.A Google spokesman said, \u201cThis should not have appeared for any queries, and we\u2019ll continue to make algorithmic improvements to prevent this from happening in the future.\u201dA Facebook spokesman said, \u201cWe are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused.\u201dBut this was no one-off incident. Over the past few years, extremists, conspiracy theorists and government-backed propagandists have made a habit of swarming major news events, using search-optimized \u201ckeyword bombs\u201d and algorithm-friendly headlines. These organizations are skilled at reverse-engineering the ways that tech platforms parse information, and they benefit from a vast real-time amplification network that includes 4Chan and Reddit as well as Facebook, Twitter and Google. Even when these campaigns are thwarted, they often last hours or days \u2014 long enough to spread misleading information to millions of people.The latest fake news flare-up came at an inconvenient time for companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are already defending themselves from accusations that they have let malicious actors run rampant on their platforms.There is also a labeling issue. A Facebook user looking for news about the Las Vegas shooting on Monday morning, or a Google user searching for information about the wrongfully accused shooter, would have found posts from 4Chan and Sputnik alongside articles by established news organizations like CNN and NBC News, with no obvious cues to indicate which ones came from reliable sources.The automation of editorial judgment, combined with tech companies\u2019 reluctance to appear partisan, has created a lopsided battle between those who want to spread misinformation and those tasked with policing it. Posting a malicious rumor on Facebook, or writing a false news story that is indexed by Google, is a nearly instantaneous process; removing such posts often requires human intervention. This imbalance gives an advantage to rule-breakers, and makes it impossible for even an army of well-trained referees to keep up.The investigations into Russia\u2019s exploitation of social media during the 2016 presidential election will almost certainly continue for months. But dozens of less splashy online misinformation campaigns are happening every day, and they deserve attention, too. Tech companies should act decisively to prevent hoaxes and misinformation from spreading on their platforms, even if it means hiring thousands more moderators or angering some partisan organizations.Facebook and Google have spent billions of dollars developing virtual reality systems. They can spare a billion or two to protect actual reality.Advertisement"}

The new tokens are usually designed so that they can be used only on a computing service the programmers are building.Filecoin, which raised $257 million in the largest coin offering to date, is being designed to pay for storage on a global cloud storage network that the creators of Filecoin are promising to build. BET, another coin, is being designed to serve as the chips in an online casino its programmers are promising to build.\u201cPromising to build\u201d is the operative phrase here, because in almost every case the services that will supposedly make these coins valuable have not yet been finished.These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist \u2014 to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity \u2014 and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem.Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network). What\u2019s more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology.But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value.The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors. But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors don\u2019t get an ownership stake in the start-ups. If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law. A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it.Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used. So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed.In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up. When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny. In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase.After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding \u2014 similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O. The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up.The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future.The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists. The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded. The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesn\u2019t even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million.Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings don\u2019t have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors.Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital won\u2019t fund. Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum. Filecoin\u2019s cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company.It is easier than it seems. The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics. There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept. Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything.Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.China and South Korea have said it is illegal.In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds. If a coin is categorized as a security, it has to follow all relevant securities law, such as registering with the authorities and ensuring that people buying the coins are properly accredited and vetted. Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules.Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down. Some are expecting that the first targets will be the exchanges where the coins are traded.Investors don\u2019t have much recourse. The most likely outcome will be that the investors will lose the money they put into the project, though people may try to sue.A number of prominent Silicon Valley investors have argued that coin offerings could provide a way to build open-source projects that would not have otherwise received support.Some big names think this will lead to a new generation of open-source internet protocols and loosen the control of big companies like Google and Facebook.But even sophisticated enthusiasts believe that almost all of the companies currently raising money through coin offerings will fail and lose money for their investors \u2014 and probably should not happen in the first place.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daryl Morey Built an Elite N.B.A. Team. Now He\u2019s Building a Musical.", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDaryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, has a feel for evaluating prospects and identifying talent.But this was different.Last year, during a brief hiatus from his day job scrutinizing jab steps and jump shots, Morey was able to partake in another interest \u2014 by sizing up love ballads submitted by composers who were vying to work on a musical comedy that he is producing. He later huddled with the show\u2019s writer and director.\u201cI made them follow our pre-draft process,\u201d Morey said. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018We all have to rank the players. And we can\u2019t talk before we rank them because you have to eliminate group think.\u2019 And then after we did all the rankings, we talked about it.\u201d\u201cSomeday,\u201d Morey said, \u201cI want to live in New York and just go to shows.\u201dFor now, he will settle for moonlighting as a producer.\u201cWe\u2019re just a bunch of friends doing this at this point,\u201d Morey said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cI guess we do have official titles: book writer, composer, director. So I\u2019m a producer of some ilk, whether that\u2019s executive producer or just producer.\u201dHe paused to consider his role.\u201cI provide the money,\u201d he said.The story that Maher wrote tells of a newly discovered island nation that decides to join the modern world by fielding a team for an international basketball league. The country \u2014 Lilliput, from \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels,\u201d which, lo and behold, exists in Maher\u2019s fantasyland \u2014 proceeds to sink its entire treasury into building a court and signing Michael Jordan, a journeyman point guard who just happens to have the same name as the iconic star. But that is all they share.\u201cHe\u2019s not a very good basketball player,\u201d Maher said.There are other problems: Lilliput is a land of small people, so all of Jordan\u2019s teammates are 6 inches tall. Also, the country has no concept of the number five, so the coach is limited to sending just four players onto the court at a time. When Morey learned that Maher had included this plot twist, it bugged him.\u201cI\u2019m very logical,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t get it: How would these people not know that you need five players? And Mickle is like, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve done 40 plays. This is going to work.\u2019 And he was 100 percent right.\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2019s a love story,\u201d Maher said.Whenever Morey visits New York for work, he tries to find time for a show.\u201cYou can walk up 15 minutes beforehand and ask for a deal on a single,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one else is lame enough to do this, but I\u2019m lame enough to do it.\u201d\u201cAnd it was just this wall of text,\u201d Nodler said. \u201cHere I was, thinking that I was contacting this great hero of mine. It turns out he was so excited to hear from somebody in the theater.\u201dNodler invited Morey to see one of his plays at Catastrophic, and a friendship developed. Morey soon joined the theater\u2019s board of directors.\u201cI didn\u2019t think the worlds of theater and basketball intersected,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI thought the Venn diagram would be one person: me. As it turns out, there are a few of us.\u201dEventually, Nodler pitched the idea of collaborating on a basketball musical. Morey sketched out a few ideas. Knowing they would need a writer, Nodler gauged Maher\u2019s interest; Catastrophic had staged several of his plays. Plus, Nodler knew that Maher was a fellow basketball fan.\u201cI think I said, \u2018That\u2019s the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard,\u2019 \u201d Maher said.Maher had his reasons for being apprehensive. A lot of sports-themed musicals have tanked. But the more that Maher considered the project, the more he wanted to take on the challenge.\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d Maher said.This July, at a weeklong workshop at Catastrophic, the \u201cSmall Ball\u201d team \u2014 Nodler, Maher and Morey, along with the songwriters van Dijk and Barilla \u2014 developed the material with the help of a group of actors.\u201cDaryl\u2019s the person who could come into the room and suck up all the oxygen and boss everyone around,\u201d Maher said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just not that way at all. He has a great deal of respect for everyone who\u2019s involved in the process and gives notes and ideas in the most welcome way.\u201dMorey said his role at the workshop was minor.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything but sit and clap,\u201d he said.Still, Morey said he came away feeling energized. He also gained an appreciation for the talent of the actors and for his theater colleagues\u2019 managerial skills.\u201cLet\u2019s keep it vague,\u201d Morey said, \u201cbut I\u2019m like, \u2018Geez, they deal with more stuff than I do.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside North Korea, and Feeling the Drums of War", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWarmbier was the University of Virginia student who was arrested for stealing a poster, then sentenced to 15 years of hard labor and eventually returned to the U.S. in a vegetative state.\u201cHe broke the law in our country,\u201d said Ri Yong-pil, a senior Foreign Ministry official, adding that Warmbier was returned (a week before his death) as a \u201chumanitarian\u201d act. Another senior ministry official, Choe Kang-il, insisted that North Korea had provided excellent care and spent \u201call the money for nursing\u201d him.Something in me snapped. I asked how North Koreans could possibly boast about their spending on a young man when he was in a coma only because of them. Choe replied just as hotly that Warmbier had not been mistreated and was in fine condition when he was sent back home.\u201cThe U.S. administration, or some people with a certain intention, let him die,\u201d Choe said. \u201cThis must be intended to foster and spread anti-Communist hatred within America.\u201dOfficials offered no apology and gave no ground, reflecting a hard line toward the United States that I found everywhere on this visit; Choe derided President Trump as \u201ca crazy man,\u201d \u201ca thug\u201d and \u201ca pathetic man with a big mouth.\u201d I\u2019ve been covering North Korea on and off since the 1980s, and this five-day trip has left me more alarmed than ever about the risks of a catastrophic confrontation.I was given a visa to North Korea, as were three other New York Times journalists. The U.S. State Department promptly gave us an exemption from the travel ban to North Korea and issued special passports good for a single trip here.Far more than when I previously visited, North Korea is galvanizing its people to expect a nuclear war with the United States. High school students march in the streets in military uniform every day to denounce America. Posters and billboards along the public roads show missiles destroying the U.S. Capitol and shredding the American flag. In fact, images of missiles are everywhere \u2014 in a kindergarten playground, at a dolphin show, on state television. This military mobilization is accompanied by the ubiquitous assumption that North Korea could not only survive a nuclear conflict, but also win it.\u201cIf we have to go to war, we won\u2019t hesitate to totally destroy the United States,\u201d explained Mun Hyok-myong, a 38-year-old teacher visiting an amusement park.Ryang Song-chol, a 41-year-old factory worker, looked surprised when I asked if his country could survive a war with America. \u201cWe would certainly win,\u201d he said.These interviews were conducted in the presence of two Foreign Ministry officials, but even if they weren\u2019t, there is no chance that ordinary people would speak freely to a foreign reporter. This is perhaps the most tightly controlled country in the world, so such quotes should be seen as reflecting a government script \u2014 in this case, a disturbingly jingoistic one.On past trips (my last was in 2005), we journalists stayed at hotels in the capital and were free to walk around on our own, but this time the Foreign Ministry housed us at its own guarded Kobangsan Guest House east of the capital. At first I thought this was simply to restrict us, but increasingly I saw signs of something more interesting and menacing: The Foreign Ministry was also protecting us from hard-liners in the military or in the security services.\u201cSomeone might hear you are from America,\u201d and there could be trouble, one official explained.Hard-liners seem to have gained greater power this year, especially after Trump\u2019s threat to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea, and we were told that military officers sometimes mock their own country\u2019s diplomats for being wimpish \u201cAmerican cronies.\u201dForeign Ministry officials escorted us every time we left the compound, probably both to keep us out of mischief and to protect us from the security agencies.Yes, all this has been a little discomfiting.The upshot is that I have felt more constraint than on past visits to North Korea, and considerably more tension. Before, I had been able to see senior generals, but this time the military flatly refused to consider my interview requests. The security forces also refused my request to meet the three Americans whom they still detain, one for two years now, without consular access.A basic problem is that hard-liners seem ascendant in both Washington and Pyongyang.In Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s capital, which is full of wide streets and monumental buildings, officials also express little interest in the kind of tough compromises that would be necessary to resolve the crisis.\u201cThe situation on the Korean Peninsula is on the eve of the breakout of nuclear war,\u201d Choe, the Foreign Ministry official, told me. \u201cWe can survive\u201d such a war, he added, and he and other officials said that it was not the right time for talks with the U.S.The North Koreans insist that the U.S. make the first move and drop its sanctions and \u201chostile attitude\u201d \u2014 which won\u2019t happen. And the U.S. is equally unrealistic in insisting that North Korea give up its entire nuclear program.I told Choe that my visit gave me a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, reminding me of a trip to Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq on the eve of the American invasion. The difference is that a war here would be not just a regional disaster but a nuclear cataclysm.Choe was unimpressed by my warning. He said that Iraq and Libya had made the mistake of giving up their nuclear programs; in each case, America then ousted the regime. He added that the lesson was obvious, so North Korea will never negotiate away its nuclear warheads.Officials used to deny that there was ever any crime in North Korea \u2014 but now they freely concede that this country has thieves, that young women sometimes become pregnant before marriage, that inevitably there\u2019s a measure of corruption. (They do deny that North Korea has any gay people.)North Korea is no longer hermetically sealed, and South Korean pop music and soap operas are smuggled in on flash drives and DVDs from China (watching them is a serious criminal offense). There is also an intranet \u2014 a rigidly controlled domestic version of the internet \u2014 and students learn English from about the third grade. At the best schools, like Pyongyang No. 1 Secondary School, the students are extraordinarily bright and they conversed with us in fluent English, with far more sophistication than on my first visit to the same school in 1989.Yet this is still North Korea. I asked these kids if they had ever heard of Beyonc\u00e9 or the Beatles; none had. I asked if they had heard of Facebook. One had, because computer software sometimes referred to it, but he didn\u2019t know what it was.Radios or televisions that might get foreign broadcasts are illegal, and there is no access to the internet except for foreigners and senior officials. When I arrived at the airport, my luggage was closely searched for pernicious publications, and even my phone was examined.\u201cWho\u2019s this person,\u201d the customs official asked suspiciously when she saw an Asian woman appear frequently in my photos.\u201cMy wife,\u201d I explained.\u201cOh,\u201d she said, deflated. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201dEach home or village has a speaker, a link from Big Brother, that drums in propaganda each morning. Religion and civil society are not allowed. Government controls frayed during the terrible famine of the 1990s, when perhaps 10 percent of the population died, but the controls have returned with the economic recovery. This is the most totalitarian state in the history of the world, because it has computers, closed-circuit cameras, mobile phones and other monitoring technologies that Stalin or Mao could only have dreamed of.North Korea is also sometimes simply weird. Triplets are taken from their parents and raised by the state because they are considered auspicious. The personality cult is unyielding, with every adult wearing pins of \u201cthe Great Leader,\u201d Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994, or his son, \u201cthe Dear Leader,\u201d Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011, and their portraits are in every home, every factory, every classroom.Every year, people die trying to rescue the Kim portraits from house fires (whether because of genuine loyalty or to win credit with the authorities), and now this Confucian-style reverence is directed to Kim Jong-un, 33, the scion of the dynasty. His name means \u201cjust and merciful,\u201d and the state media are worshipful about his \u201cbrilliant intelligence, military acumen, matchless courage and outstanding art of command,\u201d as one publication put it.Do people really believe this stuff?I\u2019ve interviewed countless defectors over the years, and they say that there\u2019s more disenchantment among the youth and in the China border area, where Koreans realize that their country has been left behind. But the defectors add that many North Koreans, especially older ones and those distant from the China border, genuinely believe in the system and worship the Kim family \u2014 because they know nothing else.What makes this moment so perilous is that North Koreans are steeped in the idea that they have repeatedly defeated the U.S. \u2014 and can do so again. Every single person we spoke to, from officials to students, voiced certainty that if war breaks out, America will end up in ashes and the Kim regime will emerge victorious.\u201cU.S. pride will be squished,\u201d predicted Jo Yong-myong, a 20-year-old university student, who thinks war is likely. \u201cThe big nose of the U.S. will be cut off.\u201dMaybe Kim himself isn\u2019t so recklessly overconfident. But historically, one risk is that dictators come to believe their own propaganda.For a glimpse of the state narrative, I visited the huge new museum in Pyongyang that Kim built for the Korean War. It flatly asserts the standard North Korean line that American imperialists started the war in 1950 by invading the North, rather than (as historians say) that the North started it by sending soldiers into South Korea, and it says that American atrocities in Korea were worse than those of Hitler. \u201cThey killed Korean people for their pleasure,\u201d First Lt. Jang Un-hye, 24, our military guide in the museum, told me as she led me by an exhibit devoted to American use of biological weapons in the war (most historians say this is a fabrication).One hall in the war museum, called \u201cDefeat of the U.S.,\u201d showed a huge diorama with an American soldier\u2019s corpse being picked at by crows, with the sound of their caws filling the room.Next to the museum is the Pueblo, the American Navy ship seized by North Korea in 1968 \u2014 another victory by the Korean People\u2019s Army over the American imperialists! At the border with South Korea is a museum displaying the ax used to kill two American soldiers there in 1976, also presented as a triumph.Somehow for all the official hostility, North Koreans tend to be friendly to individual Americans. At the new science and technology tower in Pyongyang, I met a 13-year-old boy, Paek Sin-hyok, who daily participates in military parades at his middle school to mobilize for war. It was his first time meeting Americans, and he said his heart was thumping. I asked about the common North Korean expression that \u201cjust as a wolf cannot become a lamb, so an American imperialist can never change his aggressive nature.\u201d\u201cWhat about us?\u201d I asked him. \u201cAre we wolves? Or lambs?\u201dHe struggled with how to answer that politely. \u201cHalf and half,\u201d he said.With this mutual distrust, it\u2019s easy to see how things might go wrong. I suspect North Korea is rational and cares about self-preservation, and I don\u2019t believe that it would fire off a nuclear missile at Guam or Los Angeles just for the thrill. But a dogfight between a North Korean and an American plane could cause a crisis that escalates. Or Trump could order an airstrike on a North Korean missile during fueling on the launchpad \u2014 and that, every North Korean official said, would lead to war.My sense is that both sides are fearful of appearing weak and are trying to intimidate the other with military bluster, but that each would prefer a peaceful resolution \u2014 yet doesn\u2019t know how to get there politically. So how do we get out of this mess?First, Trump should stop personalizing and escalating the conflict. Second, we need talks without conditions, if only talks about talks: I\u2019d suggest a secret visit to Pyongyang by a senior administration official, as well as discussions with North Korea\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. Third, human rights have to be part of the agenda, backed by the threat of suspending North Korea\u2019s credentials at the United Nations. Fourth, we should support organizations that smuggle information on USB drives into North Korea; this would be cheap and might contribute to change in the long term. Fifth, increase cyberwarfare, which the U.S. has already used effectively against North Korea. Sixth, let\u2019s enforce tighter sanctions, but only if harnessed to a plausible outcome.Ultimately, the best hope that is realistic may be a variant of what\u2019s called a \u201cfreeze for a freeze,\u201d with North Korea halting its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a reduction in sanctions and in U.S.-South Korean military exercises \u2014 as an interim step, preserving the long-term goal of denuclearization. Unfortunately, both sides resist this approach; I was disappointed in the lack of North Korean interest.So if we can\u2019t work out a freeze for a freeze, realistically the next best option is to settle into long-term mutual deterrence. But that would be risky, not least because we have an American president and a North Korean leader who both seem impetuous, overconfident and temperamentally inclined to escalate any dispute \u2014 and the American mainland increasingly will be in the cross hairs of North Korean nuclear warheads.I leave North Korea with the same sense of foreboding that I felt after leaving Saddam\u2019s Iraq in 2002. War is preventable, but I\u2019m not sure it will be prevented.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vatican Shines Light on Child Abuse as Claims Against Priests Persist", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 For a church hierarchy excoriated for decades over the sexual abuse of children in its trust, hosting a conference this week about the spreading scourge of online child pornography was an opportunity to strike a positive note about the Vatican\u2019s role in protecting minors.It was just the latest of the abuse accusations against priests that have dogged the church around the globe for decades even as it has promised to punish predators and protect the preyed upon. Advocates for the victims have questioned the church\u2019s commitment.Cardinal Parolin, speaking to reporters on Tuesday before his address, called the case a \u201cvery painful affair, a great trial for all those who are involved.\u201d He said the priest\u2019s case was being handled with the \u201cutmost seriousness.\u201d The Vatican has also said that the Holy See\u2019s chief prosecutor was investigating and that if the monsignor was tried and convicted, he could be sentenced up to 12 years in a Vatican jail.But advocates for victims have argued that the Vatican\u2019s invocation of diplomatic immunity to recall the Italian monsignor from the United States shows that it still prioritizes protecting its own.In his speech before top Italian officials and representatives from Interpol, the United Nations, Russia, China, the United States, Facebook and Microsoft, Cardinal Parolin spoke at length about the growing threat of internet abuse on the spirit and psyches of young users. He acknowledged that when it came to the exploitation and abuse of children, \u201cover the past few decades, this tragic reality has come powerfully to the fore in the Catholic Church, and extremely grave facts have emerged.\u201dLast month, Francis said in unscripted remarks to a commission he had created to advise him on the issue that the church had \u201carrived late\u201d to the crisis. He lamented his leniency, early in his pontificate, toward an Italian priest who subsequently continued his abuse.\u201cThe old practice of moving people around and not confronting the problem made consciences fall asleep,\u201d the pope said. He said he would limit the chances of pedophile priests to appeal their convictions by church tribunals.A commission Francis created with top cardinals, outside experts and abuse victims (the committee\u2019s only two victims have since left) has seemed stifled by Vatican bureaucracy.The Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, said he was confident that this time, the accused cleric would face justice.\u201cEveryone who commits a crime needs to be punished,\u201d he said. \u201cPeriod.\u201dThe congress, meanwhile, is seeking ways to protect children in what has been depicted as a frightening digital world, where abusers surf a dark web and child pornography proliferates.For years, top Vatican officials in Rome had dismissed the abuse crisis as a unique product of the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggested that it had been overplayed by the news media. But organizers of the congress said the majority of the experts came from countries in the global north because that is where the problem has been confronted most aggressively.In an interview, Father Zollner said that on his global travels looking into the problem, he had observed that bishops and clerics in countries such as Malawi were finally facing an issue they would not talk about as recently as a year ago. But other nations are still constrained by local cultural taboos about discussing child abuse, he said.Father Zollner he said the media focus on Monsignor Capella could have a positive side effect and put \u201cmore attention to the topic of the congress,\u201d which, he said, was to better understand the phenomenon of child pornography and how to prevent it.\u201cThat is our whole purpose,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He was 94.Megan Bond, a close friend of Mr. Beckey\u2019s, wrote in a Facebook message that he died of congestive heart failure in her home. A longtime resident of Seattle, he had been in hospice care for four days, she said.Rawboned and tenacious, Mr. Beckey made as many as a thousand ascents that no one was known to have taken before. He wrote a dozen books on mountaineering, many of them considered definitive guides to the terrain of the continent\u2019s best-known and least accessible peaks.Mr. Beckey was virtually unknown to the general public \u2014 the exact opposite of Sir Edmund Hillary, the New Zealander who, with his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, won worldwide fame by conquering Earth\u2019s tallest peak, the 29,029-foot Mount Everest, on the Nepal-Tibet border in 1953.Indeed, Mr. Beckey shunned publicity and people. He lived like a hermit in Seattle, holing up to write or vanishing for months on expeditions. He looked like a scruffy hobo \u2014 a wiry, stooped nomad with a backpack, a shapeless jacket, dirty pants and sneakers. But he was all-purpose: the craggy face leathery from sun, wind and snow; powerful hands scarred with cuts; flyaway hair crushed under a woolen cap; keen eyes for the next toehold; and a toothy smile for the book signings.He never married or had children, never had a business or sought security. Friends said he just wanted to climb mountains.But to the fraternity of climbing enthusiasts around the world, he was a phenomenon whose exploits above clouds and tree lines at 10,000 to 20,000 feet resounded in mountaineering lore and journals: the achievements of an eccentric daredevil who took on the continent\u2019s last unclimbed peaks and uncharted routes, who probably took more risks than anyone in history.He wrote guidebooks and lectured for the cognoscenti, Americans and Canadians who appreciated the history, topography and perilous beauty of their wilderness strongholds, and for those who hoped to test their mettle on glacial escarpments with rope, ice ax and aching limbs for the reward of standing on the crown of a mountain called Terror or Despair, overlooking a vast panorama of the world.He climbed Africa\u2019s tallest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro (19,341 feet), and Switzerland\u2019s highest massif, Monte Rosa (15,203). But he rarely ventured into the Himalayas, straddling the borders of China and India, where a dozen of the world\u2019s greatest summits defied human intrusion for centuries, rising more than five miles above sea level into an otherworldly realm of yawning abysses, 100-mile-an-hour winds, perpetual cold, and air so thin that the human brain and lungs cannot function properly in it.While other experienced mountaineers repeated ascents of Himalayan and Andean peaks for speed records, Mr. Beckey roamed North America in search of unconquered summits and routes considered too difficult to climb. He often climbed 40 or 50 different peaks a year.He was not the first to climb Alaska\u2019s Denali (20,310), North America\u2019s highest peak (formerly known as Mount McKinley). A team did that in 1913. But in 1954 he and several friends achieved mountaineering\u2019s Triple Crown by reaching the caps of the Alaska Range giants: Mounts Hunter (14,573) and Deborah (12,339) \u2014 both in virgin ascents \u2014 and Denali\u2019s rarely climbed North Peak (19,470).In a notoriously dangerous sport, Mr. Beckey sustained a crushed rib cage and another climber, Charles Shiverick, was killed when an avalanche carried them a quarter of a mile down Mount Serra in British Columbia in 1947. An ice pinnacle snared Mr. Beckey\u2019s rope, saving him, but his companion struck a rock and died of internal injuries.In an international expedition in 1955 to conquer the world\u2019s fourth-highest peak, Lhotse (27,940) in the Himalayas, Mr. Beckey was denounced by colleagues for abandoning his tentmate with a cerebral edema at 23,000 feet in a howling blizzard the night before they were to attempt the summit. He descended alone, he said, to get help.The stricken man, snow-blind and nearly frozen without a sleeping bag, was rescued by others, but it was a misadventure that Mr. Beckey never lived down. While he was a compelling choice for the first American team assault on Everest in 1963, he was not invited \u2014 a snub that ended his Himalayan forays and confirmed his preference for climbing alone or with a few companions.Mr. Beckey was caught in shrieking gales, trapped on rock ledges and buried in avalanches. But he was rarely hurt seriously, a testament perhaps to fine judgments: How to cross a snowfield that might conceal a crevasse? Where to hammer a piton into rock or ice to secure a rope on which life might hang? Where to cling or step when hugging a sheer vertical rock face over an abyss?Wolfgang Beckey was born on Jan. 14, 1923, near D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, to Klaus and Marta Maria Beckey. His father was a surgeon and his mother an opera singer.The family, including a brother, Helmut, emigrated to Seattle in 1925. The boy called himself Fred and learned climbing techniques as a Boy Scout and in a Mountaineers course.He is survived by his brother, who Ms. Bond said lives in Germany.At 13, Fred and two friends reached the top of Mount Despair, a rugged 7,292-foot peak in the North Cascades that mountaineers had considered unclimbable. He soon began making local history climbing summits in the Olympic and North Cascade ranges.He loved skiing, and in 1942 he joined the wartime Army\u2019s 10th Mountain Division, based in Colorado. After the war, he attended the University of Washington, but spent most of his time with his brother and friends scaling peaks in Washington, Wyoming, California and Oregon, the Bitterroots in Montana, the Bugaboos in British Columbia and desert rock formations in the Southwest.After graduating in 1949 with a degree in business administration, he sold ads for The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and was a print shop sales representative. He also finished his first book, \u201cClimber\u2019s Guide to the Cascade and Olympic Mountains of Washington\u201d (1949).Later books included \u201cChallenge of the North Cascades\u201d (1969); \u201cCascade Alpine Guide,\u201d a three-volume set with many editions (1973 to 2008); \u201cMountains of North America\u201d (1982); \u201cMount McKinley: Icy Crown of North America\u201d (1993); \u201cRange of Glaciers: The Exploration and Survey of the Northern Cascade Range\u201d (2003); and \u201cFred Beckey\u2019s 100 Favorite North American Climbs\u201d (2011).His home was plastered with photos of his conquests, including two named for him: Beckey\u2019s Spire, also known as Christianity Spire, in Sedona, Ariz., which he climbed in 1970, and Mount Beckey, an 8,500-foot Alaskan peak in the Cathedral Mountains, which he climbed in 1996.Friends called him a cantankerous cuss who hated talk about himself. He sped long distances in his old pink Thunderbird, screaming all night to stay awake at the wheel, and howled at tourists who gawked at his camps. On a mountain, he amazed fellow climbers with his uphill speed and stamina, even in his 80s.\u201cI guess you have your choice of trying to make money or getting involved with adventure,\u201d Mr. Beckey told Lincoln Stoller for the Learning Project in 2007. \u201cMost people get married, and by the time they\u2019re 30 they\u2019ve got a couple of kids, and then they\u2019re strapped down. Then they have to work.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this obituary omitted credit for the photograph of Mr. Beckey on an expedition to Mount Seattle in Alaska in 1966.

{"Headline": "Australian Soldiers \u2018Liked\u2019 Facebook Page That Joked About Rape", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 The Facebook page featured memes making light of rape, domestic violence and child sexual abuse \u2014 and at least 100 members of the Australian Defense Force, past and present, were found to have \u201cliked\u201d it.This week, the Victims of Abuse in the Australian Defense Force Association, an advocacy group, made public its research into the military-themed Facebook page, called Snafu. On the page, users had published memes and comments joking about rape, necrophilia and child sexual assault.In analyzing 8 percent of the page\u2019s fans, the association said it had identified more than 100 active and former members of the Australian military, as well as personnel from the armed forces of the United States, Singapore, South Africa, Belgium and Canada. The group also found that the page had been \u201cliked\u201d by an elected member of a City Council in South Australia.\u201cOne of the memes was that of a black-and-white photo of a young girl hanging herself,\u201d said Jennifer Jacomb, the advocacy group\u2019s secretary and public officer. \u201cAnd it reads, on the left-hand side, \u2018If you rape them correctly, you don\u2019t have to kill them \u2013 they\u2019ll kill themselves.\u2019\u201d Another meme joked about a child performing sexual acts on his father, Ms. Jacomb said.Screenshots made public by the advocacy group showed memes that used images of dead and mutilated children. The group said it did not know whether any Australian soldiers were among the page\u2019s administrators.The page, which had more than 30,000 \u201clikes\u201d early Tuesday, was taken down later in the day. Several Australian news organizations had published reports about it, and the page\u2019s administrators had posted an apology for what they called \u201cclearly offensive and disturbing\u201d content.The Australian Defense Force said through a spokesman that it had asked Facebook to take the page down, and that it was investigating whether any service members had engaged in unlawful or inappropriate use of social media.The advocacy group said it had shared its findings about the Snafu page with military and government representatives twice this year before bringing it to the news media.Ben Wadham, an associate professor in sociology at Flinders University in Adelaide and an army veteran, said that as distressing as the content of the page was, he was not surprised that it was followed by Australian service members.\u201cThis is what these boys are about,\u201d said Professor Wadham, who has studied misogyny in militaries globally. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing extraordinary about this stuff.\u201dLike other major militaries in recent years, the Australian Defense Force has seen numerous scandals over the mistreatment of women in its ranks. In 2011, an Australian Defense Force Academy member secretly filmed himself having sex with a female cadet, sending live video of the act to another male soldier over Skype.But Professor Wadham said that despite such efforts at the top, he had seen little determination to change misogynist attitudes in the lower ranks. \u201cIf the A.D.F. wants to be serious about protecting and upholding the principles of a liberal democracy, then it has to go to the core of the source of its own violence,\u201d he said.Professor Wadham said he had come out of the army \u201cwith a lot of questions about military culture.\u201d\u201cDespite the scandals that occurred quite regularly over the past 40 years, showing the misogyny and racism and queerphobia,\u201d he said, \u201cat the base of the Australian military, and I daresay most militaries, is a violent and oppressive core.\u201dProfessor Wadham was previously involved in exposing another Facebook group, called RAR Buddies, which posted sexist and racist content. He said that throughout his years of research into military culture in Australia, he has received hostile anonymous phone calls and death threats, and his home has been broken into.Asked whether he expected a stronger response to this episode, given that sexual harassment and abuse have been in the public eye since the Harvey Weinstein scandal in Hollywood, Professor Wadham was pessimistic.\u201cNot any more than usual,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like in the A.D.F., there\u2019s been a massive backlash against the gains that were made between 2011 and 2015, during its short experiment with gender equity. There\u2019s a shift happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering From Severe Anxiety?", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "FeatureParents, therapists and schools are struggling to figure out whether helping anxious teenagers means protecting them or pushing them to face their fears.Supported byNot coincidentally, failure was one of Jake\u2019s biggest fears. He worried about it privately; maybe he couldn\u2019t keep up with his peers, maybe he wouldn\u2019t succeed in life. The relentless drive to avoid such a fate seemed to come from deep inside him. He considered it a strength.Jake\u2019s parents knew he could be high-strung; in middle school, they sent him to a therapist when he was too scared to sleep in his own room. But nothing prepared them for the day two years ago when Jake, then 17, seemingly \u201cran 150 miles per hour into a brick wall,\u201d his mother said. He refused to go to school and curled up in the fetal position on the floor. \u201cI just can\u2019t take it!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand!\u201dJake was right \u2014 his parents didn\u2019t understand. Jake didn\u2019t really understand, either. But he also wasn\u2019t good at verbalizing what he thought he knew: that going to school suddenly felt impossible, that people were undoubtedly judging him, that nothing he did felt good enough. \u201cAll of a sudden I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so afraid.\u201d His tall, lanky frame succumbed, too. His stomach hurt. He had migraines. \u201cYou know how a normal person might have their stomach lurch if they walk into a classroom and there\u2019s a pop quiz?\u201d he told me. \u201cWell, I basically started having that feeling all the time.\u201dAlarmed, Jake\u2019s parents sent him to his primary-care physician, who prescribed Prozac, an antidepressant often given to anxious teenagers. It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work \u2014 and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake \u201cmuch more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,\u201d his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake\u2019s father wrote: \u201cJake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.\u201d A week later, though, Jake couldn\u2019t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse\u2019s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. \u201cIt was the depth of hell,\u201d his mother told me.Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing \u2014 and learning to talk back to \u2014 their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That\u2019s an easy exercise for anxious young people (\u201cOnly three?\u201d one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a \u201cstrong and powerful response\u201d to each negative thought.She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,\u201d Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, \u201cthen I\u2019ll get a bad grade in the class, I won\u2019t get into the college I want, I won\u2019t get a good job and I\u2019ll be a total failure.\u201dAt Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake\u2019s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn\u2019t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down \u2014 and that his value as a person didn\u2019t depend on where he went to school.Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn\u2019t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn\u2019t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.At the last one, Jillian\u2019s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.\u201cIf it\u2019s too much, you can stop,\u201d the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. \u201cNo, I feel like I need to do this,\u201d she announced. \u201cI have a week and a half left. If I can\u2019t get through something like this here ...\u201dHer voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing \u2014 and much less forgiving.\u201cAnxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,\u201d explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center\u2019s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: \u201cThe overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.\u201d\u201cThe fears can be very real for our kids,\u201d explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic\u2019s medical director. \u201cOftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there\u2019s a history of trauma and abuse.\u201d The contemporary political climate can also feel \u201cincredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,\u201d Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who \u201cact out\u201d are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves \u2014 anxiety specialists call them \u201csilent sufferers\u201d \u2014 are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. \u201cIf you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,\u201d Kendall says. \u201cWhen you start to talk about anxiety, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, those are the kids we like!\u2019\u2009\u201dTeenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. \u201cThese kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,\u201d she says, but there\u2019s \u201ccontempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.\u201dFor many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they \u201cnever get to the point where they can say, \u2018I\u2019ve done enough, and now I can stop,\u2019\u2009\u201d Luthar says. \u201cThere\u2019s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they\u2019re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. \u201cTeenagers used to tell me, \u2018I just need to get my parents off my back,\u2019\u2009\u201d recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. \u201cNow so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.\u201dThough there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there\u2019s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. \u201cThey wonder about whether it\u2019s safe to go to a movie theater,\u201d she said.When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn\u2019t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids\u2019 digital habits \u2014 round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers \u2014 were partly to blame for their children\u2019s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation\u2019s relationship to social media. \u201cI don\u2019t think we realize how much it\u2019s affecting our moods and personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media is a tool, but it\u2019s become this thing that we can\u2019t live without but that\u2019s making us crazy.\u201dWhile smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. \u201cIt was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,\u201d he said. Jake\u2019s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the \u201cillusion of control and certainty\u201d that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. \u201cTeens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who\u2019s checked in online,\u201d Ashworth told the parents. \u201cBut life doesn\u2019t always come with that kind of certainty, and they\u2019re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.\u201dJean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. \u201cIt seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn\u2019t much evidence for it,\u201d she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is \u201call wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy was improving by the time the increase started.\u201dMore than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to convince them anymore,\u201d she told me. \u201cSchools are coming to us, eager for help.\u201dA gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety \u201cthe cult leader\u201d \u2014 for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves \u2014 and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. \u201cAnxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,\u201d Lyons explained. \u201cWhen we play along, we don\u2019t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.\u201dShe pointed to the increasing use of \u201c504 plans,\u201d a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door \u2014 to avoid the chaos of the main entrance \u2014 and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are \u201cavoidance-based and teach zero skills.\u201d She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager \u201ccan go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,\u201d she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student \u201cexternalize his worry,\u201d similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.\u201cIf anxiety could talk, it would say, \u2018You know, let\u2019s just get out of here. We don\u2019t have to do this!\u2019\u2009\u201d Lyons said from the stage. \u201cBut in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I\u2019m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they\u2019re so frail, like they can\u2019t handle things.\u201dLyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces \u2014 and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. \u201cKids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can\u2019t handle being triggered, that they shouldn\u2019t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,\u201d she told me.Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word \u2014 \u201cresiliency\u201d \u2014 kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren\u2019t \u201cequipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,\u201d a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety \u2014 and as more of those \u201cstop coming to school, because they just can\u2019t.\u201dSome schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called \u201cour more fragile students.\u201d At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch\u2019s painting \u201cThe Scream.\u201d These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck \u2014 not that anyone was keeping score.I couldn\u2019t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs\u2019 teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?\u201cSome will say that this feeds the monster,\u201d concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We\u2019ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don\u2019t come to school if they have to spend all day in\u201d general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury\u2019s regular classes \u2014 and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program\u2019s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program\u2019s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to \u201csacrifice the anxious kid\u201d in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. \u201cWhat\u2019s the issue today?\u201d I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a \u201cHail Mary,\u201d as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone \u201cright next to his face,\u201d he rarely responds when he\u2019s feeling anxious. \u201cI appreciate you picking up \u2014 you don\u2019t normally do that,\u201d Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to \u201chide from, control and avoid\u201d their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.Critelli looked at him incredulously. \u201cDude, you\u2019re failing physics,\u201d Critelli said. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have anything to do?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do \u2014 I\u2019m going to fail,\u201d the student mumbled.\u201cSo you\u2019re just accepting that you\u2019re going to fail?\u201d The boy looked at his hands. \u201cHere\u2019s an idea,\u201d Critelli continued. \u201cYou can email your teacher and say, \u2018What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?\u2019\u2009\u201dCritelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you advocate for yourselves!\u201dWhile he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. \u201cThat was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn\u2019t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,\u201d he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had \u201caced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.\u201d But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. \u201cJust being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCollege is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.\u201dThe doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn\u2019t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a \u201cWalking Dead\u201d costume contest at a local car dealership.While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series\u2019s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. \u201cI\u2019d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them were like, \u2018Just kill yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201dNothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn\u2019t want to open up and be known as \u201cthe anxious girl.\u201d There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,\u201d the headmaster told me \u2014 but Jillian didn\u2019t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backward,\u201d she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. \u201cThere\u2019s feeling a weight on your chest, and there\u2019s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as I\u2019d wake up, it was absolute dread.\u201dNeeding to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother \u2014 who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support \u2014 could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn\u2019t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn\u2019t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was \u201cmanipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn\u2019t feel like doing,\u201d she said.\u201cThe million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she\u2019s going to have a panic attack?\u201d Allison told me. \u201cI feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.\u201dHe also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children\u2019s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they\u2019ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they\u2019re afraid to. \u201cSo many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,\u201d Ashworth said.While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a \u201clet\u2019s not take life \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 too seriously\u201d approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, \u201cyou\u2019ve just made his day,\u201d Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn\u2019t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn\u2019t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. \u201cWe basically said, \u2018O.K., anxiety, you win.\u2019\u2009\u201dJillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. \u201cI\u2019m just a lot more relaxed now,\u201d she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with \u201cStar Wars\u201d posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of \u201cChicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.\u201d Near her bed were two prescription bottles \u2014 one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be \u201ca lot worse if I wasn\u2019t taking them.\u201dThough she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule \u2014 including yoga, studying and cleaning her room \u2014 that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at \u201cStar Wars\u201d conventions or on social media.At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.\u201cO.K., I\u2019m going to go mingle,\u201d she announced.But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. \u201cWe\u2019re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,\u201d says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cAnd when we do give them therapy, it\u2019s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we\u2019re not treating people with what actually works best.\u201dPart of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren\u2019t typically eager to feel more anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s also uncomfortable for many therapists,\u201d Whiteside told me. \u201cMost people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you\u2019re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s not much fun for anybody. It\u2019s much easier to sit in a therapist\u2019s office and talk about feelings.\u201dFor two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.\u201cEven better \u2014 let\u2019s make it weird,\u201d Randolph told him.The boy shook his head. \u201cMaybe the guy\u2019s on break and doesn\u2019t want to be bothered.\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cHe might hate you. He might get real mad at you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s terrifying,\u201d the teenager confessed. \u201cAnd what if we\u2019re so close on the bench that we\u2019re touching?\u201d\u201cThat would be awkward,\u201d Randolph said with a half-smile.The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. \u201cIs he sitting in the middle of the bench?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 he might be,\u201d Randolph told him. \u201cBut are you going to \u2018what if\u2019 this to death, or are you going to do it?\u201dHe eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: \u201cI\u2019ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.\u201d The \u201cAsk Me\u201d was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including \u201cB*tch,\u201d \u201cF*ggot,\u201d \u201cUr Fat\u201d and \u201cKill Yourself.\u201d Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas\u2019s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas\u2019s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. \u201cOh, my God, that was the greatest,\u201d Thomas announced upon his return.I asked him what they\u2019d talked about. \u201cThe muscular dude said he\u2019s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,\u201d Thomas told us. \u201cThen the girl said, \u2018You\u2019re really brave. Can I give you a hug?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what you were expecting, huh?\u201d Randolph said. \u201cInstead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.\u201d\u201cYeah, it was awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel so good!\u201d\u201cAnd what if he was?\u201d Randolph asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for what he\u2019s thinking.\u201dThe boy appeared to consider Randolph\u2019s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, \u201cexactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it\u2019s all manageable.\u201dLast month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. \u201cThe health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,\u201d he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home \u2014 and some of his peers from Mountain Valley \u2014 via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. \u201cMy junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn\u2019t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think like that anymore.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that Jake doesn\u2019t study. He does \u2014 usually days before he needs to. \u201cProcrastination isn\u2019t a good idea for me,\u201d he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato\u2019s \u201cRepublic.\u201dJake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn\u2019t gone through. He said he felt \u201ca sudden burst of anxiety\u201d \u2014 his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was \u201cfreaking out.\u201d Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cThat ended that crisis,\u201d Jake told me.For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university\u2019s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. \u201cI just haven\u2019t felt like I need it here,\u201d Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: \u201cI know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.\u201dI was curious how much of Jake\u2019s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn\u2019t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. \u201cI would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot\u2019s changed.\u201dBefore walking back to his dorm, where Jake\u2019s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A\u2019s that semester. The old Jake might have been first in line. But the new Jake? He hadn\u2019t bothered to show up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Complain Is to Truly Be Alive", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThere are so many things in daily life that cause me never-ending unease: waiting in the kind of loosely defined wraparound line at the D.M.V. that makes losing your place inevitable; self-service situations whose unmarked rules the savage among us approach \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d-style, leaving, say, the Starbucks condiment bar in complete disarray in their wake; holding my breath while hoping for the woman two stalls down to hurry up and leave as she hopes for me to hurry up and do the exact same thing.Then there are the minor tragedies that cause me deep, unrelenting angst every moment I\u2019m awake. I hate trying to sign a credit card slip that is so slippery the pen just leaves weird scratch marks as I melt into a molten puddle of anxiety because I\u2019m holding up the line at the store. I hate when someone comes to my house unannounced and I have to sit real still in the corner of the room you can\u2019t see from the window because I don\u2019t want anyone to know what the cats and I wear when we watch TV. I hate when I\u2019m trying to walk into a building at the same time as another person and we both go through the \u201cwait, I\u2019m polite, too\u201d motions that result in an awkward reach-in-and-retract dance that can come to an end only when one of us drops dead on the sidewalk. The potential for me to be utterly humiliated lies in wait around every corner of my life.Which is why I love to complain. Why are people so terrible at merging on the highway? When is my neighbor going to cut down that rotting tree limb or does it have to shatter my windshield before he notices how bad it\u2019s getting? How is my phone bill this expensive every month? Where has Barack Obama been? Who turned the thermostat down to 68 degrees? Why does everyone pretend to be cool with splitting a huge check when I just had club soda and you had four overpriced top-shelf cocktails, Kelly?Being a person is terrible. And complaining about it is the purest, most soothing form of protest there is. Complaining feels so good. It\u2019s like casting off the oppressive wool coat you\u2019ve been buried under since October on that first truly beautiful warm April day. Pointlessly yelling into the void about some minor injustice you\u2019ve suffered is the perfect relief for the giant wave of anxiety crashing against your insides, a balm for the wounds that riding public transportation with people who don\u2019t use headphones while they listen to music can inflict upon your weary soul.It doesn\u2019t even have to be verbal. The shared grimace and eye roll between me and the other woman who was inconvenienced by the oversize suitcase the man in Seat 3B tried to sneak past the flight attendant can feel better than a long hug. Complaining is a hot bath for your feelings.I spent 17 soul-crushing \u2014 I mean, backbone-strengthening? \u2014 years in customer service. Or, as I often lovingly refer to it, being held hostage as the helpless sounding board for people\u2019s misdirected rage. And then complaining about people\u2019s complaints to my friends over drinks at happy hour, where a tab full of half-priced margaritas bought me at least an hour of incredulous \u201cAnd then can you believe that she had the nerve to say that?\u201dFourteen of those years were spent manning the front desk of a suburban animal hospital, a place where puppies and kittens get their shots and also where a high school gym teacher once spent 15 minutes telling me how his taxes are too high. I sat 10 feet from the door, the first human most people encountered on a day they\u2019d chosen to wrestle a cat into a homemade knit cardigan to get its teeth cleaned in December.I wasn\u2019t really a person to them, I was a talking garbage can into which they could deposit their complaints \u2014 problems that had little to do either with me or with the overpriced foods no one was making them purchase for their $2,500 purebred dogs. I was a blank slate at which someone\u2019s sweet, cookie-baking grandmother could toss casual insults phrased as pleasant inquiries about the quality of my day. \u201cWorking hard?\u201d she would ask, barely concealing her disdain at my half-empty coffee cup.I understood what was up, though. Sometimes you just want to tell another person that your head hurts, and your lunch was cold, and the minivan broke down. It\u2019s another way to connect.I have spent too long listening to other people\u2019s problems, though, to casually drop my own on the innocent bystander who just happens to be waiting for the same bus. Who is more deserving of the accumulated disappointments of my day, the 20-year-old UPS guy juggling my fragile packages and his hand-held computer on my porch in the rain or my friend\u2019s racist uncle prattling nonsensically on Facebook about the \u201cboys\u201d kneeling on the field?This is the beauty of the time in which we live: Everything is terrible, no one is happy, and now we have more outlets than ever into which we can spew the litany of meaningless trespasses against us.Complaining is like spreading lotion on dry skin, and 2017 has been the ashiest year in recent memory. There is more than ever to complain about and also more reason than ever to believe your complaints might actually do something.Resist the urge to unload your economic anxieties on the dry cleaner and instead make a video about it or write one of those long statuses everyone is just going to scroll past anyway. Then, when you\u2019re all wrung out, when you feel that you don\u2019t have a single complaint left, dredge up a few more and call your member of Congress. That way you can at least try to turn your seething rage into affordable health care.Advertisement"}

As he took portraits on streets, in cafes and at beachside nightclubs, he sought to make the people shine, while also spotlighting the action in the background.In July, Jake Michaels spent a week in Senegal, documenting contemporary and traditional styles. He was traveling with his girlfriend, Juliette Ballay, and Francine Awa Pipien, who helped them get to know people and places around Dakar, the capital. Spontaneity is key for Mr. Michaels. When he took this photo, he wanted to capture the action in the background \u2014 the little girl peeking around the doorway. It helped give the photo context, he said, \u201cand I think that that is just as valuable as the person in the photograph.\u201d\u201cShe puts a couple of new elements in fashion into her dress, but they\u2019re not flashy things,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting seeing her blend the old and the new.\u201dThis photo was taken in St.-Louis, a port city on the Senegal River, north of Dakar. The city was once the French colonial capital. \u201cYou can see the skeleton of the colonization,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.This scene reminded him of a movie set, and he was attracted to the color palette. \u201cThe blue dress jumps off the page in comparison,\u201d he said.St.-Louis, which is on the border with Mauritania, is just south of the Sahara. \u201cWhen you go north of there, it just becomes desert,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.Yoro sells gold jewelry at a market where people buy clothing and accessories in the Plateau neighborhood of Dakar. \u201cThe soccer jersey seemed to be a really present style of dress with a lot of the younger males in Senegal,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.Yoro was more than happy to pose. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Go right away, take my picture,\u2019\u201d Mr. Michaels said.

Few young women in Senegal wear henna these days, Ms. Pipien said. \u201cIt\u2019s her way of paying homage to this old tradition she used to see her grandmothers doing,\u201d she said.\u201cOlivia is inspired by the old tradition,\u201d she said, \u201cand she really likes to rearrange it.\u201dThis man, \u201ca friend of a friend of a friend,\u201d showed up while Mr. Michaels was on the campus of Cheikh Anta Diop University.Toward the end of his trip, Mr. Michaels went to Sea Plaza, a mall in Dakar, after sunset. \u201cThese four skateboard kids came in and started skating,\u201d he said. The boys, who wore headphones, spoke English to one another. English, Mr. Michaels learned, is part of the skate culture in Dakar.This young man worked at the mall and had taken a break to join his friends. \u201cHe was embarrassed because he\u2019s not wearing skate shoes,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.Mr. Michaels photographed Nafissatou Diop, a screenwriter, at an open-air nightclub near the beach in Dakar. When he took this photo, it was only the beginning of the night. \u201cThe party starts at midnight and goes till the sunrise,\u201d he said. He wanted to capture Ms. Diop in this quiet moment \u2014 \u201cthe calm before the storm.\u201d But in the end, he said: \u201cIt was such a different experience than I\u2019ve had in any nightclub anywhere. Everyone there is having fun, and nobody\u2019s judging anybody.\u201dPaco, a painter, lives in St.-Louis. When Ms. Ballay asked Paco if they could take his photo, he took them to his home, where he showed them his work.\u201cYou can tell that is a traditional colonial courtyard,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. \u201cI thought it was interesting to see the shell of the past with the bright red outfit.\u201dHe considered Paco\u2019s handmade wardrobe to be the most \u201crelaxed\u201d of all of the looks he saw in Senegal, sneakers included. Fatou, a student, on Route de la Corniche, a seaside road in Dakar, was pleased when Mr. Michaels asked to photograph her.\u201cThe smile on her face when we said that we liked her style \u2014 her whole day was worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said it was the best thing she\u2019d hear all day.\u201dInside, it was \u201cabout 120 degrees,\u201d Mr. Michaels recalled. Mr. Doye, who is part of the L\u00e9bou ethnic group, showed them a tarp covering some rocks that he\u2019d used in a ceremony. \u201cHe told me, \u2018We just did an exorcism,\u2019\u201d Mr. Michaels said.

Underneath is a white woman in a light shirt.The ad, a three-second GIF, featured three women, each removing her shirt to reveal the next.The outcry to the Dove ad, which was posted last week, was swift, with many social media users wondering how it could have made it through multiple layers of review.On Saturday, Dove \u2014 owned by Unilever \u2014 apologized, writing on Facebook: \u201cDove is committed to representing the beauty of diversity. In an image we posted this week, we missed the mark in thoughtfully representing women of color and we deeply regret the offense that it has caused.\u201dMarissa Solan, a spokeswoman for Dove, said on Sunday that the GIF \u201cwas intended to convey that Dove Body Wash is for every woman and be a celebration of diversity, but we got it wrong and, as a result, offended many people.\u201dShe added that Dove had removed the post and was \u201cre-evaluating our internal processes for creating and reviewing content.\u201d She declined to say how many people reviewed the ad or whether any of them were African-American.Critics were unimpressed by the company\u2019s apology.\u201cWhat was the mark?\u201d the Facebook user Ariel Macklin wrote in a comment that was liked more than 1,100 times. \u201cI mean anyone with eyes can see how offensive this is. Not one person on your staff objected to this? Wow. Will not be buying your products anymore.\u201dDove\u2019s ad was not an isolated case by one company, but the latest in a long line of tone-deaf ads by many companies.Here are a few examples from the past.Intel said its intent \u201cwas to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,\u201d but acknowledged, \u201cUnfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.\u201dIn 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d; the \u201cbefore\u201d sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the \u201cafter\u201d sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.\u201cVisibly more beautiful skin,\u201d the ad read.The fact that the most recent ad was Dove\u2019s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters \u2014 including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous \u201cspirit it was intended.\u201d Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: \u201cOur team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs.

I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.\u201dA spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. \u201cWe did this for some sensational effect,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cIf we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.\u201dA representative of Nivea\u2019s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had \u201cnever intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.\u201dBut, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Girls, Don\u2019t Become Boy Scouts", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe responses fell into a few broadly predictable categories. Some applauded what they saw as a long-overdue opening of closed doors, along the lines of the January announcement that transgender boys could join scouting and the 2013 end to the ban on gay members. Others, mostly men, many of them former scouts, objected to what they saw as creeping political correctness, an incursion of unwanted female influence into an all-male bastion. On Fox News, Laura Ingraham attributed the change to a \u201csmall, radical group of gender-benders.\u201dBut both sides seemed to agree that the shift in policy, whether they loved it or hated it, was essentially progressive. They\u2019ve been had.Unlike the Boy Scouts, in which individual troops are overwhelmingly affiliated with churches \u2014 a large share are tied to conservative denominations; an estimated 20 percent of scouts are Mormon, for instance \u2014 the Girl Scouts are a secular organization. While the Boy Scouts have an official policy against atheists and agnostics participating in scouting, the Girl Scouts make it clear that girls may substitute any words they like for the part of the Girl Scout Pledge in which they promise \u201cto serve God.\u201dThe Girl Scouts have long focused on social justice, diversity and inclusion in their activities. And as members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, a global body, they have provided financial support to organizations like Oxfam, Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders. Feminist icons routinely recall their Girl Scout days as a source of strength and confidence that launched them into lives of purpose.As a result, the Girl Scouts have become a sort of boogeyman for conservatives. In May of this year, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas announced it was cutting ties with the Girl Scouts, choosing instead to partner with American Heritage Girls, a right-leaning scouting group. Some anti-abortion organizations have even gone so far as to boycott the Girl Scouts\u2019 trademark \u2014 and delicious \u2014 cookies.In making this change, the Boy Scouts aren\u2019t pursuing some kind of radical coed style of scouting. What has been lost in the discussion is that by all accounts, the plan wouldn\u2019t so much let girls in as form separate girls\u2019 wings \u2014 a sort of junior ladies\u2019 auxiliary \u2014 for girls whose families shy away from the scary, liberal, feminist Girl Scouts. The Boy Scouts\u2019 statement hints as much, promising that they want \u201cto offer families an important additional choice in meeting the character development needs of all their children.\u201d This sounds benevolent, until you remember that there already is an organization that helps girls develop character: the Girl Scouts.There are real conversations to be had about single-sex youth organizations, and hard questions we ought to face about the role religion, race and class play in them as well. But this situation isn\u2019t really all that complicated, at least not from the point of view of this former Brownie: There\u2019s nothing progressive about trying to undercut a venerable organization that serves girls. And there\u2019s nothing so cynical as a corporate strategy dressed up to look like empowerment.Kate Tuttle is a book critic and essayist.Advertisement"}

The airline said it did not have a policy regarding the singing of the national anthem on its planes.Dr. Gaudry, who said she was the wife of a Navy captain who died in the line of duty, said in the video that not singing was \u201cthe most uncourageous thing\u201d she had done in her life.\u201cI\u2019m humiliated by my lack of courage to sing the national anthem in my own country, on American soil, with a deceased soldier on the plane,\u201d she said in the video.But the doctor did receive her second wish, as the video was viewed more than a million times on Facebook and picked up by news outlets around the country. Dr. Gaudry did not immediately return phone messages requesting an interview Tuesday morning.In response to questions about the doctor\u2019s video, the airline said that a Delta honor guard, a group of employees, many of whom are veterans, volunteer to greet every plane that carries a fallen soldier at the airport in Atlanta, as well as those in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles and Washington.The captain asked that the other passengers remain seated while the coffin, which had been accompanied by another soldier on the flight, was taken off the plane by an honor guard.Dr. Gaudry said that she had been inspired to sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d as the soldier left the plane and the coffin was carried out. She asked other passengers to do the same, and some agreed, she said.As the plane started to descend, she said on the video that a flight attendant told her that it was against company policy to proceed with the singing.A second announcement was made, asking that passengers be quiet as the soldier left the plane to accompany the coffin, Dr. Gaudry said. The announcement did not mention that singing the national anthem was against company policy.\u201cWe all sat in silence as the honor guard took the soldier off the plane,\u201d Dr. Gaudry said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Apple Pie That Lasts for Days", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGone so soon?That\u2019s the question I always ask in the aftermath of a pie.Having nurtured a pie through all those steps \u2014 the mixing and the chilling and the rolling and the filling \u2014 I expect the relationship to last longer than one meal. It rarely does.But since it is unbecoming to hide alone with your pie, or to glare at loved ones when they ask for seconds, here is a solution: make a bigger pie.Nine-inch pie pans were standard back when many American households went through a pie or more a day. Pie was a staple for many farm families in all seasons, made with fresh or dried fruit, pecans or hickory nuts, sometimes crackers or condensed milk in lean times.Those cooks made pie as routinely as we make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Pie-making today is more of a project, so I wanted a recipe for an apple pie of unusual size that justified the effort. It had to be large enough to feed a crowd, with at least some leftovers; make a dent in the bags of apples I cannot stop buying and picking in the fall; and provide the thick, flaky bites of pie crust that small pies rarely deliver.To me, pie crust is a sublime food in itself, and there\u2019s never enough of it. Crust is not supposed to be as thin as phyllo dough, or even as thin as gingerbread cookie dough. Once baked, the double-wide rim of this giant apple pie is as thick as a finger of shortbread, and just as delicious.Many modern recipes call for a crust that is an eighth-inch thick. But Ms. McDermott rolls out her crusts to at least a quarter-inch, a more traditional proportion.Those crusts were not necessarily meant to be eaten. To this day, a good pie must have a stable marriage of filling and crust.To achieve this, a fully baked, not-soggy crust is essential. A sturdy crust (like the one on a baguette) can often be chewy and tough. The genius of the traditional method for making pie crust \u2014 with large, flat flakes of flour and butter \u2014 is that, once baked, it is both strong and tender.A thick crust demands a heavy, heat-conducting dish. Thin metal does not provide the even, steady heat that\u2019s needed to cook this crust through. Thick glass is fine if you want to check the color of the crust, but heavy ceramics (like stoneware, earthenware and porcelain) are actually better at browning, according to Ms. McDermott. Her trick of baking the pie on a preheated baking sheet (to ensure that heat reaches the crust quickly) means that there\u2019s no reason to doubt that the bottom crust is cooked when the other signs of doneness (bubbling filling, brown top crust) are there.However, you do not need a pie pan to bake a pie, especially a deep-dish pie. The sloped sides of a traditional pie dish are there to make it easier to slice and serve, but they are certainly not necessary. Any baking dish of any shape can be used, as long as it is at least two inches deep and holds 2\u00bd to 3 quarts. Use your most-loved casserole or cast-iron skillet. Your favorite dish may not have a rim, but you don\u2019t need one \u2014 this pie\u2019s crust is thick enough to make its own.And which apples? A pie made with a dozen Granny Smith apples may be inedible, but a pie made with four Granny Smith apples may be irresistible. Generally, a mix of tart and sweet apples gives the best odds of a great filling. Though some claim that ancient breeds like sweet Bramleys and tart Pippins make the best pies, many of the newer apples on the market \u2014 Honeycrisps and Pink Ladys, Ginger Golds and Cameos \u2014 offer a good balance of sweet and tart.\u201cCrispness has become super-valued,\u201d he said.An interplay of sweet and sour flavors, plus firm and soft textures, is the goal. \u201cYou need the mortar and you need the bricks,\u201d Mr. Jacobsen said of a good filling. If using crunchy apples, toss in a McIntosh, Idared or Cortland. Those apples will break down during baking and bind the filling. (A spoonful of applesauce will do the same thing.)And when it comes to maximizing apple flavor, Ms. McDermott takes no chances, boosting it at every opportunity. Instead of lemon juice, commonly added to balance the sweetness of added sugar, she uses unfiltered apple cider vinegar; she also deploys a shot of apple liqueur, schnapps or brandy, like French Calvados. Cider syrup, apple cider and apple juice are perfectly fine nonalcoholic alternatives.\u201cPie is very forgiving,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is happy as long as it is made.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

Ultimately, whether from tech companies or Congress, what people want is more transparency.The company also should make its executives readily available to the press, and they should spend time on Capitol Hill to explain their decision-making.Everyone understands that new technology platforms are not perfect, and that bad actors find ways to abuse them.

If it does that, it will continue to earn the public\u2019s trust.Chief executive of Upworthy and author of \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201dFacebook should open itself up for independent research. Right now, Facebook is a black box: It\u2019s very difficult, and in many cases impossible, for researchers to independently look at behavior on the platform. While opening private data to research creates risks, there\u2019s a ton of explicitly public data on the platform that Facebook makes difficult to query at scale. Facebook could also open up many of the tools advertisers currently use for free use by research scientists. It would be a bold move for transparency, and one that would help us understand much better what\u2019s happening on the world\u2019s most important social platform. And it\u2019d be wise to do this before regulators forced them to.Early Facebook employee who recounted her time at the company in her book, \u201cThe Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network.\u201dIt would be interesting if Facebook offered a \u201cvintage Facebook\u201d setting that users could toggle to, without News Feed ads and \u201clike\u201d buttons.

This would increase the diversity of items in the News Feed, and would make it more likely that users were exposed to people and information that didn\u2019t support their own confirmation bias.It should also greatly increase the human oversight of ad targeting systems \u2014 specifically, oversee algorithmically generated categories (rather than basing them solely on user-inputted interests). Political and interest-based advertising should be under much stricter scrutiny than, say, the advertising of T-shirts or hair products.Chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact and a former chief executive of Reddit.Adviser and former news executive at NPR, NBC News and Twitter.The single most important thing Facebook must do is come clean. Tell us what you know. Tell us what you know but can\u2019t share. Tell us what you don\u2019t know. And tell us what you don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t know. Stop hiding behind bromides like \u201cwe are not a media company.\u201d That makes us think you don\u2019t understand you have a serious set of problems that need fixing. Coming clean may not be the only thing, and may not be the main thing, but it\u2019s the first thing.Professor at Columbia Law School and author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201dFacebook should become a public benefit corporation. These companies must aim to do something that would aid the public, and board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook\u2019s goals are \u201cbringing us closer together\u201d and \u201cbuilding a global community.\u201d Worthy, beautiful goals, but easier said than done when Facebook is also stuck delivering ever-increasing profits and making its platform serve the needs of advertisers.Advertisement"}

The group has become one of the most influential transnational Sunni Muslim movements in the world.Mr. Ramadan teaches contemporary Islamic studies at Oxford University and is the author of a dozen books in English on modern Islam and the Western world.A familiar figure at conferences and in the news media, he is also a major presence on social media, with two million Facebook friends and more than 200,000 followers on Twitter.Asked about the latest allegations, his lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, said he had not been informed, Le Monde reported.Ms. Ayari, 40, said she had been corresponding with Mr. Ramadan on Facebook and had often asked him for advice on religion, until one day he proposed a meeting at the hotel where she said she was attacked.The author had written about the assault in her book \u201cI Chose to Be Free,\u201d an account published in 2016 of how she been drawn to Salafism, a radical Islamist ideology, and then fought to break away from it.

Senators Want to Know Why.", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth of Oregon\u2019s senators have demanded an explanation after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in plain clothes entered a home in Portland without a warrant and arrested a man who was later released.The video, which is more than seven minutes long, begins after three ICE agents are already inside the house. One of them asks the man, identified by the senators as Carlos Bolanos, for his identification. The man asks why.\u201cI have reason to believe you are not in the country legally,\u201d the agent replies.The co-worker recording the cellphone video, George Cardenas, then asks the agents why his colleague is being arrested and what the charges are, but none are specified. He asks them repeatedly to identify themselves and tells the agents they are trespassing, but the one agent who speaks throughout the encounter says the house is a place of business, apparently because the two men are working inside.Mr. Cardenas says that the homeowners live in the furnished basement, and points out their car.\u201cIf you guys don\u2019t have a warrant, you\u2019re kind of breaking the law,\u201d Mr. Cardenas said. \u201cWell, you are breaking the law, basically, at this point.\u201dThe video records a back and forth over access, and Mr. Cardenas agrees that he opened the door when he saw the agents outside but says he did not give them permission to enter. At one point, the agent says, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to introduce ourselves by our names.\u201dAfter several minutes, the agents arrest Mr. Bolanos, removing a paintbrush from one hand and a cellphone from the other and then placing his hands behind his back and handcuffing him. He is walked to a car outside.An ICE public affairs officer, Yasmeen Pitts O\u2019Keefe, said later that Mr. Bolanos was released from custody pending further investigation. She said in a statement that the matter had been referred to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General.\u201cThe agency is reviewing this incident,\u201d Ms. Pitts O\u2019Keefe said. She did not reply to a request for further comment on Monday.In their letter to Elizabeth Godfrey, a deputy field office director for ICE, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Merkley wrote that people \u201cdo not lose their constitutional protection from warrantless search and seizure simply because ICE believes they may be immigrants.\u201dThe senators asked Ms. Godfrey for an explanation of the policies that led to Mr. Bolanos\u2019s arrest and questioned whether the behavior of the agents conformed to guidelines. Mr. Cardenas said on Monday that Mr. Bolanos planned to speak with a lawyer before talking publicly about the episode.Mr. Andrade-Tafolla was asked to show his identification by agents who did not identify themselves, but who showed him a photograph. Mr. Andrade-Tafolla said that it was not him in the photograph, and that the only resemblance was skin color.\u201cWe have heard story after story,\u201d Representative Suzanne Bonamici said at the news conference in September.\u201cWithout a response, we will assume that an investigation into the Washington County incident is not underway,\u201d the lawmakers said. \u201cNow after this most recent incident, it is even more disturbing to witness ICE agents act inappropriately again, only a month later.\u201dMat Dos Santos, the legal director for the A.C.L.U. of Oregon, said in an interview over the weekend that the arrest of Mr. Bolanos, as seen in the video, was \u201cflagrantly unconstitutional.\u201d\u201cI hope that they review this incident and realize just how bad it is and how plainly illegal this arrest was and reprimand and retrain officers on how to conduct an arrest legally,\u201d he added.\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of hope for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an agency that operates largely in secret and with little public oversight.\u201dJacey Fortin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Is Not Your Friend", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "Such a somber, self-critical statement hasn\u2019t been typical for the usually sunny Mr. Zuckerberg, who once exhorted his employees at Facebook to \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d In the past, why would Mr. Zuckerberg, or any of his peers, have felt the need to atone for what they did at the office? For making incredibly cool sites that seamlessly connect billions of people to their friends as well as to a global storehouse of knowledge?Lately, however, the sins of Silicon Valley-led disruption have become impossible to ignore.Almost from its inception, the World Wide Web produced public anxiety \u2014 your computer was joined to a network that was beyond your ken and could send worms, viruses and trackers your way \u2014 but we nonetheless were inclined to give these earnest innovators the benefit of the doubt. They were on our side in making the web safe and useful, and thus it became easy to interpret each misstep as an unfortunate accident on the path to digital utopia rather than as subterfuge meant to ensure world domination.Now that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the questions of the hour are, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is? And do we still have the regulatory tools and social cohesion to restrain the monopolists before they smash the foundations of our society?To illustrate their point, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page boasted of the purity of their search engine\u2019s results for the query \u201ccellular phone\u201d; near the top was a study explaining the danger of driving while on the phone. The Google prototype was still ad-free, but what about the others, which took ads? Mr. Brin and Mr. Page had their doubts: \u201cWe expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201dThere was a crucial need for \u201ca competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm,\u201d and Google was set to be that ivory tower internet tool. Until, that is, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page were swept up by the entrepreneurism pervasive to Stanford \u2014 a meeting with a professor led to a meeting with an investor, who wrote a $100,000 check before Google was even a company. In 1999, Google announced a $25 million investment of venture capital while insisting nothing had changed. When Mr. Brin was asked by reporters how Google planned to make money, he replied, \u201cOur goal is to maximize the search experience, not maximize the revenues from search.\u201dSeven years later, Mr. Zuckerberg, too, had succumbed to Silicon Valley venture capital, but he seemed to regret it. \u201cIf I were starting now,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2011, \u201cI just would have stayed in Boston, I think,\u201d before adding: \u201cThere are aspects of the culture out here where I think it still is a little bit short-term focused in a way that bothers me. You know, whether it\u2019s like people who want to start companies to start a company, not knowing what they like, I don\u2019t know, to, like, flip it.\u201dUltimately, however, the founders of Google and Facebook faced a day of reckoning. Investors hadn\u2019t signed on for a charity, and they demanded accountability. In the end, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page agreed under pressure to display advertising alongside search results and eventually to allow an outside chief executive, Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to include ads within the news feed and transferred a favorite programmer to the mobile-advertising business, telling him, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fun to build a billion-dollar business in six months?\u201dTurns out that there were billion-dollar fortunes to be made by exploiting the foggy relationship between the public and tech companies. We all knew there was no such thing as a free lunch, an insight memorably encapsulated in 2010 by a commenter to the website MetaFilter, as, \u201cIf you are not paying for it, you\u2019re not the customer; you\u2019re the product being sold.\u201d But, really, how can you tell? So much of what is happening between the public and Silicon Valley is out of view \u2014 algorithms written and controlled by wizards who are able to extract value from your identity in ways you could never do for yourself.Eliza understood nothing, in truth, and could never reach any shared insight with a \u201cpatient.\u201d Eliza mechanically responded to whatever appeared on the screen. A typical therapy session quickly devolved into a Monty Python sketch. (Patient: You are not very aggressive, but I think you don\u2019t want me to notice that. Eliza: What makes you think I am not very aggressive? Patient: You don\u2019t argue with me. Eliza: Why do you think I don\u2019t argue with you? Patient: You are afraid of me. Eliza: Does it please you to believe I am afraid of you?)Imagine Mr. Weizenbaum\u2019s surprise when his secretary looked up from her computer and interrupted her exchanges with Eliza to say to him, \u201cWould you mind leaving the room, please?\u201d She wanted privacy for a conversation with a machine! Mr. Weizenbaum, appalled, suddenly saw the potential for mischief by programmers who could manipulate computers and potentially the rest of us. He soon switched gears and devoted his remaining years to protesting what he considered the amorality of his computer science peers, frequently referring to his experiences as a young refugee from Nazi Germany.In his epic anti-A.I. work from the mid-1970s, \u201cComputer Power and Human Reason,\u201d Mr. Weizenbaum described the scene at computer labs. \u201cBright young men of disheveled appearance, often with sunken glowing eyes, can be seen sitting at computer consoles, their arms tensed and waiting to fire their fingers, already poised to strike, at the buttons and keys on which their attention seems to be as riveted as a gambler\u2019s on the rolling dice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey exist, at least when so engaged, only through and for the computers. These are computer bums, compulsive programmers.\u201dHe was concerned about them as young students lacking perspective about life and was worried that these troubled souls could be our new leaders. Neither Mr. Weizenbaum nor Mr. McCarthy mentioned, though it was hard to miss, that this ascendant generation were nearly all white men with a strong preference for people just like themselves. In a word, they were incorrigible, accustomed to total control of what appeared on their screens. \u201cNo playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful,\u201d Mr. Weizenbaum wrote, \u201chas ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or a field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.\u201dWelcome to Silicon Valley, 2017.As Mr. Weizenbaum feared, the current tech leaders have discovered that people trust computers and have licked their lips at the possibilities. The examples of Silicon Valley manipulation are too legion to list: push notifications, surge pricing, recommended friends, suggested films, people who bought this also bought that. Early on, Facebook realized there was a hurdle to getting people to stay logged on. \u201cWe came upon this magic number that you needed to find 10 friends,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg recalled in 2011. \u201cAnd once you had 10 friends, you had enough content in your newsfeed that there would just be stuff on a good enough interval where it would be worth coming back to the site.\u201d Facebook would design its site for new arrivals so that it was all about finding people to \u201cfriend.\u201dThe 10 friends rule is an example of a favored manipulation of tech companies, the network effect. People will use your service \u2014 as lame as it may be \u2014 if others use your service. This was tautological reasoning that nonetheless proved true: If everyone is on Facebook, then everyone is on Facebook. You need to do whatever it takes to keep people logging in, and if rivals emerge, they must be crushed or, if stubbornly resilient, acquired.Growth becomes the overriding motivation \u2014 something treasured for its own sake, not for anything it brings to the world. Facebook and Google can point to a greater utility that comes from being the central repository of all people, all information, but such market dominance has obvious drawbacks, and not just the lack of competition. As we\u2019ve seen, the extreme concentration of wealth and power is a threat to our democracy by making some people and companies unaccountable.In addition to their power, tech companies have a tool that other powerful industries don\u2019t: the generally benign feelings of the public. To oppose Silicon Valley can appear to be opposing progress, even if progress has been defined as online monopolies; propaganda that distorts elections; driverless cars and trucks that threaten to erase the jobs of millions of people; the Uberization of work life, where each of us must fend for ourselves in a pitiless market.As is becoming obvious, these companies do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. We need greater regulation, even if it impedes the introduction of new services. If we can\u2019t stop their proposals \u2014 if we can\u2019t say that driverless cars may not be a worthy goal, to give just one example \u2014 then are we in control of our society? We need to break up these online monopolies because if a few people make the decisions about how we communicate, shop, learn the news, again, do we control our own society?Out of curiosity, the other day I searched \u201ccellphones\u201d on Google. Before finding even a mildly questioning article about cellphones, I paged down through ads for phones and lists of phones for sale, guides to buying phones and maps with directions to stores that sell phones, some 20 results in total.

It\u2019s all well and good to express your opinion, they were told, but in-your-face street protests are disruptive and can harden opposition.Or, as The Huntsville Times in Alabama put it, \u201cthe path to equal rights\u201d is \u201cdown the road of moderation, mutual respect and minimal resort to mass perturbation.\u201d In another editorial, it said \u201cracial troubles\u201d should be taken \u201coff the streets and into the courts.\u201dThat was 1965, after Sheriff Jim Clark\u2019s uniformed thugs whipped, beat and gassed civil rights marchers in Selma.Two years later, when Martin Luther King announced his opposition to the war in Vietnam, The New York Times editorial page lectured him about getting back to his place as a civil-rights leader. He should, The Times said, \u201cdirect the movement\u2019s efforts in the most constructive and relevant way.\u201dNow comes the National Football League, dropping its pretense of supporting the broad aims of athletes who kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and joining the chorus \u2014 led by President Trump \u2014 that they should find more respectful ways of voicing their anger.In a masterpiece of euphemism, Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, said the league\u2019s leaders \u201ccare deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues.\u201dEveryone \u201cinvolved in the game,\u201d he said, \u201cneeds to come together on a path forward\u201d and added, \u201cIn that spirit let\u2019s resolve that next week, we will meet this challenge in a positive and unified way.\u201dThere\u2019s that pesky \u201cpath\u201d again.

Workplaces are different under the law from public spaces, but there is not a space much more public than a professional football field.And try to imagine for a moment that you walked into work one day and your boss informed you that if you didn\u2019t sing the national anthem, you\u2019d be sent home. Or that you must sign an oath affirming your opposition to, say, the Communist Party. (See: McCarthy era.)All of these arguments are tediously familiar. They were made against the suffragists and later all feminists, and against civil rights demonstrators, Vietnam War protesters, the Black Lives Matter movement, the American Indian Movement, the United Farm Workers. We are sympathetic with the cause, the argument goes, but don\u2019t go overboard.That\u2019s how the subjects of protest talk when they don\u2019t want to confront the protesters.\u201cEveryone here is frustrated by the process, and particularly the politics around this,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for the N.F.L. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a strong feeling at every level that we ought to be getting back to football.\u201dPeople often argue that football games are no place for politics.

And, in fact, singing the national anthem is in itself a political act.But those are \u201cacceptable\u201d political acts that don\u2019t annoy people on Sundays with \u201ccritical social issues.\u201d Or as Jones put it, the mission of the Cowboys is to \u201cto get people\u2019s minds away from the troubled times.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Said to Order Luxembourg to Collect Back Taxes From Amazon", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials will order Luxembourg to collect back taxes from the online retail giant Amazon, a source with knowledge of the decision said Tuesday, the latest in a series of moves where Brussels has sought to flex its regulatory muscle over Silicon Valley.It was not clear how much Luxembourg would be ordered to reclaim, according to the source, who did not want to be identified discussing information that was not yet public. Officials in Luxembourg and the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, declined to comment.The actions have highlighted the heightened scrutiny faced by low-tax nations in the European Union. Those countries, critics argue, help multinationals funnel revenues from larger markets in order to lower their overall tax bill. Such behavior has infuriated larger countries like France, whose budgets have been squeezed in recent years.At the time, the commission said that, in a deal struck in 2003, authorities in Luxembourg had conferred \u201can advantage on Amazon.\u201d The commission added that the \u201cadvantage is obtained every year and ongoing,\u201d and that it \u201cis also granted in a selective manner.\u201dAmazon does business across the 28-nation bloc, but lists its European headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000. The agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg effectively capped the amount of tax Amazon paid, and relied on a method called transfer pricing, according to the commission.Transfer pricing has long been used by multinational companies to assign profits to different units, depending on factors like their role in the overall business and assets. But, according to the commission, these rules are harder to apply for technology companies, because their assets, like intellectual property, are intangible.European regulators have claimed that Amazon sent most of its European revenue from one unit in Luxembourg to a separate subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax in the country. As a result, it was able to reduce the profit it generated from its European operations and cut its tax bill, the commission said.It is not illegal in the European Union for countries to try to lure businesses with low tax rates. But offering special deals to companies that are not available to their competitors can amount to what is known as illegal state aid.Both Amazon and Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry have previously denied that the online retail giant received special tax treatment or benefits.Amazon has already been in the commission\u2019s cross hairs this year for unfair competition.Efforts to curb multinationals from dodging tax have risen in prominence in recent months.Last month, the European Union began considering new proposals broadly aimed at tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.The prominence of Luxembourg has put Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in an awkward position: his role includes oversight of the investigations yet his critics accuse him of having helped turn Luxembourg into a tax haven during his nearly two decades leading that country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Have Idris Elba\u2019s Full Attention", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith... Idris ElbaI don\u2019t know how to break it to Idris Elba.So I just say it. \u201cIs Kate Winslet really the woman you want to be stuck with when disaster strikes in freezing weather? You do know that she didn\u2019t move over to make room on that door and Leo slipped into the icy Atlantic?\u201d\u201cShe was just like, \u2018That guy\u2019s for me,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Elba says.The actor is starring with Ms. Winslet in the \u201cThe Mountain Between Us,\u201d based on a novel about strangers who struggle, snuggle and eat roasted mountain lion in the frigid Utah wilderness after their small plane crashes.Mr. Elba often plays opposite very strong women, and he says that\u2019s fine with him.His Ghana-born \u201cMum\u201d is so into tough love, he says, that at his 45th birthday party recently, she turned her cheek away when he went to kiss her.Mr. Elba also portrays the New York lawyer who defends Molly Bloom, the audacious poker madam to the stars played by a fiery Jessica Chastain in the Aaron Sorkin movie, \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d out Nov. 22. And the actor created one of the most memorable romances in TV history in the popular BBC series \u201cLuther,\u201d when his London homicide detective in the big tweed overcoat, known by his deputies as \u201chis satanic majesty,\u201d gets in an erotic and psychopathic entanglement with a latter-day Lizzie Borden, played with film-noir panache by the flame-haired Ruth Wilson.Mr. Elba confesses that he got jittery during his sex scene with Ms. Winslet because he hasn\u2019t done that many. \u201cI was a bit nervous because it was Kate Winslet, number one,\u201d he says, slyly, and her breasts were exposed. \u201cDo I look, do I not look? Am I supposed to kiss?\u201dIn a world where most movies disappoint and true stars are rare, Mr. Elba is magnetic. He is tall and muscular, and before he hit the big time as the drug lord Stringer Bell in \u201cThe Wire,\u201d he was a bouncer (and pot dealer) at the comedy club Carolines on Broadway, sometimes living in his Chevy Astro van.\u201cReally nice velvety seats,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI miss that little thing. Honestly, if I found one, I\u2019d definitely buy it and ship it back to France to my little house out there.\u201dHe is leaner than he looks on screen, with a small hoop earring, a gray-flecked beard and elaborately tattooed arms. A tree climbs his upper arm. \u201cI have a spiritual connection to trees,\u201d he says. \u201cI kind of use trees as a place to pray.\u201dHis daughter\u2019s name, Isan, is also tattooed on his arm. (She is with him in New York, upstairs in his hotel suite.) And he has a line of a song inked: \u201cThis train carries no wrongdoers,\u201d to indicate that he does not want the people in his life to let him down. He is wearing a snug gray polo shirt and black jeans from his own clothing collection, with a small \u201cIE\u201d emblazoned.When Amy Pascal was head of Sony, she suggested that Mr. Elba might take over the James Bond role if Daniel Craig ever \u201chung up his tuxedo.\u201d As a producer of \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d Ms. Pascal said that they cast Mr. Elba as the lawyer because \u201cif you had to put yourself in someone\u2019s hands, whose hands would you want? He is like the best version of masculinity. All his complicated contradictions make every character he plays fascinating. Maybe it\u2019s the way he walks, like his legs are more powerful than anyone else, like he is gravity. He always seems like he is in the midst of a moral struggle, but he is the calmest one in the room. It\u2019s rare, undeniable movie star stuff.\u201dI remark to him that race seems beside the point in his romantic liaisons on screen.\u201cYeah, my leading ladies have been both black and white and I haven\u2019t thought about it consciously,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, a good friend of mine, a black producer, said to me, \u2018Are you sure about the \u201cMountain\u201d movie, man? Do you think the black audience is going to go for that?\u201d\u2019 (In the book, his character, a surgeon, was white.)He said it had not come up except during a Facebook Live video, when a woman asked if the movie was advocating greater trust between the races during a divisive time in this country.\u201cIf it does, fantastic, but we didn\u2019t think that,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully, you just go and watch a movie about two people falling in love.\u201dNoting that he has starred in several dystopian movies, including the ill-starred \u201cThe Dark Tower,\u201d I wonder if he thinks America is headed toward a racial dystopia under the stewardship of Donald Trump.\u201cI lived in New York before 9/11, and I never felt any real racial tension going on,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018You walk into a bar where everybody knows your name\u2019 type of thing. Then post-9/11, it was a very different tension. You know, you\u2019re fighting an invisible terrorist, so to speak, and now everyone was like, \u2018Who are you and where are you from?\u2019 I could feel the shift and that was part of the reason I moved to L.A., to be honest.\u201dMr. Elba, who played Nelson Mandela in a movie about the South African hero\u2019s life, said he views the racial tension as something \u201cAmerica has to deal with.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s going to change the whole world and make us all be racists,\u201d he says. \u201cI think human beings are smart and freethinking.\u201dGrowing up poor as the son of African immigrants in a part of East London called Canning Town, he says, \u201cit was common to be called a black bastard as you walked down the street. Did it make me a racist against white folks? Not really. The nationalist front had a strong hold in Canning Town, and it was a party that was very vocal about a sort of separatism. I hate to say it, but it was a little bit of a storm in a teacup. Here I am, a product of Canning Town and I\u2019m not that guy that\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s all be separate because I was called a black bastard once.\u201d\u2019\u201cActually,\u201d Mr. Elba says about the uproar, \u201cI personally don\u2019t want to see any more slave films. I think it\u2019s a time that\u2019s been very well documented. \u201812 Years a Slave,\u2019 although a genius movie, I just found it really hard to watch and didn\u2019t want to go back down that road for the sake of entertainment. I think there are a lot more interesting stories that are less covered that we can spend our time on.\u201dI also ask for his response to the kerfuffle when Samuel L. Jackson complained about black British actors getting leads in American movies, such as David Oyelowo playing Martin Luther King Jr. in \u201cSelma\u201d and Daniel Kaluuya in the Jordan Peele horror film, \u201cGet Out.\u201d\u201cThey think they\u2019re better trained, for some reason, than we are because they\u2019re classically trained,\u201d Mr. Jackson told Hot 97, the New York radio station, in March. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the love affair is with all that.\u201d He said he thought that \u201cGet Out,\u201d a movie about white liberal racism, should have featured \u201can American brother who really feels that.\u201dMr. Elba says: \u201cI spoke on this and I spoke quite openly that I was disappointed.\u201d He got a standing ovation when he made a speech to British Parliament last year urging greater diversity in film and television because he could only play so many \u201cbest friends,\u201d \u201cgang leaders\u201d or \u201cathletic types.\u201d (It was around the same time he got snubbed by the Oscars, failing to receive a nomination for his powerful performance as a brutal African warlord with a child army in \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d and wasn\u2019t even invited to the ceremony.)He calls Mr. Jackson \u201ca god\u201d who gets respect \u201cas an actor, black, white, whatever,\u201d but adds: \u201cIt felt like a very stupid thing to say, if I\u2019m really honest and in a time where people are being marginalized, why marginalize us even further by going on about black Americans and English Americans? And to his credit, he read that and apologized. He called and said, \u2018Hey, man. I agree. You\u2019re right, black is black.\u2019 I respect him for actually acknowledging what I said and sort of rethinking it.\u201cAmericans come into England to the theater and play English characters all day long and no one pipes up and says, \u2018Hey, you can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and no one should. It\u2019s called acting for a reason.\u201dI wonder why it\u2019s harder for Americans to get a British accent right than vice versa.\u201cSomething to do with the way the tongue sits in the mouth, believe it or not,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when the English speak, we speak more frontal and it\u2019s harder for Americans to get that sound because the tongue is so much more relaxed. I\u2019ve studied it.\u201dHe did worry about the East Coast accents for \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d however.Just as he was nervous to make love on screen with Ms. Winslet, he says he was nervous to speak the high-velocity words of \u201cthe oracle,\u201d as he calls Mr. Sorkin, especially since it was the writer\u2019s first directing gig.\u201cI thought he\u2019d be super-pedantic and edgy but he was chill,\u201d Mr. Elba says. \u201cSomeone said to him, \u2018We\u2019re going to change lens,\u2019 and he\u2019d say, \u2018Change lens? That\u2019s exactly what I was going to say, let\u2019s change the lens.\u2019 He didn\u2019t pretend to be like a technical genius. He just knows the drama. He really knows words. He knows emotion.\u201dMr. Sorkin also managed not to freak out with him when Mr. Elba engaged in a kickboxing competition in Thailand and England for a documentary days before he arrived, exhausted, in Toronto for shooting.\u201cEveryone was on a knife\u2019s edge, like come on,\u201d Mr. Elba says. \u201c\u2018The truth is, if Idris loses and he gets his face broken or his leg snapped in half, how do we make our movie?\u2019\u201dHe muses: \u201cI think there\u2019s something to be had about testing your fear capacity, something that keeps you alive.\u201d He snaps his fingers. \u201cMaybe it keeps me younger. I think they call that a midlife crisis.\u201dI wonder, given his Parliament speech urging greater diversity in TV and film, including for women, what he made of the recent spat between the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d director, Patty Jenkins, who now holds the record for the biggest United States opening for a film directed by a woman, and James Cameron, who called the movie \u201ca step backward\u201d because Wonder Woman is \u201can objectified icon, and it\u2019s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing.\u201dMr. Cameron got throttled, but he is right that it\u2019s easier for the suits who run Hollywood to accept a gorgeous young woman in a sexy costume than to make movies with middle-aged, non-cartoony heroines struggling with life, the kind Bette Davis and Joan Crawford used to do.\u201cCameron has a point to some degree, but come on!\u201d Mr. Elba says. \u201cLet\u2019s be positive \u2014 it\u2019s a character created for TV in the \u201970s and she kicks ass in the movie. Change is incremental, O.K.? First you can\u2019t have a black guy kissing a white woman. But then you can have a light-skinned black kissing a white woman. And then it changes, you know. So first you can have a lead woman and she is the hero, but she has to be slightly sexualized. It\u2019s going to change.\u201dI ask how he handled the critical drubbing given to \u201cThe Dark Tower,\u201d based on the Stephen King magnum opus, in which he played the Gunslinger. The New York Times\u2019s Manohla Dargis called it \u201can unappealing hash of moviemaking clich\u00e9s\u201d but still praised Mr. Elba\u2019s \u201cirrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t tend to read reviews but this was inescapable,\u201d he says. \u201cCause it made such a big fanfare \u2013 \u2018Dark Tower\u2019 is coming out!\u2019 And the reviews really beat it up. I didn\u2019t take it personally but I was like, ooof, that hurts.\u201dBut the Brit, who comes from a country with much tighter gun-control laws, agonized over taking the part of the interplanetary vigilante, telling Esquire, \u201cI had a clash of conscience with my character. In America, there\u2019s a real awareness of gun culture.\u201d Luther, the London lawman, is about reasoning, not shooting.(Mr. Elba revisited the subject when I reached him after the Las Vegas horror. \u201cYes, I had an internal struggle with the Gunslinger. Given his title, it was impossible to avoid. The human spirit took a meteor-sized hit yesterday, and the world of America is falling off its axis.\u201d)His father once advised him to look people in the eyes. It was the same technique Alfred Hitchcock used when he directed the great actress Eva Marie Saint in her sultry performance opposite Cary Grant in \u201cNorth by Northwest.\u201dIn our A.D.D. planet, it works. Mr. Elba does not look away at his phone, at the waitress when he asks for a knife, at his publicists trying to hustle him along or at his steak salad and steak and eggs. His expressive brown eyes are always on you.His vibe is cool but his career is frenetic. When he\u2019s not starring in movies and \u201cLuther,\u201d he\u2019s directing movies, designing clothes, D.J.-ing in London and Ibiza, and producing his own music, as well as making documentaries about his adventures kickboxing in Thailand and car racing in Ireland. Maybe that\u2019s why his personal life is so turbulent; he has vowed never to marry again.He has had two children \u2014 a 15-year-old girl and a 3-year-old son \u2014 with two makeup artists, one of whom he married, and a brief second marriage to a lawyer. He publicly stepped out with his new girlfriend, Sabrina Dhowre, a former Miss Vancouver, at last month\u2019s debut of \u201cMolly\u2019s Game\u201d at the Toronto International Film Festival. He met her when he went to Vancouver and British Columbia (standing in for Utah) to make \u201cThe Mountain Between Us.\u201d\u201cFalling in love while falling in love,\u201d he says, dreamily.He also experienced that \u201cYou are not the father\u201d moment that can either be the worst or best moment of a man\u2019s life. In a therapeutic moment four years ago, he told a GQ reporter the \u201ctragic, punch-in-the-face\u201d story of how he discovered that the son he thought he had had with a woman he was involved with in Florida was not his.\u201cIt is definitely without a doubt one of the worst things to happen to any person, and I include her,\u201d he tells me about his ex. \u201cBecause whatever she went through and did, she was hoping that I would never find out, and I did. So for all three of us including the boy, it was. \u2026\u201d His voice gets softer with each word until he finally trails off.How did he find out? I ask.\u201cMy mom came and saw us and she said, \u2018That\u2019s not your son,\u201d\u2019 he says, adding: \u201cSo I just did a paternity test.\u201dHe shakes his head ruefully and says that was absolutely not true and that many stories about his relationships are \u201ccompletely wrong,\u201d but that he doesn\u2019t like to fight back in public.\u201cI think I\u2019m the most misunderstood partner ever,\u201d he says, looking distraught. \u201cI\u2019ve had many failed relationships but not because I\u2019m an ass, just because there\u2019s so many complexities to relationships and perhaps I\u2019m very guarded, just like Luther\u2019s guarded. And being guarded, people presume things and I often haven\u2019t corrected them.\u201cThey just have so much of who I am wrong, they feel like I must be a playboy. I must be noncommittal. I must be the kind of guy that jumps in and out. And, you know, I suppose if you look at my history or you know anything about my history or you can read on Google who I was married to or what\u2019s happened, you know, it might appear that way. But it\u2019s completely misunderstood. People think they know about me and my past and my relationships and they don\u2019t. There\u2019s very few people that can say they really, really know me and I can say, \u2018Yes, you really, really know me.\u2019 Very few people. Very few.\u201dI ask him about a rap lyric he wrote that fame brings you to the \u201cdevil\u2019s door.\u201d\u201cI live a duality, do you know what I mean?\u201d he says. \u201cI got an O.B.E. It\u2019s Officer of the British Empire, but I\u2019ve always known it as a British sweetheart, treasured.\u201cBut I\u2019m a naughty boy. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? I sort of live a full life, and naughty. And I\u2019m one knock away from the devil\u2019s door. Because, you know, I\u2019m human, man. But at the same time, I\u2019m honored by my country and I\u2019m like, yeah,\u201d as long as he doesn\u2019t mess up or be a jerk, he says, using raunchier words. \u201cThere\u2019s responsibility to be a leader on the right moral side. Don\u2019t go out there and get coked off your face and get caught in orgies. Not that I would.\u201dI reassure him that Mick Jagger has been knighted, so other naughty boys are in the Queen\u2019s pack of aces. And I wonder if there\u2019s any other challenge on the horizon, noting that he would make a remarkable Othello.\u201cDon\u2019t like the story,\u201d he says brusquely.But why?\u201cJealousy\u2019s a real poison and I\u2019m not into it,\u201d he says.Is that because you get jealous?\u201cIt\u2019s a poison,\u201d he repeats, laughing. As we get ready to leave, I pose the question I know Mr. Elba doesn\u2019t like: \u201cI have to ask about James Bond because George Clooney has now said you would be a \u2018perfect James Bond and it would be a great step forward.\u201d\u2019\u201cGeorge Clooney said that?\u201d Mr. Elba asks with a skeptical grin.\u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the James Bond thing continues to go. I think it\u2019s more about, we just want to have a black guy play James Bond rather than Idris Elba the actor play James Bond. That\u2019s the part that I\u2019m like, \u2018Ugh, come on.\u2019\u201dSo at long last, we need to know: Does he like martinis? Offering his most suave look, Mr. Elba murmurs: \u201cI like them stirred. Not shaken. Jesus Christ, did I just say that out loud?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Matt Orlando Brings California Sun to Copenhagen", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 It was late May here, after 9 p.m., and the sun was hardly ready to set. So Matt Orlando, taking a break from service at Amass, where he is the chef and owner, preferred to sit outside in the garden, amid herbs and vegetables that were struggling to mature.\u201cWe can grow mainly green stuff, and it fluctuates day by day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a short season, over by mid-September.\u201d The restaurant is set in a scrubby warehouse district at the edge of the city and has an acre or so of land.His tasting menu that evening included spring garlic, knotweed, herbs foraged at the beach, lovage, rhubarb and a leafy northern plant called orpin with a slightly bitter flavor. A plate strewn with green asparagus and herbs dressed with kelp oil and meant to be eaten without utensils was powdered with dried green strawberry dust, a testament to how impatient a chef can become with the season, finding use for underripe berries. Seaweed was another significant ingredient.By now, Mr. Orlando, 40, who is from sunny Encinitas, Calif., near San Diego, is thoroughly invested in the Nordic sensibility. He had been sous-chef at the world-famous Noma in Copenhagen and eventually became the head chef before leaving about five years ago to open Amass, where he has built on his experience at Noma. His Danish wife, Julie Bergstrom Orlando, whom he met at Noma, runs Amass.He said his flavors are bolder than at Noma, less in the \u201clight green, acidic\u201d style of Nordic fare, as he put it, reflecting his American background and his experience at restaurants like Le Bernardin, Aureole and Per Se in New York, and the Fat Duck and Le Manoir aux Quat\u2019Saisons in England. Some of his dishes, like beet sherbet puckered with rhubarb, salted grains and juniper, still convey the sour, fermented flavors typical of the region.Others are rich. \u201cI like to put a little fat in the food,\u201d he said. A sheen of smoked lamb fat dresses slow-roasted lamb culotte steak. His irresistible warm potato flatbread, which comes nestled in a square of homespun linen, is drenched in golden butter. Not only was this bread memorable for its comfort-food deliciousness, it was also a rare example that did not rely on the dark allure of rustic whole grains. \u201cWhite flour just works better for this,\u201d he said. It keeps the breads light. Their subtle flakiness comes from folding the dough over itself, as in croissant-making.His restaurant, which combines such inventiveness with satisfaction in a laid-back setting, has become a magnet for diners in the know. \u201cI am a regular; it is probably my favorite restaurant in Copenhagen,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, the chef and an owner of Noma, in an email. \u201cI think Amass is Copenhagen at its best right now.\u201dMr. Orlando said that Mr. Redzepi told him that by adding tablecloths, he could get a Michelin star or two. As of now, he has neither tablecloths nor stars, though Amass is listed in the guidebook. Mr. Orlando said he\u2019s stopped thinking about it.As with his food, Mr. Orlando\u2019s content to go his own way. \u201cThe more conservative European dining establishment has not yet accepted rap beats, graffiti indoors, the concrete walls,\u201d Mr. Redzepi said. The dominant color scheme at Amass is industrial, dour concrete gray with iron accents.The restaurant has a fermentation room, where leftover wine becomes vinegar, and food trimmings participate in homemade soy sauce. The potato bread is made with a starter of fermented potatoes, though home cooks can skip that part. His recipe also recommends saving the potato skins, which find a purpose in the restaurant, though he realizes that a home cook might not use them.Mr. Orlando is aggressive about sustainability.

{"Headline": "Dog Doping at the Iditarod: Dallas Seavey, a Legend in the Sport, Is Named", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a major blow to the integrity of the Iditarod dog-sled race, officials for the sport on Monday identified the four-time champion Dallas Seavey as the musher whose dogs recently tested positive for banned drugs in this year\u2019s competition.Earlier this month, the Iditarod Trail Committee made the surprising announcement that four of the dogs in this year\u2019s event had tested positive for the opioid pain reliever Tramadol. It was the first time dogs had tested positive for a prohibited substance since the race began testing in 1994.\u201cThe Iditarod can try to run me over, they can try to throw me under the bus,\u201d Seavey said in the video, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to be honest to myself and they\u2019re going to find out that I don\u2019t fit under the bus.\u201dAs a result of the violation, race officials said, they reworked the rules to establish clearer standards for what constitutes a violation and for how a musher\u2019s culpability can be proved or disproved. The revision to the regulation, known as Rule 39, stipulates penalties for violations, including disqualification or even a ban from future competition.According to the committee\u2019s statement that identified Seavey, he denied that he had administered the drug and said that doing so would have been irrational since he was aware of the testing. He said that Tramadol, in his opinion, would not give him a competitive advantage, according to the statement.But in his video, Seavey went further, calling the proceedings \u201ca cancer\u201d on the sport and saying he believes the positive test was the result of a malicious attack from either another musher or from one of the protest groups that wants to harm the Iditarod. He said he was told in April about the positive result and had tried to work with the board to make the information public in order to exonerate himself but that the board would not work with him. He also said he expected ramifications for speaking up.\u201cI fully expect that after this I will be banned from the Iditarod based on the gag rule,\u201d he said, making reference to a rule he claimed prevents mushers from discussing internal matters.The committee initially kept Seavey\u2019s identity secret, but after an emergency session on Monday they reversed course and named him because of a \u201clevel of unhealthy speculation involved in this matter.\u201dThe pressure had come largely from the Iditarod Official Finishers Club, which issued a statement signed by 83 current and former competitors demanding the identity of the musher in question be revealed.\u201cIt is unacceptable that multiple dogs tested positive for a drug in a single musher\u2019s team and that that information was only recently made public when it was known since shortly after the team finished,\u201d the statement said.That it was a member of the Seavey family adds a great deal of weight to the issue, considering their importance to the race\u2019s history. Dallas Seavey, 30, was the youngest musher to win the Iditarod when he captured the 2012 title, and he also won in 2014, 2015 and 2016. His father has three titles, as well as the world record time. His wife, Jen, ran the race in 2009, and his grandfather, Dan, competed in the first two Iditarod races in 1973 and 1974.After his fourth Iditarod win, Dallas Seavey explained what the accomplishment meant to his family, saying \u201cIt\u2019s just another day of mushing, man. This is what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Next Arab Spring? Women\u2019s Rights", "Date": "2017-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORAN, Algeria \u2014 Who is still waging revolution in the Arab world? Not the Islamists, who have trapped themselves in violence or extremism. Not the left-wing elites, now aging, disarmed and discredited after the debacle of their nationalist movements. Not the young bloggers who were at the forefront of various uprisings of the Arab Spring: They are held back, sometimes frozen, by intimidation or censorship (throughout the region), police surveillance (in Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia), prison (in Egypt) or death (in Syria).The only person who seems exempt from this harsh assessment is an elderly North African, a lawyer by training and a former militant in the anticolonialist movement: B\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd Essebsi, the president of Tunisia. The good Arab revolutionary of the moment is a 90-year-old head of state.If this statement sounds surprising, it\u2019s because people in the West have yet to take the true measure of this man\u2019s political finesse, including his ability to slowly consolidate a difficult consensus between democrats and Islamists. Tunisia admittedly is experiencing some problems, especially economic ones, as well as an intense controversy about a law \u2014 supported by Mr. Essebsi \u2014 that grants amnesty to former officials accused of corruption. But the president of Tunisia has also become the leading figure of reformism in the Arab world by advocating equal inheritance rights for Muslim women and their right to marry non-Muslim foreigners.According to Islamic jurisprudence, barring exceptional circumstances, women heirs have a right to only half the inheritance of men. In Tunisia, and elsewhere in the Arab world, statelegal systems have not dared take on this taboo. Add to these rules a patriarchal structure that systematically dispossesses widows in favor of their brothers-in-law and parents-in-law. Together these practices undermine the independence of women, often reducing them to being dependents for life.The constitutions of Tunisia, Algeria and other countries in the region may exalt freedom of conscience and of religious choice, but in Algeria, to take one example, a woman\u2019s decision to marry a non-Muslim is still subject to ferociously dissuasive constraints. Her foreign husband must convert to Islam, in front of witnesses, and produce a certificate. Yet in the opposite case \u2014 when a Muslim Tunisian man wishes to marry a non-Muslim woman \u2014 nothing is required of the lucky lady.These two sets of limitations have been in place in one form or another for centuries and constitute part of the ideological basis of Muslim society, which remains very rural overall. Virtually no political leader has dared challenge them for fear of losing popular support. (The reform project of Habib Bourguiba, the father of modern Tunisia and its first president, ran aground over fierce opposition from conservatives and zealots.)Yet in August Mr. Essebsi delivered a speech before the Tunisian government that caused a storm. Even as he stated that he didn\u2019t want to shock the Tunisian people, which is predominantly Muslim, he pointed out that under the Constitution, the Tunisian state was \u201ccivil,\u201d and turning to the rights of men and women, added: \u201cWe must state that we are moving toward equality between them in every sphere. And the whole issue hinges on the matter of inheritance.\u201dIn mid-September, another bombshell: At Mr. Essebsi\u2019s urging, the government rescinded a 1973 administrative order forbidding Muslim women from marrying non-Muslims. Monia Ben J\u00e9mia, the president of l\u2019Association tunisienne des femmes d\u00e9mocrates (The Tunisian Association of Women Democrats), underlined the measure\u2019s significance for the entire Arab world. \u201cTunisia is becoming a kind of endogenous model of progress,\u201d she said. \u201cThis calls out our neighbors in the Maghreb; it\u2019s a very positive thing.\u201dIslamists of all stripes, well aware of the tremendous implications of Mr. Essebsi\u2019s initiatives, were quick to react. An Egyptian preacher living in Turkey called the old Tunisian, \u201ca criminal, miscreant, apostate and secularist.\u201d In Cairo, the deputy of the Grand Imam of Al Azhar, the leading Sunni religious authority, declared on his Facebook page that equal inheritance rights \u201cwere harmful to women, unjust to them and contrary to Shariah law.\u201d In Algeria, where I live, Islamist newspapers attacked Mr. Essebsi indirectly, echoing critical voices from elsewhere.For its part, Tunisia\u2019s main Islamist party, Ennahda, adopted an official position of reserve and silence \u2014 perhaps reasoning that open resistance would cast it in a bad light even as the country prepares for local elections in a few months. One could call the posture political, or politicking, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less extraordinary: in fact, the reverse, because it privileges politics over ideology.Mr. Essebsi\u2019s declarations also have the virtue of highlighting what remains to be done in the Muslim world to complete the Arab Spring. It wasn\u2019t enough to bring down dictatorships; now the patriarchy must be toppled. In addition to revising constitutions or imposing term limits for leaders, fundamental rights must be secured, and in practice, particularly those that ensure gender equality.For the time being, laws throughout the Arab world tend to ratify inequality, especially when it comes to inheritance. In Algeria, despite the struggles of democrats and feminist groups since the country\u2019s independence in 1962, the family code still largely tracks Shariah law: A woman\u2019s choice of husband must be validated by a male guardian. So-called honor crimes \u2014 as punishment for adultery, among other things \u2014 remain widespread, even in countries deemed to be moderate, like Jordan.The old Tunisian revolutionary has thus exposed one of the mechanisms that continues to handicap the Arab world: collusion between civil laws and religious laws. The latter overlap with the former and modify them, transforming their spirit, covertly or overtly. At the same time, Mr. Essebsi\u2019s positions also suggest some means of resistance and possibilities for deep reform.Is this the eve of another Arab Spring? Perhaps. Morocco, Jordan and Lebanon have finally abolished laws that allowed a woman\u2019s rapist to escape prosecution by marrying her. Last week, the king of Saudi Arabia authorized Saudi women to drive cars.But Saudi women, for example, are still not free to travel or dress as they please. And so it is Mr. Essebsi who has opened an enormous crack in the foundation of Muslim conservatism and set a unique precedent by validating various feminist and intellectual movements.His stand has yet to be fully appreciated: It is revolutionary \u2014 Copernican, even. The president of Tunisia has proclaimed the equality of women in the Arab world, a social universe in which the Earth is still flat.Kamel Daoud is the author of the novel \u201cThe Meursault Investigation.\u201d This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tech Is Starting to Make Me Uneasy", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s gadget season in the tech world. Think of it like New York Fashion Week, untucked white-man edition.But despite the baubles and billion-dollar office parks, I\u2019m really not feeling it this year. The technology industry is still exciting; it still packs the capacity for surprise. But where the surprise once felt like Christmas morning, it\u2019s now like the entering-the-darkened-basement scene of a horror movie.Technology has crossed over to the dark side. It\u2019s coming for you; it\u2019s coming for us all, and we may not survive its advance.I\u2019ve been covering tech for nearly 20 years; for the past three, since I inherited the State of the Art column from David Pogue, I\u2019ve explored for The New York Times how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future.Not only am I lucky enough to have my dream job, but it\u2019s perfectly timed, too. In the years that I\u2019ve written the column, the technology business has swallowed the world, becoming by far the largest and most consequential industry on the globe. Silicon Valley today is like Wall Street in the 1980s, or the defense industry in the 1950s: enjoying gargantuan growth and shaping much of the rest of the rest of the economy, not to mention art, culture, politics, education and healthcare.So why am I feeling so bad about tech?Well, who isn\u2019t, right? Look around you. It\u2019s difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when smartphones and social networks might be ruining the world. The technologies we were most excited about 10 years ago are now implicated in just about every catastrophe of the day. (See how Russian propagandists used Facebook and Twitter to inject false narratives into the news media last year.)These companies are not evil; they\u2019re all led and staffed by smart, well-meaning people who believe that technology can radically improve the world. But as I argue in the series, we have not, as a society, come to grips with the scope of their control over our lives. And we don\u2019t have many good ways to limit it, if we decided that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do.A lot of these worries aren\u2019t new. Though Silicon Valley runs on heedless optimism, much of The Times\u2019s coverage has long been properly skeptical and critical of the implications of new tech. Consider the evil of \u201crevenge porn,\u201d or the rise in accidents caused by drivers looking at their phones. I\u2019ve shared other fears: In 2008, I wrote a book predicting that the internet would lead us into a \u201cpost-fact\u201d world.Still, until this year, the problems caused by tech felt manageable \u2014 bumps on the road to a better tomorrow that we\u2019d eventually figure out. I managed to retain the capacity to be viscerally excited by tech, to instantly fall for its potential and possibilities. And I bought into it personally. You should see my house: I\u2019ve outfitted it with every kind of doodad you can imagine, including cameras that record everything we do, lights that switch on by voice, a toilet you have to plug in and, once, an electronic trashcan. (Manual is better, trust me.) There\u2019s a lot about it I now can\u2019t live without; every time I want to snap a picture of my kids, which is maybe five times an hour, I\u2019m grateful for the smartphone.And yet now it all comes freighted with worry. That\u2019s what\u2019s different. In 2007, when Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone, just about everyone greeted the new device as an unalloyed good. I was one of them. Here was a genuinely new thing that would Make Your Life Better, we all thought: It would be convenient, it would be fun, it wasn\u2019t serious or dangerous or globe-shattering. That\u2019s no longer true.The State of the Art, today, is a bag of mixed emotions. Tech might improve everything. And it\u2019s probably also terrible in ways we\u2019re only just starting to understand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Austria Shifts Right as Refashioned Conservatives Win", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 Austria\u2019s 31-year-old foreign minister led the conservative party to a major political victory on Sunday, with the People\u2019s Party emerging as the strongest political force in the country, setting the course for a shift to the right.Supporters of the foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, erupted into cheers as preliminary results showed his party surging ahead of its traditional rival, the center-left Social Democratic Party, for only the second time since 1970.\u201cWe made the impossible possible,\u201d Mr. Kurz told supporters who had gathered in the 19th-century Kursalon music hall in Vienna to watch the results after five months of intense campaigning.\u201cI promise you that I will fight with everything that I have for change in this land,\u201d Mr. Kurz said. \u201cWe have to establish a new political style in this country, we have to create a new culture.\u201dPreliminary results released by the Interior Ministry showed the People\u2019s Party winning 31.4 percent of the vote, and President Alexander Van der Bellen declared the young minister the \u201cclear winner\u201d of the evening. The president is expected to tap Mr. Kurz to form a government once the results are finalized later this week, after absentee ballots are counted.Mr. Kurz, in television interviews on Sunday, repeatedly declined to name a potential partner for his government, saying that he would wait to open talks with other parties until a final result is in, which is expected by Friday.The conservatives have served as the junior partner in governments led by the center-left Socialist Party since 2007. But it was seen as unlikely that the two parties would continue a coalition after this election, in part because of a campaign scandal in which the Socialists were linked to two fake Facebook pages smearing Mr. Kurz.The Socialists, led by Chancellor Christian Kern, 51, finished third with 26.7 percent of the vote, preliminary results showed.The most likely coalition partner appeared to be the nationalist, populist Freedom Party, which initial results showed winning 27.1 percent of the vote. The party complained during the election campaign that Mr. Kurz had stolen its playbook, seizing on issues like limits to immigration and the threat posed to Austrian identity by Islam.Despite participating in neo-Nazi activities as a youth, Mr. Strache has tried to cast his party in a more centrist light \u2014 unlike previous leaders who were known for remarks sympathetic to the Nazis \u2014 while remaining sharply critical of Islam. He has insisted that the party would not call into question Austria\u2019s European Union membership if it entered the government.\u201cWe say yes to Europe, but we are critical,\u201d Mr. Strache said on Sunday.Sunday\u2019s outcome appears set to shift Austria\u2019s political course, a move that is sure to please right-wing leaders in Poland and neighboring Hungary, but could strain ties with France and Austria\u2019s neighbor to the north, Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel called Mr. Kurz, whose conservative party is in a bloc with her own in the European Parliament, to offer her congratulations.The World Jewish Congress called the Austrian election results \u201cdistressing.\u201d It called on Mr. Kurz not to enter into government with the Freedom Party, warning in a statement that the party \u201cis still full of xenophobes and racists and is, mildly put, very ambiguous toward Austria\u2019s Nazi past.\u201d\u201cIf I am asked, I will carry out talks and try make possible the changes that Austria really needs, first the tax cuts for working people, making our social welfare system more secure and fighting illegal immigration that endangers the order and security in our country,\u201d Mr. Kurz said in an interview. He insisted that despite its focus on limiting immigration, his party remained a centrist force.A demonstration of about 200 people carrying signs reading \u201cNazis Out\u201d marched through the streets of Vienna after the first projections showed the conservative party emerging on top.\u201cGrab a drink, because we have something to celebrate tonight,\u201d said Ursula Zoehrer, 47, a civil servant from the western state of Tyrol, who was celebrating Mr. Kurz\u2019s victory in Vienna. Like many who cast their votes for the People\u2019s Party, Ms. Zoehrer credited the minister\u2019s energy and promise of change for her decision to support him.\u201cAustrian politics was quite stuck, and those in charge didn\u2019t listen to the people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf something was wrong, they blamed the E.U. But I think Mr. Kurz is really enthusiastic and he will try to break up the system.\u201dSeveral smaller parties also made it into Parliament, although the Greens appeared to have fallen short of the 4 percent support needed to win seats.At the Freedom Party\u2019s celebration, Josef Tscherwenka of Vienna said migration remained his largest worry.\u201cThe pictures of refugees coming in from 2015 are still frightening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s frightening we don\u2019t know who is in the country. Austria just can\u2019t afford this migration.\u201dKimberly Bradley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Warner: Tech Millionaire Who Became Tech\u2019s Critic in Congress", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "The Democratic senator from Virginia is emblematic of the shifting politics for big technology companies, which face congressional hearings this week.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mark Warner was fired up. Sitting in his basement office at the Capitol last week, he leaned forward in his chair, waved his hands in the air and pounded his fingers on the coffee table.He was talking about how some of the biggest American technology companies, like Facebook, Google and Twitter, were used to spread foreign propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. And he wanted to make clear that those businesses had made major mistakes before and after the election.Not only were Russian-linked accounts able to take advantage of the services, Mr. Warner said. The tech companies also took months to hand over information about those accounts. And he is still not convinced, he said, that the businesses are revealing everything they know about how their products were manipulated.\u201cThey\u2019ve grown so quickly,\u201d said Mr. Warner, 62, a Democrat from Virginia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019ve fully realized the implications of all their power.\u201dThis week, Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will push for new answers. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify at congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday about the election and the power of their platforms.Lawmakers are increasingly taking a critical tone with Silicon Valley, with Mr. Warner among the harshest. He has already pushed a bill requiring the companies to disclose who paid for digital political ads, the biggest legislative effort so far to regulate the companies.Mr. Warner\u2019s position is a sharp reversal. Before entering politics, he built a fortune that at one time was estimated at around $200 million as a technology and telecommunications investor and executive. His political identity, first as governor of Virginia and then as a senator, has been wrapped in promises to bring 21st century jobs. He has a broad and close network of tech executives and investors.Mr. Warner is emblematic of the shifting politics for technology.\u201cThat is a poor attitude for American companies,\u201d Mr. Chambliss added. \u201cMark will make sure this issue is highlighted because it needs to stop.\u201d\u201cTwitter is taking an appropriate and welcome step,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said last week.The companies say the internal investigations and answering lawmakers\u2019 questions are a top priority. In their announcements on voluntary ad disclosures, Twitter and Facebook said their stricter policies for who can place political ads and promises to make those purchases public are signs of their commitment to correcting their mistakes.\u201cWe look forward to answering lawmakers\u2019 questions,\u201d said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy for Facebook, in a statement. \u201cWe take this issue very seriously and think it\u2019s important Congress gets the full picture of what happened, including what we know about Russian activity on our platform, and is able to share its assessment with the American public.\u201dBut lawmakers said the companies, who have been interacting privately for months, still have a long way to go.Last week, congressional aides said the online giants were pushing back against lawmakers. The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday. Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news. In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues. And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.\u201cIf their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies. The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses. Some are also afraid of crossing other party members or President Trump, who regularly play down Russian interference in the election.Republicans have slowly begun calling for more scrutiny of the companies. But lawmakers who are more oriented toward free markets have been reluctant to regulate the rapidly evolving industry. Other top regulators, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, are also considered unlikely to take strong action against the industry.That has made it easier for Mr. Warner to assert himself as a leading voice about the power of the tech companies \u2014 as unexpected as it may be.Mr. Warner accumulated his wealth with an early investment in the cellular service provider Nextel, which was sold to Sprint in 2005 for $35 billion. Mr. Warner then became a start-up investor at Columbia Capital, which had an office in Alexandria, Va. He used his fortune to run for governor of Virginia, talking on the campaign trail about bringing work force training and tech-oriented economic development to rural parts of the state. After serving a term, he was elected to the Senate in 2008.And even with his recent criticism of the industry, he regularly taps a broad network of tech executives and investors for counsel.During the summer, Steve Case, the founder of AOL, stayed at Mr. Warner\u2019s vacation home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. For years, the two have met regularly to talk about techology-related policy issues, like how artificial intelligence could alter the future of labor.But during this year\u2019s trip, they discussed the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s Russia investigation and the power of social media platforms and their role in the election.\u201cHis thinking has evolved,\u201d Mr. Case said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m sure this has some benefit with his profile, all things being equal, I think he has approached this with some reluctance because he\u2019d rather be focused on issues like the future of work.\u201dAnd Mr. Warner sees no contradiction in his evolution to being considered a sharp prod of Silicon Valley.\u201cLook, I\u2019m pro-tech. I\u2019m pro-innovation,\u201d he said, standing and shuffling side to side like a basketball player on defense. On the bookshelf near him was a textbook, \u201cScience and Engineering,\u201d and a small business self-help book called \u201cGrow Regardless: Of Your Business\u2019s Size, Your Industry or the Economy ... and Despite the Government!\u201dHe went on: \u201cWhat I fear is 2018. If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I.,\u201d he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.\u201cThere is too much at stake,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "10 Ways to Teach Argument-Writing With The New York Times", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdated, Feb. 20, 2019 with new resources. How can writing change people\u2019s understanding of the world? How can it influence public opinion? How can it lead to meaningful action?_________1. Explore the role of a newspaper opinion section.How would your students describe the differences between the news sections of a newspaper and the opinion section? What do they have in common? How do they differ? Where else in newspapers are opinions \u2014 for instance, in the form of reviews or personal essays \u2014 often published?Bring in a few print copies of a newspaper, whether The Times or a local or school paper, and have your students work in small groups to contrast a news page with an opinion page and see what they discover.Here at the Op-Ed page, there are certain questions that are as constant as the seasons. How does one get published? Who chooses the articles? Does The Times have an agenda? And, of course, why was my submission rejected? Now that I\u2019ve been Op-Ed editor for a year, let me try to offer a few answers.Anything can be an Op-Ed. We\u2019re not only interested in policy, politics or government. We\u2019re interested in everything, if it\u2019s opinionated and we believe our readers will find it worth reading. We are especially interested in finding points of view that are different from those expressed in Times editorials. If you read the editorials, you know that they present a pretty consistent liberal point of view. There are lots of other ways of looking at the world, to the left and right of that position, and we are particularly interested in presenting those points of view.\u2022 What pieces look most interesting to you? Why?\u2022 What subsections are featured in the links across the top of the section (\u201cColumnists\u201d; \u201cSeries\u201d; \u201cEditorials\u201d; \u201cOp-Ed\u201d; \u201cLetters\u201d; etc.) and what do you find in each? How do they seem to work together?\u2022 How do you think the editors of this section decide what to publish?\u2022 What role does this section seem to play in The Times as a whole?\u2022 Would you ever want to write an Op-Ed or a letter to the editor? What might you write about?__________2. Know the difference between fact and opinion.For instance, you might invite them to read an Op-Ed and underline the facts and circle the opinion statements they find, then compare their work in small groups.Or, read a news report and an opinion piece on the same topic and look for the differences. For example, which of the first paragraphs below about the shooting in Las Vegas is from a news article and which is from an opinion piece? How can they tell?__________In 350 B.C., Aristotle was already wondering what could make content \u2014 in his case, a speech \u2014 persuasive and memorable, so that its ideas would pass from person to person. The answer, he argued, was three principles: ethos, pathos, and logos. Content should have an ethical appeal, an emotional appeal, or a logical appeal. A rhetorician strong on all three was likely to leave behind a persuaded audience. Replace rhetorician with online content creator, and Aristotle\u2019s insights seem entirely modern. Ethics, emotion, logic \u2014 it\u2019s credible and worthy, it appeals to me, it makes sense. If you look at the last few links you shared on your Facebook page or Twitter stream, or the last article you e-mailed or recommended to a friend, chances are good that they\u2019ll fit into those categories.__________4. Identify claims and evidence.The Common Core Standards put argument front and center in American education, and even young readers are now expected to be able to identify claims in opinion pieces and find the evidence to support them.We have a number of lesson plans that can help.__________5. Adopt a columnist.We have heard from many teachers over the years that a favorite assignment is to have students each \u201cadopt\u201d a different newspaper columnist, and follow him or her over weeks or months, noting the issues they focus on and the rhetorical strategies they use to make their cases. Throughout, students can compare what they find \u2014 and, of course, apply what they learn to their own writing.Michelle AlexanderCharles M. BlowJamelle BouieDavid BrooksFrank BruniRoger CohenGail CollinsRoss DouthatMaureen DowdThomas L. FriedmanMichelle GoldbergNicholas KristofPaul KrugmanDavid LeonhardtFarhad ManjooJennifer SeniorBret Stephens__________6. Explore visual argument-making via Times Op-Art, editorial cartoons and Op-Docs.The New York Times regularly commissions artists and cartoonists to create work to accompany Opinion pieces. How do illustrations like the one above add meaning to a text, while grabbing readers\u2019 attention at the same time? What can students infer about the argument being made in an Op-Ed article by looking at the illustration alone?Does Technology Make Us More Alone?Is It Ethical to Eat Meat?Is It O.K. for Men and Boys to Comment on Women and Girls on the Street?Are Some Youth Sports Too Intense?Does Reality TV Promote Dangerous Stereotypes?When Do You Become an Adult?Is America Headed in the Right Direction?Teachers tell us they use our writing prompts because they offer an opportunity for students to write for an \u201cauthentic audience.\u201d But we also consider our daily questions to be a chance for the kind of \u201clow-stakes\u201d writing that can help students practice thinking through thorny questions informally._________What issues matter most to your students?The challenge is pretty straightforward. Choose a topic you care about, gather evidence from sources both within and outside of The New York Times, and write a concise editorial (450 words or less) to convince readers of your point of view.To help guide this contest, we have published two new ideas from teachers:_________9. Take advice from writers and editors at the Times\u2019s Opinion section.How can you write a powerful Op-Ed or editorial?Well, over the years, many Times editors and writers have given the aspiring opiners advice. In the video above, for instance, Andrew Rosenthal, in his previous role as Editorial Page editor, detailed seven pointers for the students who participate in our annual Editorial Contest,_________10.

{"Headline": "Mass Killings of Long Ago: 3 Early Eruptions of \u2018Suppressed Rage\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis moment of distressing recognition isn\u2019t new, even if mass killings have grown more common and the weapons more powerful. At various times in the first half of the 20th century, Americans picked up the newspaper to see that a man had committed an act of unthinkable violence.Here\u2019s a look at three mass killings by lone assailants from before 1950, carried out with bullets and bombs.Nine people were killed after Gilbert Twigg opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun at a concert in Winfield, Kan., in August 1903. He killed himself at the scene.It appears that Twigg was disappointed several years ago in a love affair, and that he had brooded over it to such an extent that he was convinced the citizens of Winfield were making light of his troubles.He wrote that he had harmed no man and had never violated the laws of his country and that the deed he was about to perpetrate was for the purpose of \u2018getting even\u2019 with those who had shunned him and interested themselves unnecessarily in his affairs.After \u201cthe maniacal deed,\u201d The Times reported, \u201cquite a large sum of money was found upon Twigg\u2019s person.\u201dAndrew Kehoe, a school board treasurer in Bath Township, Mich., planted explosives under the local school months in advance before killing his wife, bombing his farm and setting off explosions at the school that killed 38 children, five adults and himself.It continued: \u201cRecounting the man\u2019s characteristics tonight, neighbors recalled that he had appeared intelligent, but with a tendency toward being pugnacious.\u201dAfter the bombing, \u201ca moan from a mother or a stifled cry here and there from a father as a blanket was lifted testified that another search was ended,\u201d the article said. \u201cMany of the mothers and fathers clasped in their arms the bodies of their children and carried them to their homes, refusing the services of ambulances and hearses that came from surrounding towns.\u201dAt Kehoe\u2019s farm, the police found a sign that offered insight into the killer\u2019s psychology. It read, \u201cCriminals are made, not born.\u201dOn a fall morning in 1949, Howard Unruh, who would later be found criminally insane, went for a walk through his Camden, N.J., neighborhood with a Luger pistol.The police also used tear gas, and eventually he came outside with his hands up.Unruh was later found to have paranoid schizophrenia, and a psychiatric report found that he had believed his neighbors were belittling him and \u201cthinking of him as a homosexual.\u201dThe report described him as \u201ca master of suppressed rage\u201d who harbored a \u201csmoldering anger.\u201dBut he had been calm when, as the police lay siege to his apartment, he answered a phone call from Philip W. Buxton, an editor for The Camden Courier-Post.Buxton asked Unruh how many people he had killed.\u201cI don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t counted,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks like a pretty good score.\u201d\u201cWhy are you killing people?\u201d Buxton asked.Unruh replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fox News Apologizes for Featuring Veteran Who Lied About Being a Navy SEAL", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarlier this month, Fox News featured a story about a highly decorated veteran: a Navy SEAL who had served in Vietnam, had earned two Purple Hearts and had hand-carved a presidential seal that he hoped to give to President Trump.But on Thursday, the network issued a correction to the Oct. 8 segment about the veteran, John Garofalo, and said that \u201call\u201d of his claims \u201cturned out to be untrue.\u201d\u201cThe fact is that he did not serve in Vietnam,\u201d Fox said in its statement.\u201cHe was never a U.S. Navy SEAL,\u201d it continued. \u201cEven though he showed us medals, Garofalo was not awarded two Purple Hearts or any of the other nearly two dozen commendations he claimed to have received, except for the National Defense Service Medal.\u201dThe statement concluded, \u201cWe apologize to our viewers, especially veterans and servicemen and women.\u201d\u201cIt got bigger and bigger,\u201d Mr. Garofalo told Navy Times. \u201cWhat I did I\u2018m ashamed of, and I didn\u2019t mean to cause so much disgrace to the SEALs.\u201dMr. Garofalo did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.Don Shipley, a retired SEAL who tracks down and reports those who fraudulently claim to have been part of the special operations force, said that an acquaintance contacted him after the segment aired and informed him that it had included a Vietnam veteran who was a SEAL.\u201cThat is the first red flag that goes up,\u201d Mr. Shipley said in an interview Friday, remarking on how few SEALs served in Vietnam. The first SEAL teams were created in the early 1960s, and few were deployed in the early years of the Vietnam War.Mr. Shipley obtained Mr. Garofalo\u2019s military records and discovered he was an impostor. He then contacted Mr. Garofalo directly and confronted him. Mr. Garofalo admitted that he had lied and said that he was going to contact Fox and ask for the story to be retracted.But Fox did not retract the story, even after Mr. Shipley called the network himself to report what he had found. The segment was watched more than 1.5 million times on Facebook.In its statement, Fox said that \u201cover the last two weeks, we\u2019ve worked with Garofalo\u2019s family and the National Personnel Records Center to get to the bottom of a military past that Garofalo had claimed to be covert.\u201dMilitary records show that Mr. Garofalo served in the Navy. After graduating from basic training, he reported to a naval station in Virginia in 1963, and later served in Rota, Spain. He left the Navy in 1967.His sole decoration was a National Defense Service Medal, which is awarded to any service member who serves honorably during a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d including during the Vietnam War.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recovery, Russell Brand Style", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "ProfileThe comedian on narcissism, fame, his new book on the 12 steps and life after addiction.Supported byI am taking a tour of Russell Brand\u2019s body. It\u2019s not the one I might once have imagined, because I am old and he is no longer a sex addict. But we are examining his tattoos. There are many. He does not seem to mind unbuttoning his shirt, covered in galloping stallions, for a stranger. The chakras traveling down his right arm represent \u201cthe sexual energy, the energy of the will, the energy of the heart, the energy of communication \u2026\u201d he explained, touching each one lightly. There is the sex-energy kundalini serpent (do you sense a theme here?) on his right index finger. There\u2019s one on his bicep that he and the singer Katy Perry got when they married that says \u201cGo with the flow\u201d in Sanskrit. They couldn\u2019t, but it was a nice thought. My favorite, though, is a quote that Mr. Brand attributed to Oscar Wilde, in loopy script that stretches from Mr. Brand\u2019s shoulder to his wrist: \u201cIf you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh. Otherwise they\u2019ll kill you.\u201dMr. Brand\u2019s thinking about addiction goes something like this: At the root of all addiction is narcissism, a constant thrumming attention to self. If you are self-absorbed you are suffering, and if you suffer you seek ways to stop it \u2014 through drugs, alcohol, sex, maybe Facebook \u201clikes.\u201d\u201cWe are trying to solve inner problems externally \u2014 whatever it is in our lives that is missing,\u201d he said. \u201cEckhart Tolle said it perfectly: \u2018Addiction starts with pain and ends with pain.\u2019 Here\u2019s the point. Drugs, booze, sex \u2026 It\u2019s not the particular addiction that matters as much as the fact that your life is out of control because of it.\u201cI think of addiction as a kind of mutating and morphing germ,\u201d Mr. Brand said, \u201ccontinually varying in my life. But the sensation is the continuum. The experience is the continuum.\u201dHealing, he says, requires a belief in giving yourself to a higher power, however you understand it \u2014 because your own volition hasn\u2019t served you very well, has it? Mr. Brand is someone who hasn\u2019t done well with authority, so he invites us not to think of a higher power, or even just someone else\u2019s power, as domineering and negative, but instead \u201cas a place for nurture.\u201d Mr. Brand doesn\u2019t entirely turn his back on the religious foundation of 12-step programs, but he has found a universal \u201cworkaround.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to create territory to have a different conversation about spirituality, for people who are naturally humanist, or atheist. Or people who are just cynical.\u201d The recovery tent is big, he says. Step inside.Mr. Brand became a bounder with growing fame; his taste for chocolate, heroin, sex and chaos was legendary, and he left enemies in his wake, both professional and personal. Really, it was quite impressive. Rarely will you read of a person with such a genius for antagonizing authority. This gift hasn\u2019t exactly faded with time: At the 2013 GQ Awards, he noted (before he was escorted from the premises) that the sponsor Hugo Boss made uniforms for the Nazis \u2014 \u201cBut they looked fantastic!\u201dMr. Brand has been sober now for 14 years. As bad as he was as a student, he was brilliantly diligent in working the steps of recovery. He spent days locked in a room for Step 4, for example, the part about making a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. And when it came to making amends to people \u2014 well, imagine how many amends a celebrity with unfettered access to women has to make. \u201cMany didn\u2019t want to hear from me,\u201d he admitted. But his purpose in explaining the details of his recovery are to show that anyone, no matter how lost they are, can do it. As he explained in his rationale for writing this book: \u201cMy qualification is not that I am better than you, but that I am worse.\u201dNot that his struggles are entirely behind him. You can abstain entirely from drugs and alcohol, but as to those addictions that are \u201clife-giving\u201d \u2014 namely food and sex \u2014 he imposes structure. He is a vegan, with the occasional lapse of an egg; and since he believes that it is responsible for the commodification and objectification of women, there is no pornography allowed.A happy outgrowth of his recovery is what he calls the \u201cnew territory\u201d of domesticity: his wife, Laura Gallacher, and their 10-month-old daughter, Mabel.\u201cHe wants to eat life to death, in the most loving way imaginable. Which I identify with, because that\u2019s I think what I used to want to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Talk Shows?\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The envelope was innocuous enough, addressed to me at the \u201cNY Times\u201d in New York, though some soul in the mail department had obviously opened it, marked it \u201cpersonal\u201d and forwarded it to our Washington office.It was May 3 \u2014 five months ago. I was strangely happy to receive the letter, since most hate mail comes via email and Twitter, and handwritten (or hand-typed) letters \u2014 at least the ones that aren\u2019t from people in correctional facilities \u2014 usually say nice things.Wrong. \u201cDear Helene: You have the worst wardrobe of all the newscasters, male or female, on all of the networks and cable channels. Could you PLEASE get some help and start wearing jackets to cover up your fat arms? Could you not wear beach wear on Sunday a.m. talk shows? What are you thinking? Get a consultant to help you, please!!\u201dIt was signed: \u201cA viewer who is driven insane by your attire.\u201dWhat the heck? Okay, so I am not Tyra Banks, but I have always considered myself a fashionista by the low standards of the print journalism profession. That was one of the reasons I went the newspaper route instead of TV. I had taken a TV course in college and realized quickly that the time I was spending working to modulate my voice, put on lipstick and pour myself into shift dresses was time away from actual reporting. I quickly scurried back to print, where I \u2014 alongside my kinky locks, dangly earrings and cargo pants paired with Prada-outlet-purchased heels \u2014 was not only accepted but viewed as fashionable.Except now, as more print newspaper reporters are showing up on TV talking about stories, new avenues of criticism are opening up. It\u2019s not just emails complaining that I spelled \u201csergeant\u201d wrong or called a Marine \u201csoldier.\u201d (I cover the Pentagon so there\u2019s a lot of that in my bloopers file.)These days, my mail includes telephone messages wondering why I wore a white blouse to talk about Chuck Hagel getting fired as defense secretary on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d emails wondering whether I\u2019m wearing the same necklace as the late Gwen Ifill on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and Facebook messages from family friends purporting to be proud I\u2019m on TV while also offering up commentary that I shouldn\u2019t wear my favorite black leather jacket when talking about Iran\u2019s nuclear program.But the beachwear and fat arms hand-typed letter stood out. I googled the return address and found a satellite street image of an ugly red pickup truck parked in a nondescript yard, which told me, well, nothing actually.I love my beachwear \u2014 these cute completely insubstantial crocheted cover-ups that come to the elbows. I have eight of them in different colors, all purchased on Folegandros, this island in Greece that I go to every summer, for $15 each. The whole reason I buy them is to cover up my fat arms on TV. Apparently I was damned if I did and damned if I didn\u2019t.How had Mr. or Mrs. Red Pickup Truck deduced that? After parading the letter around the office in a futile search for reassurance from my guffawing colleagues \u2014 do men get such missives? \u2014 I took to social media where my Facebook friends were bound to do a better job of buoying me up.Over the past months, looking for people (other than myself for eating too many bowls of Jollof rice) to blame for the letter, I\u2019ve settled on the city of Washington D.C., where I live and work.The city is too conservative for my haphazard style. Go to Capitol Hill and it\u2019s a sea of Ann Taylor low-heeled pumps and Talbot\u2019s suits.In recent years, Washington has played host to two First Ladies \u2014 Michelle Obama and now Melania Trump \u2014 who have pushed the envelope of what women wear here. But remember the stir when Mrs. Obama bared her arms in her first official photo as First Lady? Or the recent social media storm when Mrs. Trump wore stilettos to a hurricane?Clearly, I\u2019ve decided, Washington can\u2019t handle too much fashion forwardness. A couple of years ago, I tried on a pair of gorgeous deep red laced-up ankle boots in Paris, and the guy at the cash register stopped me as I was handing him my credit card.\u201cYou live in Washington? You will wear these there?\u201d he said, causing me to pause.I sighed. \u201cOkay, give me the black pair.\u201d I feel bitter about it every time I put on those black boots.My friend and I laughed about it, although I was secretly mad, and she sent me a pair of earrings that didn\u2019t dangle to wear next time I went on TV. I promised her I would wear them.But of course I didn\u2019t.Advertisement"}

Inside, they were crammed with cumin-spiced, tomato-spiked bulgur studded with flakes of good tuna and herbs. Perfectly balanced between sweet from the peppers and savory from the tuna, they were all anyone could ever want from a stuffed vegetable.Not only didn\u2019t Meline mind my excessive enthusiasm for her peppers, she even offered me the recipe. My only tweak was to add a spoonful of capers to add tangy bursts to the mild bulgur grains.For Meline\u2019s recipe, the fresh peppers are roasted until they collapse in on themselves in an autumnal-hued heap. This dish is prettiest if you can get mini sweet peppers in a variety of colors \u2014 yellow, orange and red, which is how they are generally sold in bags at the supermarket. If you\u2019re shopping at a farmers\u2019 market, you might find some green and purple ones, too.After roasting, you\u2019ll need to stuff each pepper individually. It seems like a lot of work, but it goes quickly. Slice open the peppers, then use your fingers to add the bulgur and close them up \u2014 as opposed to trying to spoon filling into the cavities. Don\u2019t worry about the peppers falling open on the plate; the bulgur filling binds them together. This sounds a lot more complicated than it is. Suffice it to say, you can make these in under an hour.Meline offered the stuffed peppers to us as a nibble with wine. But I could also see serving them with a big salad and some warm flatbread for a light supper. In which case, it wouldn\u2019t be at all rude to clean your plate.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the End of Israeli Democracy Nigh? Israelis Debate Its Future", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJerusalem MemoBut now that criticism is being leveled by former security officials and members of the right-wing establishment itself, including veterans of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s own political party and his Justice Department.They say that the government\u2019s efforts to control the news media, curtail the authority of the Supreme Court and undermine once-hallowed institutions like the military threaten the future of Israeli democracy. Their warnings have thrown Israel into an impassioned debate over what kind of country it is becoming, and if its democracy \u2014 now in its 70th year \u2014 can survive.A former chief of Shin Bet, the Israeli domestic security service, wrote in a newspaper column on Monday that if \u201cthe ethical and moral rot that leads us\u201d continues, \u201cthis incredible Zionist enterprise will expire.\u201dReuven Rivlin, the Israeli president, a largely ceremonial post meant to be above politics, warned that \u201cstatesmanship has come to an end\u201d and said Israel was \u201cwitnessing the winds of a second revolution or coup.\u201d Mr. Rivlin comes from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s own party, Likud.Mr. Rivlin\u2019s speech last week, in particular, was widely considered an unprecedented political intervention.\u201cIt touched on an exposed nerve of many Israelis,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research center in Jerusalem. \u201cIsraelis are committed to Israel remaining a strong and vibrant democracy. However, there is a deep divide on how we interpret what democracy means.\u201dWhile some see other threats to Israeli democracy stemming from the military occupation of territories captured in the 1967 war, this latest debate is more internal, focusing on democracy within Israel\u2019s pre-1967 boundaries and coming after mounting episodes of what critics called new levels of toxicity and partisanship in the national discourse.There have been political moves to curb the influence of guardians of liberal values, including attacks on the news media, efforts to impose sanctions on human rights organizations deemed to act against Israel abroad, and attempts to advance legislation in Parliament to override decisions of the Supreme Court.\u201cIf we permit corruption to take hold in the Knesset,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto damage the separation of powers in the country and, worst of all, to infiltrate the most sensitive process in a democratic country \u2014 which is the process by which our elected officials are investigated \u2014 this incredible Zionist enterprise will expire.\u201dAnalysts say that the country is locked in a fundamental clash not between left and right but between the values of the founding generation of leaders who put the common good and the interests of the state first and a newer, more populist and partisan politics epitomized by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government.Mr. Rivlin, 78, and Mr. Netanyahu, 68, though only a decade apart, reflect these two Israels.Mr. Rivlin champions the old-school nationalist but liberal democracy envisioned by the right-wing Zionist Revisionist movement of Zeev Jabotinsky and Menachem Begin, who pushed for a greater Israel territorially but were sticklers for defending minority rights and the rule of law. Mr. Netanyahu is also a disciple of Mr. Jabotinsky and Mr. Begin, but analysts say he and many of his ministers reflect the brash political populism of the digital age.Mr. Rivlin did not mention Mr. Netanyahu by name but accused those in power of working to delegitimize and weaken \u201cthe gatekeepers of Israel\u2019s democracy,\u201d and, crucially for a country that lacks a constitution, erode the justice system and the influence of the courts.Mr. Rivlin, like other critics, accused the government of championing the will of the majority while weakening the institutions that protect the rights of the minority.\u201cWe are today witnessing the winds of a second revolution or coup,\u201d he said. The first one, which he said he also opposed, was a decision by the Supreme Court in the 1990s to overturn laws that contradicted Israel\u2019s Basic Laws. \u201cThis time,\u201d he said, \u201cit is the rule of the majority that is the sole ruler.\u201dNetanyahu loyalists saw the attack as an inside job. Some Likud politicians said that Mr. Rivlin \u201cis no longer one of us,\u201d and others suggested abolishing the presidency.Days later, at a swearing-in ceremony for the new president of the Supreme Court at Mr. Rivlin\u2019s official residence, Mr. Netanyahu was philosophical. Citing Montesquieu and Kant, he said, \u201cIn all democracies there is a perpetual and often stormy argument about demarcating the boundaries between the branches of government. That isn\u2019t a blow to democracy; that is the essence of democracy. It always exists.\u201dIn a conciliatory tone, Mr. Netanyahu emphasized the importance of a strong and independent Supreme Court. Quoting Cicero\u2019s description of the Jews of Rome 2,000 years ago as a \u201clitigious people,\u201d he added, \u201cNothing has changed. We argue, argue and argue again.\u201d The point, he said, was to create an \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201cdignified\u201d dialogue based on mutual respect.Mr. Netanyahu, who has been elected four times, leads what many describe as the most nationalist and illiberal government in Israel\u2019s history.\u201cThe democratic space is shrinking,\u201d she said.The government is dominated by right-wing and religious parties, while the opposition is divided and weak. That made Mr. Rivlin\u2019s voice all the more significant.\u201cThe left wing is attacking Netanyahu all day long but has no influence,\u201d said Avi Shilon, an Israeli historian who teaches at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and N.Y.U. Tel Aviv. \u201cYou need somebody from the right wing, from the roots of Revisionism.\u201dDaniel Gordis, an author and senior vice president of Jerusalem\u2019s Shalem College for the liberal arts, says he views much of what is happening in Israel \u201cin the shadow of the Trump administration.\u201d With all the differences in personality, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump have resorted to similar tactics, such as decrying the mainstream news media as purveyors of \u201cfake news.\u201dMr. Rivlin probably felt he had an obligation to speak up, Mr. Gordis said, because Israel was \u201cinching ominously toward a watershed moment.\u201d But unlike the United States, he added, \u201cIsrael is a 70-year-old democracy, not 250 years old.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghan Newspaper Hunts Corruption, but First It Has to Pay the Rent", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The first time Zaki Daryabi started a small newspaper in Afghanistan, it shut down within months. Mr. Daryabi, who had just graduated from university in Kabul, lost most of the money lent to him by friends to start his business.But soon after, he restarted the newspaper, Etilaat e Roz. And now, five years later, it has found itself in the middle of some of Afghanistan\u2019s most important national conversations.At the same time, though, Mr. Daryabi\u2019s journalists churn out investigative reports that stir what has become an increasingly chaotic Afghan democracy, with its warlords and ethnic factions often needing reminders of the rules of the new game and the role of the news media in it.The growth of the free Afghan news media is one of the biggest achievements since the toppling of the Taliban by an international coalition in 2001.Under the Taliban, there was only the regime\u2019s state radio and newspaper. Today, there are more than 300 radio and 200 television channels, more than 70 newspapers, and hundreds of magazines across Afghanistan.The numbers, however, often overshadow the draining work and risks these news organizations take.Newspapers in particular, most of which have been subsidized by donor funding over the past 15 years, face not just financial worries, but also the nagging question of whether they can really bring about change in a country where power often lies less in the constitutional order and more at the hands of strongmen and their patronage.Coping with the political pressures, and the financial challenges, is a daily struggle.For publishers like Mr. Daryabi, newspaper work means living a life of debt, and often making life awkward for loved ones. As his paper has published reports critical of President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s government, Mr. Daryabi\u2019s relationship with his father, a Ghani supporter, has become strained. His father does not understand why his son keeps embarrassing him in front of his friends.\u201cWhen I am sometimes thinking about leaving it all, it\u2019s not about myself \u2014 it\u2019s about my twins, and their future,\u201d said Mr. Daryabi, the father of twin boys.Etilaat e Roz operates out of a third-floor apartment in western Kabul, where a team of 10 starts late in the morning and works late into the night. The operation is so small that for major investigations Mr. Daryabi and his chief editor become reporters.Advertisements cover only about 30 percent of the paper\u2019s costs. Mr. Daryabi recently obtained a grant from Open Society Foundation for about $50,000, which will cover another 30 percent for the coming year.There have been weeks when the paper hasn\u2019t printed, simply putting the content online. During one of those stretches last year, Mr. Daryabi admits, he came closest to the lure of political money \u2014 accepting a onetime payment of $3,000 from former President Hamid Karzai\u2019s foundation, arranged by one of his editors, who had once worked in the president\u2019s office and told him that the paper was shutting down.Mr. Daryabi\u2019s team, after much internal debate, accepted the money and put it toward the rent.It has also investigated the sale by Mr. Ghani\u2019s administration of a large section of prime real estate in Kabul at a dirt-cheap price to an election supporter.Last week, the paper published a series of articles about ethnic favoritism in the presidential palace, a sensitive issue in a country that has long struggled with equality.For months, Mr. Daryabi\u2019s team and others had reported that Pashtuns made up the circle of people closest to Mr. Ghani\u2019s office, marginalizing other ethnic groups in the most important conversations.His paper found a document that was a smoking gun of sorts.A senior employee of Mr. Ghani\u2019s administrative office had shared a memo on an internal Telegram channel, highlighting how members of other ethnicities should be sidelined in favor of Pashtuns. Within minutes, the employee had written in the group again: \u201cwrong channel.\u201dIt was too late. The memo was leaked to the news media, and Mr. Daryabi\u2019s team picked on it, carefully documenting every step of their reporting, and knowing that the authenticity of a document on an explosive issue like ethnic prejudice would be questioned.The articles set off a week of intense debates across Afghan television channels and newspapers, and particularly on social media, where many lashed out at Mr. Daryabi and his paper.Daud Noorzai, the new head of Mr. Ghani\u2019s administrative office, insisted that the memo was the work of one individual and did not reflect the deeper thinking of the office he was leading. But that did not ease concerns about rot in the system.Mr. Ghani, who was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly at the time, ordered his attorney general to conduct an inquiry.To Mr. Daryabi and his team, Mr. Noorzai\u2019s acknowledgment of the problem and Mr. Ghani\u2019s promise of accountability were a much needed victory during another difficult stretch when they had been contemplating shutting their enterprise down.\u201cIn an environment where being branded and stamped as partisan is so common, we want our newspaper to stand for one thing: a newspaper,\u201d said Khalil Pajhwok, the chief editor. \u201cWe are after earning trust as a professional media that doesn\u2019t take sides, and that means we have to do trustworthy work, without censorship, that is factual.\u201dMr. Daryabi was raised in a village in Jaghori, an enigma district of sorts that has a robust culture of books and ideas in an otherwise restive Ghazni Province. He is 31, based on the date his father scribbled on the back of the family\u2019s copy of the Quran.Or he is 28, based on how old the district governor thought he looked when he signed Mr. Daryabi\u2019s ID card and officially registered his age when he began his university studies in Kabul.As a student of political science, Mr. Daryabi started writing articles for a local newspaper, getting paid about $5 a piece. After graduation, he cobbled together about $16,000 from friends and family to start Etilaat e Roz, which in its first incarnation largely focused on entertainment.After it closed, Mr. Daryabi, who does not speak much English, was called by a printing house to lead an English paper started primarily to make money from advertisements. Mr. Daryabi took the job on the condition that he could use the company\u2019s resources to restart Etilaat e Roz. They had a deal.After a year of running two newspapers, he could afford to work full-time on Etilaat e Roz, which now focused on politics.Mr. Daryabi said that in those days, in 2012, there was more optimism about the country\u2019s future and the media\u2019s role in it.But the difficult years since \u2014 with a messy election that threatened to break the country apart, a violent Taliban onslaught and his paper\u2019s financial issues \u2014 have not beaten him down completely, he said.\u201cThe raw material for a democracy is still there,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article omitted the given name of Etilaat e Roz\u2019s chief editor. He is Khalil Pajhwok.Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wildfires Spared the Vineyards, but the Wines Could Suffer", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut as the smoke has begun to clear in recent days, those who depend on grape-growing and winemaking for a living have been relieved to find that the fires largely spared one crucial element in their path: the vineyards.Throughout the most beleaguered parts of Napa and Sonoma Counties, the fires have left scorched, blackened fields and the occasional smoldering log. Almost invariably, though, they have left vineyards, the region\u2019s most precious resource, intact, with at worst a singeing around the fringes.Still, several days of visits to the worst-hit parts of Napa and Sonoma Counties indicated that despite a communal sense of relief that the worst had been dodged, the fires have created serious concerns for the near future. Potential damage to the grapes, which may take months or years to show itself, could affect the supply and quality of some of this year\u2019s vintage.A map shows the origin and extent of a fire that burned 5,200 buildings in hours.\u201cWe have a couple of weeks when the world is interested in us, and then the next disaster will strike and we\u2019ll be on our own,\u201d he said.A less tangible concern is that the roiling smoke that hovered over the region could somehow damage grapes that were not yet harvested.Initial reports after the fires began suggested that much of the vintage had already been harvested. That was true of the white grapes. But many fine-wine producers in Napa and Sonoma still had red grapes hanging \u2014 particularly those for the riper, more voluptuous style that dominate in California, especially in Napa Valley. For many producers, as much as 30 percent of their Bordeaux varieties like cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc, and Rh\u00f4ne grapes like grenache, had yet to be harvested.One thing is clear: A perception among consumers that the 2017 vintage is tainted would be bad for business, leading some producers to avoid discussing whether they still had grapes on the vines.Thirty percent of his estate cabernet grapes were still hanging a few days into the fires. Like many other producers, Frog\u2019s Leap is processing the grapes picked after the fires started separately from those harvested before so that any potential taint will be confined.The issue is more complicated than smoke residue settling on the skins of grapes. The interaction with smoke can cause chemical compounds to form within the grapes. At first, these compounds may be undetectable by taste or smell. They may become volatile during fermentation, or it may not be until much later, months or years, that they become evident.Winemakers cannot simply wash the grapes. Instead, they send grapes, juice or wine to laboratories, which test for indications of these compounds.Fear of smoke taint can force changes in winemaking protocols. Frog\u2019s Leap depends on naturally occurring yeast to ferment its red grapes, Mr. Williams said, but manufactured yeast can be purchased that is said to either mask the smoke taint \u2014 if it exists \u2014 with fruity flavors or curtail the release of the smoky flavors.In addition, the grapes can be handled more delicately than usual. Ordinarily, Frog\u2019s Leap would pump the fermenting juice over the grape skins regularly to extract as much color, flavor and texture as possible. The skins remain with the juice until fermentation is complete, and then they are pressed to extract a little bit more. But with these grapes, Mr. Williams suggested, Frog\u2019s Leap could do fewer pumpovers and press the skins before fermentation is complete. This might lead to other issues, like a loss of color and flavor.Still other decisions loom. Producers may decide to use more heavily charred barrels to age these wines. The char will cause the wine to taste more oaky, but, since oak contains the same active compound found in smoke taint, albeit in a more agreeable form, it might mask any potential flaw.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make hard decisions if we want to make great wines,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThirty percent of our cabernet business is a big hit.\u201dReminders of the fires are all over the wine country. Wide swatches of umber dirt \u2014 fire breaks bulldozed through fields and woods, to cordon the flames off \u2014 scar the countryside. The bulldozers have carved up numerous paved mountain roads, their metal tracks leaving ruts that will shake passenger vehicles for some time to come.Sam Coturri worked to save his parents\u2019 house. With colleagues, he dug a fire break with a backhoe and hosed down the wooden structure. He has hired a crisis counselor to help the 100 vineyard management employees, some of whom lost homes and many of whom are immigrants.\u201cI\u2019ve always known how much I owe to a largely immigrant work force,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned this week how much of a responsibility I have to them as well.\u201dAs with any agricultural enterprise, the work of making wine must go on regardless of interruptions, even one as profound and traumatic as the fires. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the bigger story yet,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cWe have to take care of our people, make the best wine we can possibly make and get the vineyards ready for winter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You\u2019ll Wear What They Tell You to Wear", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Way We Shop NowSubscription clothing services should make you feel great. Shouldn\u2019t they? The authors Emily Gould and Rumaan Alam investigate.As so many emotional journeys do, this one began with me expressing disgust on Twitter. In this instance, I was angry about the proliferation of lifestyle-touting subscription clothing services. I\u2019d recently seen ads for Bombfell on the subway (\u201cIf shopping isn\u2019t your bag, you\u2019re going to love our box\u201d) and hit a personal tipping point.Clothing delivery services seem somehow dystopian, and although I was freaked out by them, I didn\u2019t fully understand why. Twitter people rushed to fill me in, as I\u2019d hoped they would. Clothing subscriptions provide a utilitarian uniform for cubicle-bound automatons, people said. They enforce a kind of fascistic conformity, like Mao suits but more cheaply made and less chic. They infantilize us in the same way that meal kit delivery services do: by replacing labor done by someone who might care how we\u2019re fed or what we\u2019re wearing (say, a loving parent) with labor done by workers at the bottom rung of a start-up, or even maybe by an algorithm designed to take key words and turn them into outfits. It sounded so much worse than I\u2019d even imagined, and of course this made me want to find out more. So Rumaan Alam and I decided to make ourselves his \u2019n\u2019 hers guinea pigs in a harrowing experiment: Together, we would try out the experience of several of the most popular subscription services. We would take notes on our experiences and compare them. In doing so, we would learn a truth. Are clothing subscriptions the Soylent of fashion \u2014 or are they maybe just a fun and convenient new way to shop?The deal: Seven days to return before you get charged; average price, $89 an article.RUMAAN: Newfangled clothing subscription services are at heart good old-fashioned businesses, in that they make so many promises that it\u2019s impossible to keep them all. If you have someone at home all day or your UPS driver knows where to hide boxes behind your garage, the promise is convenience. If you live far from any stores or simply don\u2019t have time to shop, the promise is access. If you feel overwhelmed by shopping, the promise is attention. If you feel underwhelmed by shopping, the promise is novelty. If you don\u2019t care about fashion, they\u2019ll care for you; if you do care about fashion, they\u2019ll be your clothes buddy. Like so many entities that pledge to disrupt, the subscription service model exchanges one set of hassles for another, more modern, set of hassles. Spend time with the computer instead of a sales clerk. Visit the post office instead of your local shop.My first subscription was to Bombfell, the ubiquitous Instagram advertiser that sounds like a Roger Moore-era Bond film. The enrollment process emphasizes the user over the clothing; you describe your body type, your general style, and indicate anything you know you have no interest in, like boot-cut jeans or graphic tees. (Check, and check.) I am someone who is interested in fashion, which doesn\u2019t put me outside Bombfell\u2019s target demographic, because what the company sells is something I\u2019m interested in too: ease. I appreciate that the delivery was fast and the customer service attentive. The pricing was not an issue because you pay only if you keep the clothes Bombfell sends you and I returned everything. In my enrollment, I told Bombfell that I was simply too busy to shop, that I had a modern sense of style. They sent me a long sleeve tee, a chambray shirt, a pair of brown pants and a pair of faded black jeans, all perfectly serviceable. This was more like the clothing a mother might choose for an adult son, rather than what I expect from a stylist, even if that\u2019s just a term of art for a customer service representative. Especially galling, I thought, was the long sleeve tee, which Bombfell assured me was a design that was theirs alone. Exclusivity is meant to be alluring, but it\u2019s hard not to reason that per some arrangement, every customer, no matter his style or needs, is going to be sent this particular garment. Part of this site\u2019s appeal is, I think, its prices, but I refuse to pretend that $68 is a fair price for a cotton tee.EMILY: I started with Le Tote because I get served its Instagram ads most often, and because one Twitter dissenter had mentioned finding it useful when starting a new job. It also seemed to be the cheapest and most flexible of all the services; you can wear the clothes for as long as you want and then send them back, which spurs the shipment of a new box, purportedly styled just for you. All the options it showed for outfits you would potentially wear seemed irretrievably wack to me, but Le Tote does allow you to choose what\u2019s in your shipment from a set of options, to which it adds a few \u201cfun\u201d extras. My first Tote contained a striped shirt, a faux suede moto jacket, a pair of leggings with Nike written up the side, and (fun!) a vending-machine-quality ring and a floral scarf. The whole thing cost $147, if I wanted to buy it all, which I did not; $147 seemed expensive, considering the plastic fast-fashion quality of the clothes in it.I was left with one burning question. Is Le Tote a play on words? A \u201clitotes\u201d is a figure of speech that uses deliberately exaggerated understatement to make a point, like \u201cnot bad\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not my first rodeo.\u201d Like \u201cLe Tote clothes aren\u2019t the best I\u2019ve ever worn.\u201d I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not a play on words, actually.The deal: You\u2019re sent five things, you try them, return what you don\u2019t like. Bonus fun: You get 25 percent off if you buy all five.RUMAAN: Stitch Fix is in the business of style more than convenience. You can hear it in the very name, the notion that your wardrobe is something that can be fixed, and that will in turn fix your life. The style questionnaire is more rigorous than Bombfell\u2019s, more granular, and I could imagine my fellow consumers answering those queries mindful of what the right articles of clothing might do for them. That\u2019s part of fashion\u2019s promise, that a girlfriend or boyfriend or a promotion are just one tie or sweater or pair of shoes away. Bombfell emphasizes its personal touch, showing you a head shot of the stylist who\u2019s assisting you. Stitch Fix doesn\u2019t work quite the same way; you\u2019re welcome to send a note to your stylist, but to me it felt like sending a note to an algorithm. Anyway, I requested some blazers. I was sent two, both perfectly serviceable if not quite what I want in a blazer. The trade-off for the convenience of trying something on at home is that you don\u2019t have access to much variety. Presumably, over time, your stylist (or the algorithm) will learn to anticipate your tastes, the way we\u2019re told online advertising works. Of course, when I\u2019m online, I find I see mostly advertisements for things I\u2019ve already bought.My husband tried on one of the blazers and declared that he wanted it. It was only when I pointed out that it was $200 that he noticed that the shoulder didn\u2019t fit quite right, that the cut was not altogether flattering. The deal: You approve your trunk preview, and after it arrives you have five days to return or buy the six to 10 items in a trunk. EMILY: I next tried Trunk Club Women, also based on Twitter recommendation \u2014 this one from a woman who swore that the app\u2019s stylist had heeded her very specific requests and that she\u2019d ended up buying several of the items from her first trunk. Unlike Le Tote, Trunk Club is expensive. You also get to have a chat with a person who is definitely not a bot about your style preferences. I actually loved this process so much. Doubters (like Rumaan!) told me, \u201cWell, you could have that experience at any department store, especially at Nordstrom, which owns Trunk Club.\u201d But the illusory intimacy of digital interaction made me so much more honest with Sophie, the stylist, than I would have ever been with a stranger IRL. Very quickly, she learned about me that I teach undergrad creative writing, that I almost never wear florals or bright colors, that I usually wear boots or sneakers and jeans and a button-front shirt, and that I still have a postpartum gut even though my son is 2\u00bd.I admitted that I was unlikely to ever wear anything bodycon and described my ideal aspirational aesthetic as \u201crich L.A. lesbian.\u201d The results were so shockingly on point that there were two items in my first Trunk preview that I had to delete, not because I didn\u2019t like them, but because I already owned them. The experience of trying all these clothes on at home instead of in a Nordstrom dressing room, however, was not actually that luxurious. I found the box big and daunting, and it sat around unopened for days while I waited to have enough time set aside to do a little in-home fashion show for myself. But five days is all you get with Trunk Club, and once its emails started to take on a slightly chiding tone, I worried that the company would charge my credit card for thousands of dollars worth of clothes. So late one afternoon, I opened the box. I made yes, no and maybe piles, and there was a very cozy cashmere/wool blend long sleeve Vince sweater dress in the maybe pile that seemed like the kind of thing that might be worth its $400 price tag. I was in the process of trying it on a second time when disaster struck. I had been standing on my coffee table to look in my apartment\u2019s only mirror, and without warning the table collapsed underneath me! My first concern, as I assessed the damage, after I determined that I hadn\u2019t sustained anything worse than a big, rapidly purpling butt bruise, was that the scrape on my hand had maybe gotten some blood on the dress. It hadn\u2019t, but the dress seemed somehow tainted anyway. I ended up sending it back. I also sent back a denim pencil skirt, a Bond-villainess scuba dress and a white silk top that had looked a little bit frumpy even on the lissome teenager who modeled it on the website. I kept a soft cropped sweater and a black velvet Eileen Fisher T-shirt that I wore later that week to a dinner to celebrate my 36th birthday, which seemed appropriate. The deal: For a $60 flat fee, you\u2019re sent a couple of new items each month.Stitch Fix and Bombfell use technology and language to reinvent the low-end and midrange department store experience. FiveFour Club is more like a web version of a boutique with a subscription model thrown in for good measure. Instead of appealing to customers with the siren song of a personal stylist, FiveFour charges a price of admission in exchange for regular deliveries of its own branded clothing. (There is also a web store, membership not required.) The aesthetic here is minimal, sporty and young, so fashion-aware that it\u2019s hard to envision who the consumer is. While it\u2019s true we don\u2019t all live in ZIP codes with street wear boutiques, the same person who logs onto FiveFour can log on to eBay. In exchange for my $60 membership fee, I was sent a windbreaker and a tee, both in lackluster shades of brown. On a lanky 19-year-old, they\u2019d look stylish. On anyone else, they look like two garments that cost $30 each.Wouldn\u2019t I like to be a lanky 19-year-old? Of course. Fashion is about fantasy. Here in reality, FiveFour got my $60 and I\u2019ve got these clothes I\u2019ll never wear. Those few of us who never read Marie Kondo still have those fashionable mistakes lurking in our closets. I\u2019m sort of fond of them, those past selves that never came to be. I\u2019ve spent many hours of my life browsing in stores. At 21, I admired clothes I couldn\u2019t afford. At 30, I bought them. At 40, I sometimes go simply for the pleasure, of seeing what is new, of learning what counts as beautiful now. So what, if anything, have we learned? One old lesson, at least. Shopping for clothes is time consuming, it\u2019s tiring, and it can feel like a waste of an autumn afternoon. So you can subscribe to a service that makes your life simpler, although it may come at the expense of expressing who you are. You can also subscribe to the notion that there\u2019s still pleasure in some of life\u2019s chores. In the flesh, you can touch a wool jacket or a cashmere sweater as you imagine who you might be if each belonged to you.Advertisement"}

She ended up offering to bring wine to his screening of Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cBullets Over Broadway.\u201dFor the past 10 years, Mr. Zagottis has drawn countless passers-by to a small triangle on the corner of 46th Street and Newtown Road. It is where movies are shown, he said, \u201cthe way they were supposed to be seen\u201d: on a big screen, with the right aspect ratio, no pause button and, most important, with other people.On a recent Saturday, Mr. Zagottis, 54, took the stage \u2014 well, really, the back staircase \u2014 like a director introducing his magnum opus. \u201cWelcome,\u201d he said, waving his arms, \u201cto the Newtown Road Backyard Film Festival!\u201dEach season, which generally runs from June to October, has a theme, like \u201cOrdinary People in Extraordinary Circumstances\u201d (\u201cOrdinary People,\u201d \u201cStrangers on a Train\u201d) or \u201cFound Humorous by the 10 Percent\u201d (\u201cThe Birdcage,\u201d \u201cVictor/Victoria\u201d). Mr. Zagottis had a particularly stressful time this year and so deemed 2017 \u201cThe Year of No-Brainers.\u201d The current season is scheduled to conclude \u2014 unless Mr. Zagottis decides to add more screenings \u2014 with \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d on Oct. 15.The festival has three rules: no talking, no phones, and, after an incident or two, no alcohol. Another Zagottis mandate: \u201cI always have a Hitchcock.\u201dThis season it was \u201cThe Trouble With Harry,\u201d and on a recent evening, right before the Hitchcock screened, Mr. Zagottis delivered his usual introduction: \u201cIt is a comedy \u2014 of course, a dark comedy.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe trouble with Harry is that he\u2019s dead!\u201d He then added a bit of trivia: \u201cThis is also Shirley MacLaine\u2019s screen debut.\u201dBefore the movie started, a short video featuring Mr. Zagottis\u2019s father preparing the festival fabric played, as it does before every screening.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re watching SoftBank to see if the Japanese conglomerate really wants Sprint to walk away from a T-Mobile deal, or if it\u2019s all merely negotiating tactics. More on that in a minute.Russia is Topic A in the Senate today, especially with lawyers for Facebook, Google and Twitter set to testify before the Judiciary Committee. We expect Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, and other members to ask hard questions about:\u2022 When the tech giants knew the full extent of Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 election\u2022 What they intend to do to stop that from happening again \u2014 a tricky job for companies seeking to both preserve free speech and ward off further regulation.Russian agents intending to sow discord among American citizens disseminated inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google\u2019s YouTube service.Today, the rise of populist movements in both parties has forced a reckoning around the concentration of economic power in big businesses. Populist conservatives are particularly hostile to big tech, given its size and pervasive influence, as well as its support for immigration rights and other causes that clash with their economic nationalism.Let\u2019s face it: Despite the impending tax plan rollout and the picking of a nominee for Federal Reserve chairman, Washington will still be largely talking about the criminal charges that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates face in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.Some of those conversations will concern Tom Barrack, one of President Trump\u2019s closest advisers, who has emerged as connected to the two men. Could that see him pushed out of the White House inner circle?Some White House advisers are unhappy with Thomas J. Barrack Jr., Trump\u2019s longtime friend and chair of his inauguration, whom they hold responsible for keeping Gates in the Trump orbit long after Manafort resigned as campaign chairman in August 2016, according to people familiar with the situation. Barrack has been Gates\u2019s patron of late, steering political work to him and, until Monday, employing him as director of the Washington office of his real estate investment company.\u201cIn the midst of such a major investigation, it\u2019s inappropriate for me to have any comment until the process has finished its course.\u201dThe latest question is whether the corporate tax rate should go down to 20 percent from 35 percent immediately or in stages.Other challenges \u2022 Remember that Republicans can\u2019t lose more than two senators to pass the tax legislation without Democratic votes.The point here is that the Trump administration is shifting away from the president\u2019s own words. They\u2019re not saying the rich shouldn\u2019t get any tax relief \u2014 they\u2019re saying the rich deserve to get one.Worth readingThe question is whether SoftBank really intends to walk away. We\u2019ve heard that the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s board is unhappy with the prospect of losing control in a merger: At a board meeting last Friday, several directors questioned whether it was wise to take only about 40 percent of the combined wireless business \u2014 a smaller amount than Deutsche Telekom \u2014 because T-Mobile is currently bigger than Sprint.We\u2019ve seen hardball negotiating tactics from SoftBank and Masayoshi Son before: The Japanese conglomerate expressed interest in buying the cable company Charter Communications earlier this year before resuming talks with T-Mobile.Critics\u2019 corner\u2022 Credit Suisse named Steven Geller as its head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, according to an internal memo.

{"Headline": "How Twitter Killed the First Amendment", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou need not be a media historian to notice that we live in a golden age of press harassment, domestic propaganda and coercive efforts to control political debate. The Trump White House repeatedly seeks to discredit the press, threatens to strip broadcasters of their licenses and calls for the firing of journalists and football players for speaking their minds. A foreign government tries to hack our elections, and journalists and public speakers are regularly attacked by vicious, online troll armies whose aim is to silence opponents.In this age of \u201cnew\u201d censorship and blunt manipulation of political speech, where is the First Amendment? Americans like to think of it as the great protector of the press and of public debate. Yet it seems to have become a bit player, confined to a narrow and often irrelevant role. It is time to ask: Is the First Amendment obsolete? If so, what can be done?These questions arise because the jurisprudence of the First Amendment was written for a different set of problems in a very different world. The First Amendment was ignored for much of American history, coming to life only in the 1920s thanks to the courage of judges like Learned Hand, Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Courts and civil libertarians used the amendment to protect speakers from government prosecution and censorship as it was practiced in the 20th century, such as the arrest of pamphleteers and the seizure of anarchist newspapers by the Post Office.The Russian government was among the first to recognize that speech itself could be used as a tool of suppression and control. The agents of its \u201cweb brigade,\u201d often called the \u201ctroll army,\u201d disseminate pro-government news, generate false stories and coordinate swarm attacks on critics of the government. The Chinese government has perfected \u201creverse censorship,\u201d whereby disfavored speech is drowned out by \u201cfloods\u201d of distraction or pro-government sentiment. As the journalist Peter Pomerantsev writes, these techniques employ information \u201cin weaponized terms, as a tool to confuse, blackmail, demoralize, subvert and paralyze.\u201dOur distressing state of public discourse stems from the widespread use of these new tools of censorship and speech control, including by the White House. The administration habitually crosses the line between fact and propaganda. Instead of taking action itself, it demands that others punish its supposed enemies. To add to the mess, it is apparent that the Russian government and possibly others hope to manipulate American political debate, as its exploitation of Facebook and Twitter in the last election shows.What can be done? It is time to recognize that the American political process and marketplace for ideas are under attack, and that reinvigorating the First Amendment is vital. First, it is an imperative that law enforcement and lawmakers do more to protect journalists and other public speakers from harassment and threats. Cyberstalking is a crime. And as the Supreme Court has made clear, threats of violence are not protected speech. A country where speaking one\u2019s mind always results in death threats is not a country that can be said to be truly free.Second, too little is being done to protect American politics from foreign attack. The Russian efforts to use Facebook, YouTube and other social media to influence American politics should compel Congress to act. Social media has as much impact as broadcasting on elections, yet unlike broadcasting it is unregulated and has proved easy to manipulate. At a minimum, new rules should bar social media companies from accepting money for political advertising by foreign governments or their agents. And more aggressive anti-bot laws are needed to fight impersonation of humans for propaganda purposes.Some might argue, based on the sophomoric premise that \u201cmore speech is always better,\u201d that the current state of chaos is what the First Amendment intended. But no defensible free-speech tradition accepts harassment and threats as speech, treats foreign propaganda campaigns as legitimate debate or thinks that social-media bots ought to enjoy constitutional protection. A robust and unfiltered debate is one thing; corruption of debate itself is another. We have entered a far more dangerous place for the republic; its defense requires stronger protections for what we once called the public sphere.An Op-Ed essay on Saturday about the First Amendment used an incorrect name for the government agency that seized anarchist newspapers in the early 20th century. It was the United States Post Office, not the United States Postal Service (the agency was renamed in 1971).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose Situation", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But so what? Hasn\u2019t that always been the case?As the men who run Silicon Valley will be the first to tell you, a company\u2019s size doesn\u2019t matter here. For every lumbering Goliath, there are always one or two smarter, faster Davids just now starting up in some fabled garage, getting ready to slay the giants when they least expect it.Well, maybe not this time.The technology industry is now a playground for giants. Where 10 or 20 years ago we looked to start-ups as a font of future wonders, today the energy and momentum have shifted almost completely to the big guys. In addition to the many platforms they own already, one or more of the Five are on their way to owning artificial intelligence, voice assistants, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, home automation, and every other cool and crazy thing that will rule tomorrow.The best start-ups keep being scooped up by the big guys (see Instagram and WhatsApp, owned by Facebook). Those that escape face merciless, sometimes unfair competition (their innovations copied, their projects litigated against). And even when the start-ups succeed, the Five still win.Because today\u2019s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don\u2019t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition \u2014 they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.The small guys won\u2019t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don\u2019t have the whole game won.They said the Five\u2019s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five\u2019s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren\u2019t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.\u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019d say it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, \u2018Why won\u2019t Microsoft do your business?\u2019 Then six years later it was, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Google do it?\u2019 Now it\u2019s a combination of why can\u2019t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?\u201dMr. Levin\u2019s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller\u2019s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day\u2019s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.IAC\u2019s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie\u2019s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five \u2014 both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that\u2019s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys \u2014 for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms \u2014 because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.\u201cWe think that a smart voice provider will say, \u2018If I want to win at all costs, we\u2019ll go get the very best partner\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s us,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn\u2019t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It\u2019s not betting on their demise; rather, it\u2019s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.IAC\u2019s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. \u201cI think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia \u2014 whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.\u201cI\u2019m mixed as it relates to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers \u2014 and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.\u201dBut like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here\u2019s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.Advertisement"}

Designated VC-25As by the Air Force, each jet is known as Air Force One, although the name is a radio call sign for whatever aircraft happens to be carrying the president.In the months since Mr. Trump has taken office, the White House has made moves to cut expenses, including buying two new 747-8 jets built for a Russian airline that went bankrupt before it could take delivery.\u201cWe are now working on the preliminary design review to modify those aircraft into a new Air Force One,\u201d said Ann Stefanek, an Air Force spokeswoman.The 89th Airlift Wing of the Air Force, based at Joint Base Andrews, runs the Air Force One program and 14 other special air mission platforms.This plane is most commonly used by the vice president \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cAir Force Two,\u201d if he\u2019s on board \u2014 as well as the first lady, members of the president\u2019s cabinet or members of Congress. Presidents use the plane when they fly to smaller airports with runways too short for a 747.Each of these 757s \u2014 the government has a fleet of four \u2014 contains a communications center and is divided into three other sections, including a state room, a conference area and a general seating area for up to 32 people.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who often rides on smaller planes, switched back to the 757 for a trip this past week to Asia. A maintenance problem forced him to make an unscheduled overnight stop in Tokyo, which in turn threatened his schedule of weekend meetings in China.The defense secretary is the most frequent passenger on this aircraft, known colloquially as the Doomsday Plane. It is essentially a flying high-tech bunker that would be an airborne command center for the president and his commanders in case of nuclear war.The plane, which contains a conference room and a middle section for traveling members of the news media, is one of the few civilian-built planes able to be refueled midair. There are at least four E-4Bs, and they are assigned to the 595th Command and Control Group at Offutt Air Base in Nebraska.Government officials visiting combat zones use this workhorse of an aircraft, which is capable of taking off and landing at steep pitches near battle zones.This smaller version of the 757 is used by government officials, including lately by Mr. Tillerson. The 89th Airlift Wing operates two of these jets.Mark Rosenker, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board and a director of the White House Military Office under President George W. Bush, described a rigid process.Cabinet members, he said, usually apply through the White House, where requests are typically approved by chiefs of staff or their deputies. Those requests, he said, are often turned down \u2014 for one, because of \u201cthe appropriateness of an airplane that is going to be flying on behalf of the U.S. government.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of assets to be giving every single cabinet member an airplane every time at their whim.\u201dMembers of Congress can obtain approval from the Defense Department to fly aboard military aircraft.Advertisement"}

In Britain, investigations have begun into the spread of misinformation on social media about the European Union membership referendum. In the United States, lawmakers are looking into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election on social media platforms.In Myanmar, Facebook is so dominant that to many people it is the internet itself. And the stakes of what appears on the site are exceptionally high because misinformation, as well as explicitly hostile language, is widening longstanding ethnic divides and stoking the violence against the Rohingya ethnic group.Facebook does not police the billions of posts and status updates that flow through the site worldwide each day, relying instead on an oftentimes confusing set of \u201ccommunity standards\u201d and reports by users of direct threats that are then manually assessed and, in some cases, removed.Facebook has no office in Myanmar, but the company has worked with local partners to introduce a Burmese-language illustrated copy of its platform standards and will \u201ccontinue to refine\u201d its practices, said a spokeswoman, Clare Wareing, in an emailed statement.Human rights groups say the company\u2019s approach has allowed opinion, facts and misinformation to mingle on Facebook, clouding perceptions of truth and propaganda in a country where mobile technology has been widely adopted only in the past three years.\u201cFacebook has become sort of the de facto internet for Myanmar,\u201d said Jes Kaliebe Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, Myanmar\u2019s leading technology hub that helped Facebook create its Burmese-language community standards page. \u201cWhen people buy their first smartphone, it just comes preinstalled.\u201dMr. Petersen said local media and news outlets should help combat misinformation in a technology sector still in its infancy.\u201cThere are still some challenges here, and there are of course very big differences between big cities and rural communities,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that people focus on educating this new generation of digital users.\u201dPosts from verified government and military Facebook accounts also carry misinformation. Some, for example, refuse to acknowledge the Rohingya as an ethnic group deserving of citizenship rights, despite the fact many have lived in Rakhine State for generations.The company\u2019s rules help to show how it distinguishes between free speech and hate speech. Judge for yourself.Ms. Wareing, the Facebook spokeswoman, said the company removed graphic content \u201cwhen it is shared to celebrate the violence.\u201d She said the company would allow graphic content if it was newsworthy, significant or important to the public interest, even if it might otherwise go against the platform\u2019s standards.Richard Weir, an Asia analyst with Human Rights Watch, said the situation was complicated.\u201cIt\u2019s a really delicate balance here between things that are violent and posted by people who would seek to inflame tensions and those that are trying to disseminate information,\u201d Mr. Weir said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know where exactly to draw the line.\u201dSome of the social media conversation is happening privately. For instance, chain messages on Facebook Messenger before Sept. 11 this year falsely warned of a planned Rohingya attack against Buddhists. Written like a chain letter, the message called for people to share it, and many people were put on edge as it spread.\u201cI was nervous about it,\u201d said U Tin Win, a teacher from Mandalay, the country\u2019s second-largest city, who received the letter. \u201cI don\u2019t know who started the message, but I ordered my family not to go outside that day.\u201dMr. Weir said that people in Myanmar relied on social media for their news.\u201cThe government can sort of trot out its own views and spread them very rapidly, in addition to a bunch of other nonstate entities,\u201d he said. \u201cViews about people in Rakhine State, about the origins of population and about things that may or may not have happened fly around Facebook extremely quickly and can create unstable situations.\u201dMegan Specia reported from New York, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.

To read his work was to see a gleeful spirit of muckraking, a fondness for 10,000-word posts and a penchant for grandstanding about his legal battles (he has filed two lawsuits seeking records).But not even Krebs\u2019s departure answered the larger questions that many who follow, fund and support New Mexico athletics were asking: Who is Daniel Libit, and what did the University of New Mexico ever do to him?\u201cI freely grant the strangeness of what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Libit, 34, said in an interview last month in the apartment he shares with his wife overlooking the Chicago River. \u201cI\u2019m in Chicago, and I\u2019m writing about a team that people shouldn\u2019t nationally care about.\u201dBut Libit, who wears a cropped haircut and an unmistakable swagger, is proudly unsentimental.\u201cPro sports fans are ready for someone to disappoint them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe college sports fan, by contrast, feels a mission to defend on every count against all evidence.\u201dGrammer, for one, praised his faraway rival.NM Fishbowl was born of disillusionment and opportunity. Libit, a New Mexico native, grew up a \u201cLobos basketball geek,\u201d he said, and his first job in journalism was an internship at the sports desk of an Albuquerque newspaper. But he fell out of love, he said, as he grew wise to what he characterized as college sports\u2019 inherent corruption.A University of Wisconsin graduate who has lived in Milwaukee, Washington and Chicago in a career that included writing for Politico and CNBC.com, Libit started more closely monitoring Lobos athletics in 2013, when he began frequently visiting his parents in New Mexico after his mother was found to have A.L.S. It is difficult not to notice emotional undercurrents to Libit\u2019s choice, which he did not dispute: His father died in 2014 and his mother early last year; both were huge Lobos fans.\u201cLike the scrutiny was so intense,\u201d Libit said, mocking the remark.The roots of Libit\u2019s cynicism reach down to a 2004 profile he wrote of the basketball coach Bruce Pearl for Milwaukee Magazine. It was standard fluff, Libit recalled, \u201ca little bit maudlin and silly, in that Mitch Albom way.\u201dCovering a relatively obscure and shallow-pocketed program, Libit said, actually helps prove his point about treating college sports as a business. \u201cIt brings into much starker relief financial mismanagement and the insanity of the tail wagging the dog of the university,\u201d he said. \u201cA million dollars matters at the University of New Mexico. A million dollars doesn\u2019t matter at Ohio State.\u201dAs NM Fishbowl approaches its first anniversary, Libit has no illusions about its potential profitability \u2014 many posts on the ad-free site earn only a few thousand readers \u2014 but he wonders if he has crafted a model for a traditional news media organization or a nonprofit to follow, perhaps taking dedicated looks at more prominent programs.\u201cFor all the cost-cutting measures and layoffs of local newspapers, there\u2019s still quite a few college sports reporters around the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all that\u2019s left to be done.\u201dB.J. Schecter, a professional-in-residence at Seton Hall University and formerly the editor who oversaw Sports Illustrated\u2019s college sports investigations, said that an expanded NM Fishbowl, or one focused on another program, would not lack for material.\u201cIf I look at college sports,\u201d Schecter said, \u201cI know I can go into just about any program \u2014 if I looked hard enough, I could find something.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Singing Waiters, Once Fired, Will Hit the Red Vinyl Stage Again", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySlinging sundaes and Be-Bop-a-Lula burgers, the singing waiters at Ellen\u2019s Stardust Diner near Times Square made vocal warm-ups out of their food orders \u2014 \u201cDo you want waffle fries with that?\u201d from the diaphragm \u2014 and practiced lip trills while running for things like ketchup. Their framed photographs lined the walls, \u201cStardusters\u201d given the billing of Broadway headliners.The diner is a kitschy place with a chrome-clad warmth that workers said was genuine. The quirky restaurant was to the singing workers a haven where Broadway hopefuls did more than belt out show tunes standing on the back of banquettes, several said in interviews. It was a place where they could make a living while striving for stages not upholstered in red vinyl.But more than a year ago, that began to change. The owner, Ken Sturm, brought in a new management team. Once-overlooked infractions, like sipping hot water on the restaurant floor to soothe tired vocal cords, were penalized, waiters said. The ability to take time off if a server landed an audition or a role, and return to a job at Ellen\u2019s, was no longer guaranteed. A tip bucket was taken away until workers complained.\u201cIt started to feel less like this was my safe place and more like this was something that was eating away at me a little bit,\u201d Lisa Kranz, 27, said. \u201cBut I still got to go to work every day with my friends \u2014 and sing.\u201dAfter a spate of firings that began in the summer of last year, distraught workers formed a union, Stardust Family United. A trio of waitresses announced the plans in September 2016, singing Twisted Sister\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It\u201d from the diner banquettes.A few weeks later, all three women were fired.In all, a total of 31 waiters were fired in what became a bitter battle between management and workers as they sought to unionize.In the fall of 2016, the workers took their complaints to the National Labor Relations Board, accusing management of union busting \u2014 doing things like surveilling them, preventing them from organizing on Facebook and threatening workers who took part in Stardust Family, all of which are covered by the National Labor Relations Act.Patrick McCarthy, a lawyer representing the restaurant, said the accusations were untrue. \u201cThe characterization of what happened is baseless,\u201d he said. The workers were fired not for unionizing, he said, but for cause: Starting in July 2016, the management became aware of what he said was an elaborate scheme in which waiters overcharged for sodas and coffees, stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from the restaurant over time, according to information the company provided to the labor board.\u201cIf you ask any employer in America, if they find out an employee is guilty of the conduct that was suspected here, what would they do?\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cThey would uniformly say we would discharge the person. It\u2019s as simple as stated in the Ten Commandments.\u201dThe company hired an outside consultant to look into its suspicions, and in July, sent the findings to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to say if it was investigating.After investigating the workers\u2019 claims, the board issued a complaint in April against the restaurant, authorizing a trial that was set for Tuesday.But days before the trial was to begin, a settlement was reached. Waiters who wanted their jobs back could have them, one of the terms of a settlement reached among workers, the restaurant and the board that also entitles all the fired workers to back pay dating to when they were fired.Of the 31 fired singers, 13 plan to return to Ellen\u2019s, while the rest chose not to. The restaurant has not admitted to any wrongdoing, and the workers who return will have their disciplinary records at the restaurant expunged.\u201cThey were basically completely vindicated,\u201d said Marianne LeNabat, a organizer with Industrial Workers of the World, an umbrella union of which Stardust Family is a part. \u201cThese illegal terminations and setbacks have never stopped the organizing that has gone on inside that restaurant. The fact that they weren\u2019t daunted by these firings is remarkable.\u201dAs the fired singers and management squared off, inside the diner, the show has gone on. Replacement singers were hired, and many of them have now joined the union, said Adam Rennie, 30, one of the few longtime workers who hung on to his job. The new servers will keep their jobs.For his part, Mr. Sturm sought to put the turbulence behind him. \u201cStardust has been a welcoming place in the heart of Times Square for employees, tourists and local patrons for over 30 years,\u2019\u2019 he said in an email. \u201cWe expect these 13 servers, who previously worked for Stardust, to fit in well into our supportive and inclusive work environment.\u2019\u2019Kevin Ray, 47, a server of 11 years who was fired in September 2016, plans to put on his black apron, climb once again atop a red vinyl booth and sing.His first number, he said, will be a pop ballad by the band Queen \u2014 \u201cWe Are the Champions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Going Against the Republican Herd", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year after President Trump\u2019s stunning electoral victory, the Republican Party is in a very strange place. It\u2019s politically dominant but increasingly unpopular, particularly among young people and nonwhites of all ages, whose level of unhappiness with Mr. Trump and his administration is toxic.When Mr. Bannon looks for targets as he prosecutes his \u201cseason of war,\u201d it is people like me he has in mind. And Mr. Bannon is right in this respect: Neither of us wants to be \u2014 or can be \u2014 a member of a party the other gets to define.It would be silly to deny that Mr. Bannon has several things working in his favor. To understand this, you have to forget about the narrowly decided presidential election for a minute and turn your mind back to the battle for the Republican nomination, which was not close at all. The first thing those of us who are vocal critics of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump need to recognize and fully reckon with is that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in the Republican primaries was not an aberration so much as a culmination, an apotheosis of sorts. Underlying currents and powerful passions animating the base of the party that had been building for years burst forth when Republicans nominated Mr. Trump.As the world now knows, these feelings of powerlessness, resentment and grievance are widespread, and as a candidate Mr. Trump tapped into them perfectly. Many Republican voters have, at least for now, jettisoned traditional conservatism in favor of the Trump-Bannon brand of ethnonationalism. They have turned inward instead out outward, they have embraced white identity politics as a matter of course and they have developed a disdain for the hard, intricate work of governing.But the reasons for the rise of Mr. Trump lie still deeper than that. There is a nihilistic strain coursing through the veins of a significant number of people on the American right. They delight in Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to annihilate truth and peddle conspiracy theories, and they draw energy and purpose from the unsettling effect he has on the nation as a whole. For them, Mr. Trump is a \u201cfighter,\u201d and politics needs to be weaponized in order to be enjoyed. They see politics as World Wrestling Entertainment, and Mr. Trump as the best wrestler in the ring.As a result, they are bending their will to his ways, seeing the world as he does. Take just one example that continues to startle: Russia. It wasn\u2019t long ago that Republicans were nearly unanimous in their critical outlook on Russia. But today, because of Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated praise for President Vladimir Putin, Republican attitudes toward Russia are far more favorable. A Pew Research Center poll found that the share of Republicans expressing confidence in Mr. Putin has doubled in just two years (from 17 to 34 percent).Republicans, then, are faced with an existential question. Will Mr. Trump and his most ardent supporters succeed in their effort to reconceive the party? Can they be stopped? Certainly, if they don\u2019t encounter more spirited resistance than they have so far, they may well pull it off.Let me explain what I mean. Some so-called establishment Republicans, alarmed by the rise of the ethnonationalist wing of the party, comfort themselves with the belief that this movement can be domesticated, absorbed into the traditional coalition with its sharp edges sanded off. According to this narrative, the Republican Party will weather this storm and emerge in a modified but recognizable form. There are bound to be tensions, but civil war can be averted.Count me skeptical. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, who get their news from Breitbart and Alex Jones, from conservative talk radio and Fox News, want a revolution, not accommodation. I\u2019m acquainted with some of these individuals and I hear from them all the time. Their rage at the establishment is off the charts. They want to burn the village down. Until now all the energy has been with them, and it is laughable to think that passing tax cuts will satiate them.That\u2019s why, for many of the lifelong Republican conservatives who never boarded the Trump train, it is particularly disappointing that the Republican leaders we know who have deep disagreements with Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon are for the most part unwilling to make the counter-case in a forceful and comprehensive fashion. Nor are his private critics rushing to go public with their often mordant analyses of Mr. Trump\u2019s movement.They each have their reasons, and some are more understandable than others. Still, I can\u2019t help but feel that they are badly underestimating the gravity of the moment. They are willfully ignoring the danger Trumpism and Bannonism pose to many of the principles they claim to hold dear, and they are deluding themselves into believing that a rapprochement is possible with those who are determined to destroy them.What this points to is the need for an energetic public case for a conservative politics as an alternative to their case for a revolutionary politics; for Republicans who don\u2019t share Mr. Bannon\u2019s manias to say so and to offer an alternative, in the area of policy but also in temperament and disposition. Thankfully that\u2019s beginning to happen. In the last week, former President George W. Bush, in whose White House I served, and Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, offered a philosophical alternative to Trumpism.Beyond that, though, there\u2019s really no choice about challenging the blood-and-soil nationalists. If they were to triumph \u2014 if the tribalistic, angry, anti-government wing of the party turns out to be the vanguard rather than an ugly and unfortunate parenthesis \u2014 then the Republican Party would collapse intellectually and morally, and a lot of lifelong Republicans would head for the exits.It may yet happen. A lot, frankly, depends on whether Mr. Trump is viewed as a success or a failure. If it\u2019s the former, his approach to politics will be imitated and become still harder to dislodge. If it\u2019s the latter, it will largely be rejected and create the space for a fundamentally different approach.For now, though, and at the risk of sounding hopelessly out of step with the times, let me venture a guess. Much of America, including some large number of Republicans waiting to be mobilized, is thirsting for leaders of courage and purpose who, in a fractious and intemperate age, believe \u2014 and can help others believe \u2014 that one of the high callings of politics is to heal our wounds rather than to inflict new ones, to appeal to our best instincts rather than our worst. Or, as Robert Kennedy said, in a line he attributed to the ancient Greeks, to \u201ctame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.\u201dFor many of us, Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Moore represent the politics of dissolution and dehumanization, of resentment and enmity, of half-truths and anti-truths. Republicans who do not want their party to be defined by them need to understand they can\u2019t avoid this fight. They have to decide how they want to wage it and how they are going to win it. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a winning one, but I\u2019m certain it\u2019s an ennobling one. And that should be enough.Any takers?Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, served in the previous three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Davis.We caught up with Dr. Wintemute, 65, by phone on Monday. Some excerpts:Q. What went through your mind when you saw the news out of Las Vegas?How do we stop it?There isn\u2019t an easy answer. These events are all different and if we devise narrowly crafted policies to prevent the last one, we might not affect the next one.There are some commonalities. One is that weapons designed to kill large numbers of people in a small period of time are more readily available than they should be.Does California have the right mix of gun-control laws?Nobody has it right.But I will say California does have more stringent requirements than most states. Our homicide rates are below average. Our suicide rates are well below average. And beginning about 10 years ago, as rates across the country either stabilized or tended to drift up, California\u2019s have been drifting down.How do you explain that?I suspect it\u2019s a lot of things. Some of them have nothing to do with guns. We have a pretty good health care system. We have a pretty good mental health care system. We have more economic equity than a lot of states have.This is a fundamental point: preventing gun violence just by focusing on guns themselves won\u2019t be sufficient.Do shootings of the kind in Las Vegas take up too much oxygen in the gun debate?I have very mixed opinions. On the one hand, yes, they do take up the oxygen. They account for no more than one maybe two percent of all the deaths from firearm violence in the United States.But the flip side is these events, for good or for ill, give people the sense of a personal stake in the issue. That can have effects in opposite directions. I suspect we will see a spike in gun purchasing after this shooting. But one hopes that people\u2019s increasing sense of personal risk will translate into effective action on the problem.We just have to wait and see.This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)News organizations across California published editorials Monday condemning the violence in Las Vegas.A sampling of the commentary:California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Twitter Plans to Open Ad Data to Users", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Twitter said on Tuesday that it would bring more transparency to advertisements on its site, including political ads, in the latest response by a technology company to criticism about its role in spreading foreign propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign.The company said that under its new rules, users would be able to see who had created an ad, how long an ad had been running and how the ad was targeted toward a specific user.Political ads for a candidate or party would carry a special label to make them stand out. Twitter said it would disclose who had paid for the election advertisement and allow users to find information about the buyer, including ad spending history and ad targeting practices.Twitter said it would put some of these changes in place in the coming weeks, starting in the United States and then expanding globally.Lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration about Twitter. In late September, he said Twitter\u2019s response was \u201cinadequate\u201d when it was asked to provide evidence of Russian-linked advertising and accounts that spread misinformation or were used to favor a presidential candidate.At the time, Twitter said it had discovered about 200 accounts linked to Russian efforts to influence the election. But that figure was significantly less than the number uncovered a month earlier by researchers from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the public policy research group in Washington. The researchers tracked 600 Twitter accounts \u2014 both human and suspected automated \u201cbots\u201d \u2014 that they linked to Russian attempts to influence the election.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said that the company\u2019s announcement did not go far enough and that online companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google needed rules that the government could enforce.Last week, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a bill that would require digital platforms to report who bought political ads on their sites in the same way that TV broadcast stations must maintain databases with those disclosures. The bill was a response to concern that fake accounts linked to Russia on Facebook and other sites were able to fly past monitors on the sites and easily buy thousands of ads promoting racial and other hot-button issues to sow chaos before the election and to influence the result.\u201cI welcome this transparency,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, \u201cbut we need a law in place for two major reasons: Not every company will do this, and you need rules for the road.\u201d She added that the companies should not be left to police themselves.The changes also raise new issues for politicians. For one, advertising agencies often consider their digital strategy part of their \u201csecret sauce\u201d when trying to sell their services to politicians and campaign strategists. Shining a light on the types of ads, the amount spent on them and how often they change could give valuable information to competing candidates.It is also unclear whether Twitter will be able to keep up with campaigns\u2019 ever-changing digital targeting, budgets and goals, and the company did not mention how it plans to tackle large-scale misinformation spread by bots.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said transparency in advertising alone \u201cis not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages.\u201dTwitter said it would try to tighten standards for issues-based ads that wouldn\u2019t fall under its new electioneering rules, such as an environmental group\u2019s push for clean-air policies or an energy company\u2019s promotion of environmental deregulation. But the company admitted that the industry had not agreed on definitions for issues ads.\u201cWe will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policymakers and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above,\u201d Twitter said in its blog post.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst there were individual offices. Then cubicles and open floor plans. Now, there is a \u201cpalette of places.\u201dNew office designs are coming to a workplace near you, with layouts meant to cater to the variety of tasks required of modern white-collar workers. Put another way, it means people don\u2019t sit in just one place.It\u2019s partly a backlash against the one-size-fits-all mind-set, not to mention the corporate penny-pinching, embodied in the move toward pure open floor plans that packed more workers into less and less space. That idea was supposed to drive collaboration, but many experts agree it often went too far, with row upon row of desks and workbench-style seating more likely to generate ennui than efficiency.\u201cWhen used as a generic answer for work space design, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d said David Lathrop, a researcher at Steelcase, a big office furniture maker.The new model is largely open, but not entirely. Under the revised thinking, breaking down walls to bring people together is good, but so are \u201cteam spaces\u201d and standing tables, comfortable couches and movable walls.Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn\u2019t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include \u201cisolation rooms,\u201d soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.And it\u2019s meant to be tweaked as needs change. \u201cThis continues to be iterated,\u201d said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM \u2014 and whose use of the word \u201citerated\u201d hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.\u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019re going stop and say, \u2018This is it,\u2019\u201d he said.The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work \u2014 or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce\u2019s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.\u201cThese workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,\u201d said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology \u2014 and its hurry-up ways \u2014 into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called \u201cactivity-based workplace design,\u201d tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.\u201cOffice geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,\u201d said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.\u201cYou have to collaborate more,\u201d said Michael Ford, Microsoft\u2019s general manager of global real estate. \u201cWe absolutely have to change.\u201dFor decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to \u201cdo a turtle,\u201d researchers say, and retrench and communicate less \u2014 colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example.Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. \u201cThat\u2019s the sweet spot for Microsoft,\u201d Mr. Ford said.The company thinks it is working. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company\u2019s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft\u2019s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.But companies can also save money, by using a little less space than conventional offices do.Worker space is now about 150 square feet per person, down from 225 square feet in 2010, estimates Tim Venable, senior vice president for research at CoreNet Global, a commercial real estate association. But the hybrid design saves less than entirely open designs, which usually have workbench settings and in which the amount of space can drop to as low as 60 square feet per worker.\u201cThere can be huge value to people coming together, but the real reason a lot of corporations have gone to bench seating is money falling to the bottom line,\u201d said Mr. Lathrop of Steelcase.Another space saver has been getting people to work from home, a trend for years in corporate America. But that trend is reversing, as companies recognize that offices can be creative clusters.IBM, for example, recently called 5,000 of its at-home employees back to offices, though one in five workers in North America still work from home full time, the company said.Since 2014, IBM has spent $380 million renovating its work spaces in the United States, which now bear all the hallmarks of the new hybrid design \u2014 open spaces, whiteboard walls, no offices, sit-or-stand desks, huddle rooms and phone rooms.IBM, said Mr. Cuevas, vice president for real estate strategy and operations, offers employees up to 10 different space configurations. In January, the company also remade its headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., with senior executives departing wood-paneled offices for smaller, side-by-side glass ones without doors.While G.E. executives wait for the company\u2019s new headquarters to be built in Boston, they are working in temporary offices nearby, designed according to the new principles. The contrast with the cavernous offices and silent hallways of the old headquarters in suburban Connecticut could scarcely be more striking \u2014 open spaces, sit-or-stand desks, and no parking spaces. (Workers are urged to take public transportation.)Face-to-face conversations have replaced endless email chains, so decisions are made faster, said Ann Klee, vice president for the Boston development and operations. Still, openness has its limits. Sometimes, she concedes, you do have to ask colleagues to use their \u201cindoor voices.\u201d More quiet rooms are being added to the new headquarters design.The Boston Consulting Group has also adopted the new design, with two goals in mind: prompt people to come to the office rather than avoid it, and encourage more \u201ccasual collisions\u201d that might spur workers to trade ideas and build relationships.Its old Midtown Manhattan office was a traditional space with offices housing one, two or four people each. \u201cLots of doors, lots of pillars, nowhere to really hang out, and people had lunch delivered to their desks,\u201d said Ross Love, a senior partner in New York.The new space, in the Hudson Yards development on the Far West Side of Manhattan, is a hybrid open design. Since the firm moved in last November, most consultants have been coming into the office substantially more often than they did to the old building.Two tests were conducted of about 100 employees, before and after the move. In the new space, workers spent an additional four to five hours a week in short, unplanned interactions. And they spent less time in formal meetings.In surveys, the company\u2019s workers say they are getting more done, faster in the new space. But the payoff, Mr. Love concedes, is difficult to measure so far.\u201cIt\u2019s like increasing the clock speed of a computer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you rev things up, you ought to be able to do more.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Science and History to Unlock the Secrets of Bread", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "Nathan Myhrvold and Francisco Migoya\u2019s myth-busting new book, \u201cModernist Bread,\u201d is a call for bakers to experiment and innovate.Supported byBELLEVUE, Wash. \u2014 Two years ago in Paris, Nathan Myhrvold wandered the Louvre on a mission, camera in hand, documenting every image of bread that he could find. \u201cSadly, art historians don\u2019t catalog paintings by whether or not there\u2019s bread in them,\u201d he said.The new book \u2014 stretching over 2,000 pages, with step-by-step images and a hefty list price of $625 \u2014 chronicles the history and science of bread-making in depth (\u201cBaking is applied microbiology,\u201d one chapter begins), breaking frequently for meticulous, textbook-style tangents on flour and fermentation. Its recipes require a commitment to close reading, and to flipping back through the books for deeper explanations. But each has useful variations that work with many kinds of mixing and cooking methods, for both professional and home kitchens.Above all, the book is a call for cooks to rethink one of the world\u2019s oldest foods \u2014 to understand how bread is made, using more than their instinct and intuition, so they can push the craft forward.\u201cYou do things one way, until you learn there\u2019s a completely different way that\u2019s even better,\u201d Mr. Migoya said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s always a better way.\u201dThe Cooking Lab\u2019s headquarters are in Bellevue, across Lake Washington from Seattle. Mr. Migoya runs a spotless kitchen on the second floor, equipped with many types of ovens, a freeze dryer, a three-dimensional scanner and an ultrasonic bath.The kitchen has become a base for low-tech investigations, too, like the authors\u2019 re-enactment of a first-century fresco that shows a man handing out bread in Pompeii.To reproduce the squat loaves, they procured a bronze Roman bread stamp from an antiquities dealer in New York (yes, he was horrified when he found out it would be put to use in a working oven) and called in a costume designer to dress a few of their bearded colleagues.What might sound like cute cosplay for bread nerds also sums up the spirit of \u201cModernist Bread,\u201d a book that demands bakers look into the past without romanticizing it.The history of bread has been ugly at times, and the wedge loaves of Pompeii, according to Mr. Migoya and Mr. Myhrvold, weren\u2019t exactly delicious. The book insists that the most exciting time to be a baker (or bread lover) isn\u2019t a golden age that has passed us all by. It wasn\u2019t Pompeii, or medieval Florence or 18th-century France, with its wheat riots. And it wasn\u2019t Northern California in the 1970s, where the American artisanal bread movement started in response to the industrialization of bread.It is right now.So Mr. Myhrvold is puzzled by the uniformity of bakeries and bread aisles, and the persistence of what he calls \u201can ethos of primitivism,\u201d or a resistance to innovation, among so many contemporary bakers.\u201cIt\u2019s led to ever more primitive techniques,\u201d Mr. Myhrvold said, noting the current preference for sourdough over yeast, for wood over gas and for grinding flours in-house. \u201cMy rhetorical question is, \u2018What\u2019s next, stone tools?\u2019\u201d\u201cModernist Bread\u201d finds inspiration in a variety of sources, industrial as well as artisanal, offering a defense of high fructose corn syrup alongside a guide to caring for wild sourdough starters, and debunking the idea that water purity affects the rise and flavor of bread.It offers fresh techniques for solving all sorts of infuriating baking puzzles. To combat the density and dryness of whole wheat bread, Mr. Migoya adds in the bran and germ later, only after the dough has developed significant gluten, to bake a more lightweight, airy loaf.To prevent the inexorable balding process in which bagels shed their toppings, a fine slurry of modified tapioca starch works like a powerful, edible glue, firmly affixing a dense, even layer of toppings to baked bagels. A little gelatin makes high-hydration doughs \u2014 those gloopy, fussy darlings of the bread world \u2014 much easier to handle, with the bonus of a browner crust.Some of the tips are dead simple: To rescue an over-proofed dough, punch it down and reshape it.He had folded in a pur\u00e9e of huitlacoche, the rich, earthy fungus that grows in corn, as well as some fresh yellow kernels. Though he had access to more equipment than most fine-dining restaurants on the planet, Mr. Migoya followed a hands-on method that relied on plenty of visual and tactile cues.\u201cThere\u2019s tech for determining flour strength, hydration, staling, all of these things,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when it comes to how to determine proper proofing, you need a finger. It\u2019s the best instrument there is.\u201dMr. Migoya had mixed the whole wheat dough with Sir Yeast a Lot, one of two four-year-old sourdough starters that are fed daily, so they\u2019re up and ready to work by 10 each morning. Every half-hour, he gave it a quick fold, until he could stretch the dough into a membrane as sheer and ephemeral as a chewing gum bubble.When Mr. Migoya lifted the lid on the wobbly sourdough, to add bran and germ, an ancient smell wafted out: fermented grain, rich with perfume, high and sweet and alcoholic.He was running his own chocolate shop in the Hudson Valley when Mr. Myhrvold, now 58, tapped him to head up the Cooking Lab\u2019s kitchen in 2014.One mystery eluded Mr. Migoya as he worked on the book: understanding the specific, glorious smell of just-baked bread. \u201cSure, there are a lot of compounds transforming during the baking process,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there isn\u2019t a complete answer as to why bread smells so darn good.\u201dHe studied academic papers, and his team did some of their own chemical analyses, trying to distill the essence of the aroma in a rotary evaporator. It wasn\u2019t possible.Neither, Mr. Myhrvold says, is predicting the future of bread. He notes that while culinary movements like nouvelle cuisine have continually shifted restaurant culture, the world of bread has been slower to change.\u201cI\u2019m not quite pompous and narcissistic enough to say, \u2018Here is where bread is going,\u2019\u201d Mr. Myhrvold said. But he hopes the book explodes some misconceptions for bakers.Mr. Migoya thinks that flour may come to be valued, like chocolate and coffee, as a product worth a premium price. \u201cI don\u2019t want bread to be an elite thing that no one can afford,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there should be some breads that are highly regarded for their ingredients, and for the craft of their bakers.\u201dSome professional bakers have wondered how Mr. Myhrvold, who hasn\u2019t been handling fermentations or mixing large amounts of bread daily, for decades, might teach the industry something new. \u201cI was skeptical at first,\u201d said Melissa Weller, formerly the head baker at Per Se in New York, and later Roberta\u2019s in Brooklyn. \u201cBut now I\u2019m curious.\u201dMs. Weller, who worked with a wood-fired oven for years (and found it inefficient for bread), also has a degree in chemical engineering. Like many bakers, she has pieced together a deep knowledge from independent reading \u2014 Nancy Silverton, Jeffrey Hamelman, Michel Suas \u2014 and many years of bread production in different kinds of kitchens.\u201cBread-baking is a hard-earned knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far, I\u2019ve never seen a book that\u2019s able to express it all.\u201dEarly in the book\u2019s genesis, Mr. Migoya worked for months on a bread family tree \u2014 lean, enriched, flat, bricklike \u2014 tracing relationships in ratios and practices across the world, narrowing categories and setting down definitions for words that have often resisted them. \u201cThe history of bread is full of human folly, which is great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of what is beautiful about bread.\u201dWhat excited him now was the idea of someone reading the book and going her own way, of bakeries in New York, Tokyo and Paris with utterly different menus. \u201cMaybe new kinds of bread will come to light, and someone will invent a new type of bread,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be so exciting.\u201dAfter Mr. Migoya baked his huitlacoche sourdough, it had a dark, crackling crust. Sawing it open with a serrated cake knife, he revealed a tender, stretchy core, a gelatinous sheen along its wide, open crumb.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Mr. Migoya said, as if he hadn\u2019t cut into thousands of similarly beautiful loaves.He had been tinkering with a huitlacoche bread for some time. For this version, the one he planned to serve on a publicity tour for the book, Mr. Migoya had charred chiles and slow-cooked a traditional red mole from Puebla, Mexico. He mixed it with butter in a Pacojet, which sent a high-speed blade spinning through, top to bottom, turning it smooth, shiny and just the right temperature to eat.He used a piping bag fitted with a flat tip to squeeze a generous amount of butter down the middle of each slice, sweeping crumbs away, keeping his cutting board pristine. The bread was the deep gray of wet pavement, and the crimped ribbon of mole butter was bright red.It had an intense, satisfying crunch and chew, and an elaborate rush of heat and tang that carried on long after the last bite. It was familiar, but also entirely new.\u201cBread and butter,\u201d Mr. Migoya said. \u201cIt\u2019s only bread and butter.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

Mr. Trump\u2019s other leading antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, was recently confirmed to lead competition cases at the Justice Department.The timing of the official nominations is unclear. They will be reviewed by Congress but are expected to be approved.Under Mr. Simons, who led the competition bureau of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration, the agency is expected take a free-markets and conservative approach to antitrust issues, maintaining decades-long interpretations of competition laws that put consumer welfare and the efficiencies of markets at the center of enforcement actions and merger reviews.Amazon\u2019s $4.3 billion purchase of Whole Foods was quickly approved by the F.T.C. in August, largely because of ample competition in the grocery foods market.But some antitrust academics and politicians criticized the fast review, saying the government needed to look more broadly at whether Amazon\u2019s ability to take losses and leverage other parts of its businesses harmed competition.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, has called on the agency to reopen an antitrust investigation into Google that was closed in 2013, saying new evidence from a parallel investigation in Europe warrants a new look. Stephen K. Bannon, the former senior adviser to Mr. Trump, has called Google a utility-like monopoly that needs antitrust scrutiny.Mr. Simons comes from the Washington offices of the law firm Paul Weiss, where he served as a partner representing big tech clients including Microsoft and Sony in a $4 billion acquisition of patents from Nortel Networks. He also represented Mastercard in antitrust class-action cases against the credit card company in federal court. But like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for corporate watchdog roles, Mr. Simons has been in and out of the private and public sector for years.Since the election, moderate Democrats and Republicans have trained their focus on corporate consolidation. The new climate, antitrust experts say, makes it difficult to predict how Mr. Simons will act.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting so long for leadership at the agencies, we are out of the speculation business until we see some enforcement under the new antitrust chiefs,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.Jeffrey Chester, head of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, a group that has pushed for online privacy regulations and stronger competition enforcement, said the agency was \u201cat a critical turning point about whether it can be relevant at all protecting consumers in the 21st century.\u201d\u201cIt has been unable to effectively address the dramatic loss of privacy Americans face online,\u201d he added. \u201cThe commission has also failed to effectively tackle the growing power of the major internet companies, especially Google and Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lifting the Lid on Braising", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenSome of the most skilled cooks I know \u2014 people who confidently roast, grill and fry \u2014 balk at the notion of braising. They think it\u2019s more mysterious or fussy than other cooking methods. The opposite is true: Braising is extremely flexible, and it follows a formula.There is an art to it. But since a good braise is so utterly, deliciously succulent, learning how is painless.You need only to understand the process. It involves gently simmering vegetables, fish, fowl or meat (or a combination) with a small amount of liquid, usually in a covered pot. Braising chicken is a good place to start, and it\u2019s a lot easier than you think.Indisputably, the best part of the bird for this project is the thigh: It is the most succulent cut. Though a whole chicken chopped in pieces can be braised, skip the heartache of overcooked breast meat and stick to thighs; your fellow diners will thank you.A chicken thigh is nearly impossible to overcook. There is forgiveness \u2014 10 minutes longer in the oven simply means a little more tenderness. Thighs can also be cooked ahead and successfully reheated, often gaining juiciness and depth in the process. I am not, however, referring to skinless, boneless thighs. You want skin-on, bone-in meat. Fat and bone both impart flavor.To braise, you\u2019ll want to season the meat and brown it in a pan, then add onions or other vegetables. Moisten it all with water, tomatoes, broth or wine and bake in a covered dish for an hour. Cook it until the meat gives no resistance when probed with a fork. Uncover the dish and bake another 10 to 15 minutes to give the dish more color and to concentrate the cooking liquid.With this template in mind, you can let your imagination go. Dream up a braised chicken with thyme sprigs, braised chicken with tomatoes and peppers, or braised chicken with wild mushrooms.Lately, I have had my heart set on tangy braised chicken with apricots, lightly perfumed with saffron and very lemony. I imagined some commingling of Persian and North African spices. The craving didn\u2019t go away, nor did I resist it.Using the method above produced a remarkably flavorful braise. Adding a few coriander seeds, fennel seeds and cardamom pods changed the feel. Much more than the sum of its parts, this dish has a complexity that belies its easy preparation.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Europe\u2019s Last Dictatorship Became a Tech Hub", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMinsk JournalOver the past few years, Zyba has turned into an island in the middle of Minsk, the Belarusian capital \u2014 still mostly a sterile, utterly unfashionable city with long lines of dominating Soviet buildings and people hurrying past, seemingly terrified of making any form of contact. On Zyba, a crowd of convivial youngsters migrates from one little bar to another, drinking Jack and Coke, smoking endlessly.Many of those carousing belong to Belarus\u2019s sprouting technology industry \u2014 young, savvy and forward-looking designers, bookish and shy engineers, and many others who aspire to belong. More than 30,000 tech specialists now work in Minsk, a city of about two million, many of them creating mobile apps that are used by more than a billion people in 193 countries, according to the local government.One of the Minsk techies is Dmitri Kovalyov, 35, an artist who a couple of years ago worked for MSQRD, a smartphone tool that lets people superimpose various masks over their faces in selfie videos.In 2016, Mr. Kovalyov couldn\u2019t imagine that his respect for Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s acting and environmental activism would get the company very far. But before that year\u2019s Academy Awards, Mr. Kovalyov and his colleagues developed a tool for a mask that made people in video messages look like Mr. DiCaprio holding two Oscar statuettes.Ten days after the awards, Facebook bought the company for an undisclosed sum. The founders, whose average age was about 25 at the time, moved to London and the United States. Together with some of those co-workers, Mr. Kovalyov is developing a new Minsk start-up, AR Squad, which creates augmented reality content.One of the first masks the other company developed was one resembling Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Belarus\u2019s president, who has ruled for more than two decades. He is prone to publicity stunts like picking potatoes at his estate or taking his teenage son, Nikolai, commonly referred to as Kolya, to sit at international meetings in a military uniform.Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s mask featured his trademark comb-over hair and bushy mustache, but was not considered offensive. On the contrary, Mr. Lukashenko began to believe that the tech industry could become a magic wand to help him end the country\u2019s chronic dependency on Russia.\u201cCreation of an IT state is our ambitious but reachable goal,\u201d Mr. Lukashenko said at a gathering of lawmakers and bureaucrats this summer. \u201cThis will allow us to make Belarus even more modern and prosperous and will let Belarussians look into the future with confidence.\u201dMr. Lukashenko, who once called the internet \u201ca pile of garbage,\u201d began to utter improbable words for a former manager of a collective farm \u2014 about the need to develop artificial intelligence, driverless cars and blockchain technology, which allows multiple parties to keep shared digital records.His government has taken several steps to encourage the tech industry\u2019s development, like granting visa-free entry to citizens of 79 countries, including all Western states, when entering through the Minsk airport. Mr. Lukashenko also wants to lift restrictions on currency transfers to encourage venture financing for start-ups.Belarus produces top-level technical talent, an inheritance from its Soviet past, said Arkady M. Dobkin, who immigrated to the United States in the 1990s and established a software company there.EPAM\u2019s headquarters is in Newtown, Pa., but its main development hub is in Minsk, where more than 6,000 of its technology specialists work.\u201cI think it was the absence of oil that made Belarus do this,\u201d said Mr. Dobkin, 57. \u201cHere, universities produce more highly qualified specialists than the internal market needs.\u201dSergei Chaly, an outspoken economist and former government official, calls Belarus \u201ca dying country with bitcoins.\u201dYevgeny Lipkovich, a popular blogger who made a career out of ridiculing Belarusian bureaucrats, said the only reason the tech industry had found some success in Belarus is that the government \u201ccannot seize people\u2019s brains.\u201d He joked, \u201cIf they want to capture an IT company, what would they get, computers?\u201dPolitics doesn\u2019t seem a big concern for many in the tech crowd, even if young political activists use group chats on the call and messaging app Viber \u2014 an Israeli company whose development hub is in Minsk \u2014 to coordinate activities and plan rallies.Tanks have an important cultural meaning for Belarus and other former Soviet states, where almost every family has an ancestor who fought in one.\u201cHe plays tanks, but this is controlled,\u201d Mr. Lukashenko said of his son at a televised meeting with schoolteachers.\u201cOne hour for tanks, 1.5 hours for music,\u201d the president added, explaining how he controls his son\u2019s time spent on the game. \u201cTwo hours for tanks \u2014 four hours for music.\u201d\u201cFour hours is difficult,\u201d Mr. Lukashenko said, \u201cso he doesn\u2019t play for longer than one hour.\u201dThe Minsk Journal article on Friday about the sprouting technology industry in Belarus misstated the given name of a popular blogger who made a career out of ridiculing Belarusian bureaucrats.

It was the second Dudamel-led tour to be halted since the conductor criticized the government this summer amid a growing political crisis. The cancellation was announced on Thursday, a week before the tour was set to begin.\u201cThis is a very sad, painful moment for me, for the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela, and for my country,\u201d Mr. Dudamel wrote Thursday on Facebook. \u201cWe have once again been prevented in our wish to share the remarkable talent and hope of our people with the world.\u201d1/4 My heart is broken by yet another cancellation by the Venezuelan government of a tour by an El Sistema orchestra.The Bol\u00edvar orchestra began as a youth ensemble and is made up of musicians who, like Mr. Dudamel, were trained by El Sistema, Venezuela\u2019s expansive music education program. The ensemble opened Carnegie Hall\u2019s season last year, toured Europe last spring, and was to play the full Beethoven cycle at concerts in Taipei, Taiwan; Guangzhou, China; and Hong Kong on the Asian tour.Last month the Venezuelan government canceled Mr. Dudamel\u2019s tour of the United States with the National Youth Orchestra of Venezuela.Mr. Dudamel, who is the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and is one of the most sought-after conductors in the world, has long tried to stay above the fray of politics in his native country \u2014 sometimes drawing criticism and protests for his silence.President Maduro mocked Mr. Dudamel in a televised appearance over the summer. \u201cWelcome to politics, Gustavo Dudamel,\u201d he said. \u201cBut act with ethics, and don\u2019t let yourself be deceived into attacking the architects of this beautiful movement of young boys and girls.\u201dMr. Dudamel, in his statement Thursday, called on the players in the orchestra and the young people of Venezuela to \u201cremain strong and proud.\u201d He added, \u201cour spirit will not be broken, our hope will not waver, our music will not be silenced.\u201d\u201cI shall never stop defending freedom of expression and the values of a just society,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDark days like these are difficult, but standing together, we can rise to the challenge of improving our society.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transgender Inmate Accuses Suffolk County of Unfair Medical Treatment", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2012, after falling prey to drug use and depression, an Iraq war veteran named Jessica Sunderland was arrested in connection with a string of burglaries on Long Island and found herself locked up in the Suffolk County jail.In her stay of 16 months, she experienced more than the usual ordeals. Formerly known as Jeremy, Ms. Sunderland was in the middle of transitioning to female and claimed her jailers had denied her the hormone treatment that she had been getting under doctors\u2019 orders for the preceding two years.Even though she filed two grievances with jail officials and asked a local judge to put her back on hormones, she said that did not happen until after she left Suffolk County in 2014 for the upstate prison where she served her sentence. Before leaving, she sued the county in a slow-moving case that will soon have its first major review by a federal judge. In pursuing litigation, Ms. Sunderland, 31, has joined a growing list of transgender inmates who have used the courts to challenge what they have called an unfair lack of medical treatment in the nation\u2019s prisons and jails.While courts have held for decades that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d gives inmates the constitutional right to necessary medical care, some facilities have been slow to extend that safeguard to prisoners who are transitioning. As gender dysphoria \u2014 a disconnect between one\u2019s gender identity and one\u2019s sex at birth \u2014 has increasingly been recognized as a medical condition, a body of case law has emerged in recent years requiring jailers to provide treatment to transgender inmates, just as they would those with heart disease or cancer.\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing problem,\u201d said Richard Saenz, a Lamba Legal lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s a legal issue we get requests for assistance on from all over the country.\u201dMr. Saenz added that corrections officials in Florida and Missouri are also being sued by transgender inmates who are challenging what are known as \u201cfreeze frame\u201d policies, which fix prisoners\u2019 medical care at the level at which they were receiving it when they first came into custody.Ms. Sunderland\u2019s suit began in August 2013, when she submitted a handwritten complaint \u2014 without the assistance of a lawyer \u2014 to the Federal District Court in Central Islip, N.Y. \u201cI am an inmate at the Suffolk County Correctional Facility,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand have been ignored and denied hormone treatment.\u201dTwo years later, after she was sent to serve her sentence at Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, N.Y. (where she did receive treatment), she got a lawyer, David B. Shanies, who filed a new complaint accusing doctors at the Suffolk County jail of violating their own policy by denying his client treatment even though she had a hormone prescription from a veterans\u2019 hospital in Manhattan. The suit filed by Mr. Shanies also claimed that county officials were responsible for Ms. Sunderland\u2019s lack of care.In a motion to dismiss the case, a lawyer for the county said last month that Ms. Sunderland had undergone surgery to remove a liver tumor four months before entering the jail and that doctors there had determined that her hormone treatment could be dangerous. That her own physicians disagreed, the motion said, did not mean that members of the jail\u2019s medical staff were \u201cunconstitutionally indifferent\u201d to her needs.The motion also argued that the county doctors \u2014 including Vincent Geraci, the medical director of the jail \u2014 were, as public employees, immune from being sued. It added that medical and legal opinions about gender dysphoria had changed significantly in recent years: Even if Dr. Geraci and his staff had stopped Ms. Sunderland\u2019s treatment in 2012, that would not \u201crise to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201dBut as the case went into litigation, Mr. Shanies began to study Dr. Geraci\u2019s Facebook page and discovered several instances in which he had liked what court papers filed last week described as \u201canti-transgender and anti-L.G.B.T. messages.\u201d One of them was a photo posted by a user named Trump Wall depicting a bathroom sign with a caption reading, \u201cMen DO NOT belong in the bathrooms with girls!\u201d Another was an article posted by the conservative commentator Allen West about a movement to boycott Target for its transgender-friendly bathroom policy. In the comment section, Mr. West had written, \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re not the only ones who have a problem with liberals pushing their transgender bathroom agenda.\u201dAt a deposition in April, Mr. Shanies asked Dr. Geraci about his activity on Facebook. According to a transcript, Dr. Geraci testified that he rarely spent much time looking at the articles or photographs in question and accused Mr. Shanies of trying to define him \u201cbased on the click of a button.\u201d When Mr. Shanies asked if he did in fact think that \u201cliberals are pushing their transgender bathroom agenda,\u201d the doctor answered no.At some point in the next few months, United States District Judge Joseph F. Bianco will rule on the county\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit, deciding if Ms. Sunderland\u2019s case can move toward trial or settlement. She is seeking damages of at least $1 million.In an interview last week, Ms. Sunderland, who was released from prison in December, said that transitioning was hard enough, but to have done so in jail and without her hormone treatment was practically impossible.\u201cIt was like trying to climb Mount Everest,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get halfway to the top and someone tries to pull you back down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dosa Lesson From a Professional", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteThe crisp lentil and rice crepe, thin as newsprint but far more delicious, was stuffed with a pumpkinseed chutney and saut\u00e9ed greens. It was a little sweet from coconut, fragrant with curry leaves and mustard seeds, and gently sour from the fermented batter.It probably would have remained in the category of restaurant-food-best-left-to-professionals, had the restaurant owner, Anita Jaisinghani, not offered me the recipe when I couldn\u2019t stop effusing about the dish.Making dosas at home is not hard, but there is a learning curve.The batter required a trip to an Indian grocery for ingredients, then 24 hours to soak, grind and ferment. But it was easier than making bread dough since I didn\u2019t have to knead.After my batter puffed up into a glorious pale froth, I pulled out my favorite nonstick pan and started frying.Kitchen wisdom says that, when it comes to frying crepes, the first few should be fed to the dog.In the case of my dosas, it took about a dozen tries to get anything resembling a smooth crepe. The rest clumped or ripped or simply sloshed off the pan. I\u2019ll admit that, having no hungry dog at my ankles, my husband and I ate them ourselves. Ugly and floppy, they were still extremely tasty \u2014 especially topped with the pumpkinseed chutney, which would probably even make newsprint taste good.A week later, while my second batch of dosa batter was fermenting, I went back to Pondicheri for a frying tutorial.One counterintuitive trick, Ms. Jaisinghani said, is not to use too much oil, which encourages the batter to slide around the pan instead of setting.Also, when she poured the runny batter onto the griddle, she let it set for a heartbeat before spreading it with the bottom of a measuring cup.Taking that extra beat before spreading was what really helped improve my dosa technique at home. My next batch all looked like crepes, turning golden and crisp on the bottom while the tops stayed nicely pale.They still weren\u2019t paper thin. But, as Ms. Jaisinghani pointed out, thicker dosas allow you to fully appreciate the flavors of lentil, rice and fermentation. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that thicker is also easier for a novice dosa cook like me.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Invented \u2018Zero\u2019?", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionObviously, there were no intellectual property rights in force back then. Had there been a patent office, it might have ruled, as courts do now, that mathematical advances uncover pre-existing knowledge rather than create anything new \u2014 and are hence unpatentable. The conundrum of whether mathematics is discovered or invented is as old as Plato. Certainly, zero displays this duality: The void is as old as time, but it was a human innovation to harness it with a symbol.In recognition of this innovation, and ignoring all practicalities, suppose someone, somehow, had figured out how to put a price tag on zero. The royalties generated would be staggering \u2014 imagine the tab for just your personal use alone! This might lead to a significant redistribution of wealth, most of it going to the developing world.Babylon ended up with 18 percent, which if allotted to Iraq, the present-day country of its location, might be just compensation for the years of war endured. Greece came next, with a surprising 15 percent \u2014 perhaps my class felt the country was getting shortchanged for all its other mathematical contributions. The Mayans raked in 14 percent, which means Mexico would be rolling in so much money from its share that it might be the one clamoring (and paying) for a wall. My class\u2019s most left-leaning group declared it wouldn\u2019t disburse the money at all, \u201cso as not to encourage capitalism.\u201dOf course, the exercise was pure fantasy for many reasons; any compensatory scheme would be dead on arrival based on the mention of \u201creparations.\u201d And yet it highlighted the fact that there were cultures and peoples that parented zero, whose descendants may not be doing as well now. If not financial recompense, is at least some enhanced ethical responsibility toward them owed?If so, the primary onus might fall on tech companies, arguably the biggest users of this resource. Right now, their prize target is India, with Microsoft, Google and Facebook all vying to bring its enormous population online. These giants might point out that they\u2019re already being altruistic by offering free connectivity, through schemes that will plug in rural areas, vitalize the economy and transform the country \u2014 and just happen to add hundreds of millions of potential customers to their rosters for a variety of ads and e-products. Could it be a coincidence that Microsoft, for instance, has also been investing heavily in future cloud services, cybersecurity and e-commerce for India?Think of it. The companies will use the indigenously developed resource of zeros and ones (the Arabs got their numerals from India, after all), package them into new services and products, and sell them back. India has lived through such irony before. The British Empire took her raw cotton and sold it back as finished garments, destroying the local textile industry and helping lower India\u2019s share of the world gross domestic product to 3 percent from 23 percent.Fortunately, the parallel flounders. The finished e-products will mostly be manufactured in India, even if backed by foreign investment. Also, the country is wiser: It will not succumb easily to a new cyber-colonialism. Last year, under a broader \u201cnet neutrality\u201d decision, the government banned Facebook\u2019s \u201cFree Basics\u201d plan, which offered free Wi-Fi but only to websites of the company\u2019s choosing (Facebook, undeterred, is already marketing a replacement). This year, it also declined a bid from Microsoft to offer connectivity through old television bands. Instead, under pressure from Indian cellular operators, the bands will be auctioned off.Whether Indian tech companies will prevail remains to be seen. What\u2019s clear is that vigorous market competition is underway to control all those zeros and ones. Despite my liberal student group\u2019s disapproval, zero encourages capitalistic forces, after all.In fact, zero is essential to much of human endeavor; it has become a fundamental part of our legacy, too seemingly immutable for any kind of compensatory reckoning. And yet the Bakhshali manuscript reminds us that zero wasn\u2019t always at hand. Rather, it was the intellectual product of cultures perhaps far different from our own, of peoples and regions that may have subsided but could once again rise to dominance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reading This While Walking? In Honolulu, It Could Cost You", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou see them everywhere: people walking with their eyes glued to their mobile phone screens on busy streets. But walking and texting can be dangerous \u2014 and cities in the United States and Europe have begun to do something about it.\u201cThis is really milestone legislation that sets the bar high for safety,\u201d said Brandon Elefante, the City Council member who proposed the bill. Pedestrians, he said, will share the responsibility for their safety with motorists.\u201cA lot of people do it; they know it\u2019s risky and do it anyway. They convince themselves that \u2018this text is important,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we need to be aware of.\u201dPeople who text and walk, for example, are nearly four times as likely to engage in at least one dangerous action, like jaywalking or not looking both ways, and take 18 percent more time to cross a street than undistracted pedestrians. Solutions, Dr. Krug said, are \u201chard to legislate and even harder to enforce.\u201dA number of other cities have come up with creative ways to help protect so-called cellphone zombies, who talk, text, listen to music, check their email and even snap selfies. Initiatives include low-tech efforts, like edgy signs in Hayward, Calif. (\u201cHeads Up! Cross the Street. Then Update Facebook.\u201d) and no-selfie zones in Mumbai, and specially designed traffic lights in Europe and several pieces of legislation in reaction to Honolulu\u2019s new law.Last month, the Board of Supervisors in San Mateo County, Calif., unanimously passed a resolution prohibiting pedestrians\u2019 use of cellphones while crossing streets. It\u2019s not enforceable, as state law governs such issues, but David Canepa, who introduced the measure, said it was an important springboard; the resolution is expected to go to the California Legislature for statewide consideration in January.\u201cThere is chaos in the crosswalks,\u201d said Mr. Canepa, who admits to a few close calls with distracted driving and walking himself. \u201cI know it\u2019s an issue. I\u2019ve lived it. My cellphone is my life.\u201dAs children, he said, we are taught to look both ways when crossing a street, but \u201cyou can\u2019t look both ways when you\u2019re looking down and texting.\u201dCritics are concerned about personal freedom and slow to adjust to new ideas, Mr. Canepa said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, people understand the value of public safety,\u201d he added. \u201cThis legislation is practical and is common sense. It will save lives.\u201dMunicipal laws are not tracked, but Rexburg, Idaho, may have been among the first to adopt a citywide ban, in 2011. The city recorded five pedestrian deaths in a short period in a concentrated area. It was a high toll, given the city\u2019s size: about 35,000 residents.\u201cIt was a shock to our system,\u201d said Stephen Zollinger, Rexburg\u2019s city attorney.Distracted walking was suspected. Along with other safety measures, Rexburg barred pedestrians from using hand-held devices \u2014 except while talking \u2014 while crossing public streets, he said, and \u201cwe\u2019ve not had a pedestrian fatality since.\u201dBodegraven, a small town near Amsterdam, tried a different approach. This year, it embedded LED-illuminated strips in the crosswalk at a busy intersection \u2014 right in the line of sight of people staring at their phones. When the traffic lights turn red or green, so do the lights at ground level, alerting pedestrians when it\u2019s safe to cross.The pilot program aims to anticipate trends, not reverse them, said Dolf Roodenburg, the project leader and a traffic engineer in the Netherlands. If it\u2019s successful, the town hopes to install the lights at more intersections and on bike paths, and offer them to other cities.In Augsburg, Germany, similar lights were installed last year after a teenager using her smartphone was struck and seriously injured by a tram when she walked onto the tracks.There are, of course, contrary points of view on the effectiveness of legislating pedestrian behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s an easy way out. Engineering is a lot more difficult, but a lot more efficient,\u201d Ms. Sadik-Khan said. \u201cTraffic safety is very serious business in government, based in sound analysis.\u201dShe and others recommended focusing on proven strategies like vehicle speed reduction, which is one of the most effective ways to reduce deaths, as survival rates are higher in low-speed collisions.For example, they may fail to stop at intersections or red lights, Ms. Sobel said. In many low- and middle-income countries, where about 90 percent of the world\u2019s road-traffic deaths occur, according to the W.H.O., pedestrians often share poorly maintained roads with animals, carts, cars, buses and trucks. Those roads are already high-risk environments not designed for walking, Ms. Sobel said.Ms. Hersman, who previously served as chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said concerns about government overreach often lessened with time. Laws requiring seatbelt use or restricting smoking initially met resistance but now are widely accepted.\u201cIt\u2019s important to have an open mind,\u201d she said. \u201cSociety can move forward.\u201dMr. Massey of Synaxis said it would take some convincing for people to see value in laws to combat distracted walking.\u201cI agree in principle \u2014 begrudgingly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit Big Brotherish. We don\u2019t like that in this country.\u201dEuropean efforts are more realistic, Mr. Massey added. \u201cI think the lights are brilliant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reflects an understanding of human nature: People are going to do it anyway, so let\u2019s make it safer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Monday a Senate aide identified the professor as Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor of international relations. Mr. Papadopoulos met in London with Mr. Mifsud and a Russian woman whom Mr. Papadopoulos described as a relative of Mr. Putin. Mr. Papadopoulos later learned, the court documents say, that the woman was not related to Putin. Mr. Trump met in Washington with his foreign policy advisers, including Mr. Papadopoulos, who told the group that he had connections to help arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Others at the meeting noted that Russia was under sanctions. Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general but then a senator from Alabama and a top Trump campaign adviser, quickly shut down the subject and said it should not be discussed again, a former campaign official said.Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos by email to a contact who claimed connections to the Russian foreign ministry.

The Brooklyn-born chef moved to the city in 2003, after having visited only once for the Kentucky Derby. Since then, the city has given him his wife, a circle of friends and a unique culinary voice that brought TV gigs and corporate sponsorships.So it was only natural that Mr. Lee, 45, was worried about leaving Louisville. (For a long time, he told interviewers that he was splitting his time between the two cities.) But after nearly 15 years, he had maxed out.But Mr. Lee saw something else, something more intangible and essential, in Washington. It is a city, like Louisville, that looks North but still has one foot planted firmly in the South. (Washington and Louisville are, in fact, at approximately the same latitude.) As such, it lacks a rigidly defined food culture.\u201cI\u2019ve realized I don\u2019t belong anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t belong in the South. But I don\u2019t belong in Brooklyn or Korea, either. So I like cities that have a slight identity crisis because I feel very comfortable there.\u201dOn the menu are some hits from the first Succotash: gargantuan portions of fried chicken and slabs of pork ribs served on plates designed to look like Grandma\u2019s china.

(\u201cWe had to call three different purveyors because no one we knew carried it,\u201d Mr. Lee said, \u201cbut that was what it needed.\u201d)There is also an emphasis on seafood, which he didn\u2019t use often in landlocked Louisville. Succotash\u2019s opening menu, for example, offers Chesapeake catfish (\u201cthe best I\u2019ve ever tasted\u201d) because the salty bay adds a clean, bright flavor often lacking in freshwater bottom feeders.He put XO sauce on a Southern menu, Mr. Lee said, because part of what he wants to do is mess with diners\u2019 norms. \u201cI feel like if I did that in Birmingham, Ala., I might get sent packing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I do that in D.C., I don\u2019t think people care.

Gail said in a statement emailed on Tuesday.The video shows Officer Amiott punching Mr. Hubbard in the head and face more than a dozen times, even when Mr. Hubbard is prone on the ground. It was taken by a bystander and posted on Facebook, and the police department also released a version.Ms. Gail said in her statement that Mr. Amiott, 31, had been suspended for \u201crule violations\u201d since then but that her office had continued to receive complaints of other episodes of professional misconduct.\u201cAfter a review, I found Amiott to have violated additional departmental rules, including Conduct Unbecoming and Courtesy, calling into serious question his suitability as a Euclid Police Officer,\u201d the mayor said in her statement.A staff member at her office said by telephone that the mayor would have no further comment. Calls to telephone numbers listed under Mr. Amiott\u2019s name were not answered, and a spokesman for the police department did not reply to an email and voice mail messages.He was cited for pistol-whipping a driver with a handgun, mishandling evidence, losing his temper in front of his commanding officer and being involved in two crashes in police vehicles, The A.P. reported.On Tuesday, Christopher McNeal, a lawyer for Mr. Hubbard, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Hubbard, 25, a welder, had been treated at a hospital for \u201cbodily injuries\u201d and released. He had pleaded not guilty to misdemeanors, including resisting arrest and driving with a suspended license.His girlfriend, Yolimar Tirado, was also arrested during the traffic stop and was charged with misdemeanors, Mr. McNeal said.Mr. McNeal has filed a motion to dismiss those charges.\u201cIn its broader context, there are some serious questions regarding the patterns, the practices and the customs of the Euclid Police Department using excessive force against its citizens, especially the African-American citizens,\u201d Mr. McNeal said.The arrest of Mr. Hubbard set off protests in Euclid, a city of about 48,000, and calls for a thorough response by the authorities.

Many of these solutions have now reached the famous inflection point where the adoption starts to accelerate.\u201dAlphabet\u2019s self-driving unit, Waymo, has been fighting in courts for months to get access to a due diligence report that Uber commissioned before it bought Ottomotto, the autonomous truck start-up founded by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski.That report, compiled by the cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg, was made public on Monday. Waymo is using it to show that Uber was aware of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s attempts to retain and gain access to information taken from Google. It details a history of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s meeting with Uber executives while still employed at Google.According to the document, Stroz found 50,000 work emails from his time at Google on Levandowski\u2019s personal computer. Stroz also found texts between Levandowski and former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick about recruitment efforts and working with Uber\u2019s self-driving arm dating back to as early as February and March 2016 \u2014 just weeks after Levandowski left Alphabet and launched Otto out of stealth.After leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski said he found a data storage container in his house containing \u201csource code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars,\u201d according to the report, information that Mr. Levandowski said he downloaded as a matter of \u201chis departure from ordinary course of business.\u201dInvestigators also found evidence of photos of Google self-driving car designs, whiteboard sketches and pictures of hardware and electronic components stored on Mr. Levandowski\u2019s iPhone.Jo Bertram, the regional manager for Uber in Northern Europe, has announced her departure just as the new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is in London to meet with the city\u2019s transportation authorities over their decision not to renew Uber\u2019s license.Given some of our current challenges, I\u2019m also convinced that now is the right time to have a change of face, and to hand over to someone who will be here for the long haul and take us into the next phase.

Although banks have looked at using blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, they have been wary of wading directly into the market.Goldman\u2019s effort involves both its currency-trading division and the bank\u2019s strategic investment group, the people said. That suggests the firm believes bitcoin\u2019s future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold.Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood executive and co-founder of DreamWorks Animation, is trying to raise money for a television start-up and he\u2019s doing it on a scale that dwarfs the kind of money raised by the likes of Facebook, Netflix and Uber.Virtually every large media and technology company, as well as several private equity firms, have shown some interest.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s idea?

{"Headline": "Across Myanmar, Denial of Ethnic Cleansing and Loathing of Rohingya", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySITTWE, Myanmar \u2014 The Buddhist abbot tucked his legs under his robes and began to explain.Rohingya Muslims do not belong in Myanmar, and they never have, he said. Their fertility allowed them to overwhelm the local Buddhist population. But now, somehow, many Rohingya seemed to be gone.\u201cWe thank the Lord Buddha for this,\u201d said U Thu Min Gala, the 57-year-old abbot of the Damarama Monastery in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State in western Myanmar. \u201cThey stole our land, our food and our water. We will never accept them back.\u201dBut in Myanmar, and even in Rakhine itself, there is stark denial that any ethnic cleansing is taking place.The divergence between how Myanmar and much of the outside world see the Rohingya is not limited to one segment of local society. Nor can hatred in Myanmar of the largely stateless Muslim group be dismissed as a fringe attitude.Social media postings have amplified the message, claiming that international aid workers are openly siding with the Rohingya. Accordingly, the Myanmar government has blocked aid agencies\u2019 access to Rohingya still trapped in Myanmar \u2014 about 120,000 confined to camps in central Rakhine and tens of thousands more in desperate conditions in the north.The official answer to United Nations accounts of the military\u2019s mass burning of villages and targeting of civilians has been to insist that the Rohingya have been doing it to themselves.\u201cThere is no case of the military killing Muslim civilians,\u201d said Dr. Win Myat Aye, the country\u2019s social welfare minister and the governing National League for Democracy party\u2019s point person on Rakhine. \u201cMuslim people killed their own Muslim people.\u201dWhen asked in an interview about the evidence against the military, the minister noted that the Myanmar government had not sent any investigators to Bangladesh to vet the testimony of fleeing Rohingya, but that he would raise the possibility of doing so in a future meeting.\u201cThank you for advising us on this idea,\u201d he said.The Rohingya, who speak a Bengali dialect and tend to look distinct from most of Myanmar\u2019s other ethnic groups, have had roots in Rakhine for generations. Communal tensions between the Rohingya and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists exploded in World War II, when the Rakhine aligned themselves with the Japanese, while the Rohingya chose the British.Although many Rohingya were considered citizens when Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent in 1948, the military junta that wrested power in 1962 began stripping them of their rights. After a restrictive citizenship law was introduced in 1982, most Rohingya became stateless.Even the name Rohingya, which the ethnic group has identified with more vocally in recent years, has been taken from them. The Myanmar government usually refers to the Rohingya as Bengalis, implying they belong in Bangladesh. The public tends to call them an epithet used for all Muslims in Myanmar: kalar.The nomenclature is so sensitive that in a speech this month, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and de facto leader of the government, referred only to \u201cthose who have crossed over to Bangladesh.\u201dSome ethnic Rakhine politicians are hailing the Rohingya exodus as a good thing.\u201cAll the Bengalis learn in their religious schools is to brutally kill and attack,\u201d said Daw Khin Saw Wai, a Rakhine member of Parliament from Rathedaung Township. \u201cIt is impossible to live together in the future.\u201dBuddhist monks, moral arbiters in a pious land, have been at the forefront of a campaign to dehumanize the Rohingya. In popular videos, extremist monks refer to the Rohingya as \u201csnakes\u201d or \u201cworse than dogs.\u201dOutside Mr. Thu Min Gala\u2019s monastery in Sittwe, a pair of signs reflected an alternate sense of reality. One said that the monastery, which is sheltering ethnic Rakhine who fled the conflict zone, would not accept any donations from international agencies. The other warned that multifaith groups were not welcome.The abbot claimed that the authorities in Rakhine had stopped a car owned by the International Committee of the Red Cross that was filled with weaponry destined for Rohingya militants who carried out attacks against the security forces in August. Mr. Thu Min Gala claimed that sticks of dynamite had been wrapped in paper with the Red Cross logo. The Red Cross denied these accusations.\u201cWe don\u2019t trust the international society,\u201d the abbot said. \u201cThey are only on the side of the terrorists.\u201dAt another monastery in Sittwe, an elderly abbot, U Baddanta Thaw Ma, halted my conversation with a young monk by slapping the air in front of my face. \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d he yelled in English, before switching to the local Rakhine dialect. \u201cGo away, you foreigner! Go away, you kalar lover.\u201dPublic sentiment against Muslims \u2014 who are about 4 percent of Myanmar\u2019s population, encompassing several ethnic groups, including the Rohingya \u2014 has spread beyond Rakhine. In 2015 elections, no major political party fielded a Muslim candidate. Today no Muslims serve in Parliament, the first time since the country\u2019s independence.A couple of hours outside Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, U Aye Swe, an administrator for Sin Ma Kaw village, said he was proud to oversee one of Myanmar\u2019s \u201cMuslim-free\u201d villages, which bar Muslims from spending the night, among other restrictions.\u201cKalar are not welcome here because they are violent and they multiply like crazy, with so many wives and children,\u201d he said.Mr. Aye Swe admitted he had never met a Muslim before, adding, \u201cI have to thank Facebook because it is giving me the true information in Myanmar.\u201dSocial media messaging has driven much of the rage in Myanmar. Though widespread access to cellphones only started a few years ago, mobile penetration is now about 90 percent. For many people, Facebook is their only source of news, and they have little experience in sifting fake news from credible reporting.One widely shared message on Facebook, from a spokesman for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s office, emphasized that biscuits from the World Food Program, a United Nations agency, had been found at a Rohingya militant training camp. The United Nations called the post \u201cirresponsible.\u201dThe Myanmar government, however, insists the public needs to be guided.\u201cWe do something that we call educating the people,\u201d said U Pe Myint, the nation\u2019s information minister. He acknowledged, \u201cIt looks rather like indoctrination, like in an authoritarian or totalitarian state.\u201dIn Yangon, Mr. Pe Myint this month gathered local journalists to discuss what he called \u201cfabricated news\u201d by foreign reporters and a \u201cpolitical war\u201d in which international aid groups favored the Rohingya.Last month, a mob in Sittwe attacked Red Cross workers, who were loading a boat with supplies that locals believed would only go to the Rohingya.Even among officials who might otherwise champion human rights, frustration has been directed at foreign critics. Quietly, some defend Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s failure to call out the military and protect the Rohingya by saying it would be political suicide in a country where hatred of the Rohingya is so widespread. They see the recent international pressure, at best, as ignorant of domestic complexities and, at worst, as intent on hindering Myanmar\u2019s development.\u201cWe ask the international community to acknowledge that these Muslims are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and that this crisis is an infringement of our sovereignty,\u201d said U Nyan Win, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy, which shares power with Myanmar\u2019s military. \u201cThis is the most important thing with the Rakhine issue.\u201dU Ko Ko Gyi, a democracy advocate who was jailed for 17 years by the military when it ruled Myanmar, also evoked national interest.\u201cWe have been human-rights defenders for many years and suffered for a long time but we are standing together on this issue because we need to support our national security,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are a small country that lies between India and China, and the DNA of our ancestors is to try to struggle for our survival,\u201d Mr. Ko Ko Gyi said. \u201cIf you in the West criticize us too much, then you will push us into the arms of China and Russia.\u201dLast month, those two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council shielded Myanmar from an attempt by other nations to condemn the Myanmar military for its offensive in Rakhine.The humanitarian situation has grown desperate within Rakhine while the official block on aid largely continues.Throughout the state, ethnic Rakhine have been warned by community leaders not to break the blockade. Last month in Myebon Township, in central Rakhine, women\u2019s activists prevented international aid groups from delivering assistance to an internment camp where thousands of Rohingya have been sequestered since the 2012 sectarian violence, according to foreign staff.But U Tun Tin, a Rakhine trishaw driver, needed the money and delivered food to the Rohingya camp. Shortly after, his wife, Daw Soe Chay, said she was accosted by a crowd that forced her to a nearby monastery.Inside the religious compound, they beat her and sheared her hair. Then the mob marched her through Myebon, wearing a sign calling her a \u201cnational traitor.\u201dDespite his wife\u2019s ordeal, Mr. Tun Tin said he did not regret having sent supplies to the camp, where Rohingya say their rations are running low.\u201cThey are human,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to eat, just like us.\u201dSaw Nang contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Works to Keep Palestinians\u2019 Talks on Track to Aid Peace", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 With Egypt brokering a reconciliation between the two rival Palestinian factions, President Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East visited Cairo on Thursday to help move those talks along while trying to ensure that the Egyptians do not take them in a direction unacceptable to the United States and Israel.The Oct. 12 agreement calls for the Palestinian Authority to lift sanctions that it imposed on Gaza this year to pressure Hamas by cutting electricity supplies to a few hours a day and slashing payment of government salaries. Hamas, in turn, is to give the authority control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, opening up a critical lifeline for imports and for outside travel.But the pact was really an agreement to start talking: The more troublesome issues between Hamas and Mr. Abbas\u2019s Fatah faction \u2014 including the merger of two separate work forces in Gaza, and what is to become of the estimated 25,000 Hamas fighters, their arsenal of rockets and network of tunnels \u2014 were left for later.A key question is whether the talks in Cairo will give Hamas, which the United States designates as a terrorist organization, influence over a consolidated Palestinian government of both the West Bank and Gaza Strip \u2014 and how much.The United States envoy, Jason D. Greenblatt, warned before his one-day trip to Cairo that any Palestinian government \u201cmust unambiguously and explicitly commit\u201d to nonviolence, peaceful negotiations, recognition of the State of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations \u2014 including those that would disarm terrorists.\u201cIf Hamas is to play any role in a Palestinian government, it must accept these basic requirements,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said.Israel and the United States would both welcome Mr. Abbas\u2019s regaining control of Gaza, if only to avert what aid groups and the United Nations had called an emerging humanitarian and health crisis, as disease spread and the pumping of raw sewage into the Mediterranean began to disrupt water plants along Israel\u2019s own coast.For Egypt, the motivation for brokering the talks goes well beyond the good will derived from diplomacy. The Egyptians are eager to secure the Rafah border as part of a broader effort to halt weapons smuggling into Sinai, where they are fighting an Islamic State affiliate.But while a rapprochement between Hamas and Mr. Abbas\u2019s Fatah faction, which dominates the Palestinian Authority, poses the tantalizing prospect of a united Palestinian front facing Israel in potential peace talks, a unity government involving Hamas could violate congressional rules against funding terrorist organizations. That, in turn, could cause the Trump administration to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid to the Palestinians. A similar deal between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in 2011 prompted threatened funding cuts.Speaking at a ceremony marking 100 years since the death of a Zionist heroine, the Jewish spy Sarah Aaronsohn, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel commended Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s statement. \u201cWe want peace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a genuine peace, and because of this we will not conduct negotiations with a terrorist organization in diplomatic disguise.\u201dNotably, Israeli statements on the Palestinian reconciliation effort, including Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s latest, appear to leave narrow but perceptible wiggle room for reaching an accommodation.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s vow not to \u201cconduct negotiations with a terrorist organization\u201d ignored that Israel had done precisely that a quarter century ago. In 1993, Israel reached a historic agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel had long considered a terrorist group, and which, unlike the Palestinian Authority, remains its official negotiating partner.Under the reconciliation effort, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ministers who are resuming their functions in Gaza are technocrats who were installed as part of a 2014 national consensus government, to which Israel and the United States do not object, given that the ministers include no Hamas members.This time around, Hamas has so far refused to consider disarming its fighters and has insisted that it remains dedicated to liberating Palestine, not embracing Mr. Abbas\u2019s project of a two-state solution \u2014 despite a new document of principles it released in the spring that accepted the idea of a provisional Palestinian state, without renouncing future claims to the land that is now Israel.Yehya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, sounded a typically fierce note on Thursday: \u201cThe time has passed when Hamas is discussing the issue of recognizing Israel,\u201d he told a group of Gaza youths, according to the Hamas-affiliated Shehab News Agency\u2019s Arabic-language Facebook page. \u201cNow the debate is over when we wipe out Israel.\u201d\u201cNo one can disarm us,\u201d he added.Still, Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s presence in Egypt on Thursday suggested that the United States sees the Fatah-Hamas talks as a chance, however slim, to at least move Hamas in the direction of disarming and embracing the peace process.The militant stance by Hamas leaders poses a problem not only for Israel and the United States, but also for Mr. Abbas, who has vowed not to let Gaza morph into a Lebanon-like situation, where, like Hezbollah, Hamas\u2019s heavily armed fighters wield the ultimate veto power over an enfeebled civilian government that bears responsibility for the difficult work of delivering public services.Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City and Declan Walsh from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Russia Harvested American Rage to Reshape U.S. Politics", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of these were recorded, posted or written by Americans. Yet all ended up becoming grist for a network of Facebook pages linked to a shadowy Russian company that has carried out propaganda campaigns for the Kremlin, and which is now believed to be at the center of a far-reaching Russian program to influence the 2016 presidential election.A New York Times examination of hundreds of those posts shows that one of the most powerful weapons that Russian agents used to reshape American politics was the anger, passion and misinformation that real Americans were broadcasting across social media platforms.Other posts on the Russian pages used stilted language or phrases rarely found in American English. Yet their use of borrowed ideas and arguments from Americans, which were already resonating among conservatives and liberals, demonstrated a deft understanding of the political terrain. The Russians also paid Facebook to promote their posts in the feeds of American Facebook users, helping them test what content would circulate most widely, and among which audiences.One Russian Facebook page, the United Muslims of America, frequently posted content highlighting discrimination against Muslims. In June 2016, it posted a video originally made by Waqas Shah, 23, an online video creator from Staten Island. In the video, Mr. Shah dressed in a thobe, a traditional ankle-length gown worn by Arab men, walked through New York\u2019s Union Square, where he is shoved and harassed by another actor pretending to be a bully to see how bystanders react.The video ends with Mr. Shah pointing out New York\u2019s hypocrisy: The city claims to be a \u201cmelting pot,\u201d but no one intervened while he was getting harassed. Mr. Shah\u2019s original video, posted on YouTube in June 2016, was a viral hit that attracted more than three million views. A week after he posted it, United Muslims of America copied the video to its group page without the original YouTube link, a process known as ripping. There, Mr. Shah\u2019s video become the Russian page\u2019s most popular post, earning more than 150,000 interactions.Mr. Shah said when he noticed the ripped video, he wrote to the administrator of the United Muslims account, asking them to add the link to his original YouTube video. His main concern, Mr. Shah said, was that the page was stealing his views. Told that his video had been used by Russian accounts to sow division in the United States, Mr. Shah said there wasn\u2019t anything he could do about it.\u201cThere are always going to be people who manipulate things to their agenda,\u201d he said.When Being Patriotic posted a brief message last year rallying Americans against proposals to expand refugee settlements in the United States, it was liked, shared or otherwise engaged with by more than 750,000 Facebook users. Eventually, it came across the feed of Len Swanson, 64, a Republican activist from Houston and an avid Trump supporter.\u201cI usually publish an article several times a week, to keep driving the narrative,\u201d Mr. Swanson said in an interview. He was not bothered, he said, by becoming an unwitting cog in the Russian propaganda machine. \u201cYou know we do the same damn thing over there,\u201d Mr. Swanson said. \u201cWhat do you think \u2014 we\u2019re saints?\u201dAs lawmakers debate tighter regulation for companies like Facebook, the trail of Russian digital bread crumbs underscores how difficult it will be to purge social media networks of foreign influence, or even to hamper the covert propaganda campaigns carried out on social platforms by Russia, China and other countries.Copying other people\u2019s content without proper attribution can be a violation of the social networks\u2019 rules. But the content itself \u2014 the videos, posts and Instagram memes borrowed and shared on the Russian pages \u2014 are not explicitly violent or discriminatory, so they do not violate the rules of those services. Instead, they are precisely the type of engaging content these platforms are hungry for.The Russian campaign also appears to have been tailored to exploit the companies\u2019 own strategies for keeping users engaged. Facebook, for example, pushed people to interact more in Groups like the ones set up by the Russians, where users can \u201cshare their common interests and express their opinion\u201d around a common cause. LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by Microsoft, is geared toward encouraging users like Mr. Swanson to create articles and other content.\u201cThe strategies are no mystery,\u201d said Michael Strangelove, a lecturer on internet culture at the University of Ottawa. \u201cForeign powers are playing within the rules of the game that we wrote.\u201dA spokesman for Facebook declined to comment. LinkedIn said Mr. Swanson\u2019s post did not violate the site\u2019s terms of service.\u201cThe challenges posed by the dissemination of fake news and other harmful content through technology platforms are serious,\u201d said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. \u201cWe actively address suspected violations of LinkedIn\u2019s terms of service such as harassment, fake profiles, and misinformation on our platform.\u201dThe Russians appear to have insinuated themselves across American social media platforms and used the same promotional tools that people employ to share cat videos, airline complaints and personal rants. Many of the posts on Being Patriotic also match pre-made, shareable graphics on sites like ConservativeMemes.com, nestled alongside other conservative content made for sharing on social media.Boosted by Russian accounts, the material was quickly picked up by other American users of Facebook, spreading the posts to an even bigger audience. The Russian presence appeared to be layered throughout different platforms: Some of the Facebook accounts, including Being Patriotic, had linked accounts on Instagram and Twitter, according to deleted content captured in Google\u2019s cache.John W. Kelly, the founder of Graphika, a commercial analytics company in New York, said the Russians appeared to have a consistent strategy across different platforms. Graphika has tracked thousands of social media accounts whose content closely tracks Russian information operations, promoting articles and videos about WikiLeaks dumps of stolen emails and \u201cfalse flag\u201d conspiracies about Syrian chemical weapons.The Russian accounts intermingle with real groups of Facebook or Twitter users \u2014 from white nationalists to Bernie Sanders supporters \u2014 and seek to manipulate and radicalize them, Mr. Kelly said.Rather than construct fake grass-roots support behind their ideas \u2014 the public relations strategy known as \u201cAstroturfing\u201d \u2014 the Russians sought to cultivate and influence real political movements, Mr. Kelly said.\u201cIt isn\u2019t Astroturfing \u2014 they\u2019re throwing seeds and fertilizer onto social media,\u201d said Mr. Kelly. \u201cYou want to grow it, and infiltrate it so you can shape it a little bit.\u201dNick Confessore reported from New York and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "A Mushroom Out of a Fairy Tale That You Might Find in the Forest", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe fly agaric is the quintessential mushroom of fairy tales.Its big, bright fruiting bodies scatter in great numbers across mossy forests of North America and Europe. They emerge from the soil first like white eggs, abandoned by some mysterious creature of the woods. They can grow up to a foot tall, as warts appear on the cap. The mushroom often blushes red in the process.Finally, they crack open and flatten into a polka-dot disc that would make a gnome\u2019s perfect dinner plate.For many Eastern Europeans, mushroom hunting is a tradition. For some, it\u2019s also a way to earn extra cash. For Csaba Reisz, a fertilizer salesman and soil nutrition consultant in southern Hungary, it\u2019s escape from work stress. \u201cI make everything right with a little mushroom hunting and photo shooting,\u201d he wrote in an email.A few times a month, he wanders the forest looking for fungal beauty and shows his children the best finds.

{"Headline": "For Sebastian Kurz, Austria\u2019s 31-Year-Old New Leader, a Swift Rise", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 Supporters see him as the future of a country that tends to define itself more through its past than its prospects. Detractors consider him a presumptuous climber who out-demagogued populists in a ruthless grab at power.Preliminary results released on Monday showed his party winning 31.4 percent of the vote, upstaging the far-right Freedom Party, which had capitalized on a backlash against the arrival of nearly 100,000 migrants in Austria in 2015.With nearly all ballots counted, the Social Democrats, with 26.9 percent of the vote, edged ahead of the Freedom Party, with 26 percent. They are believed to be the most likely partner for Mr. Kurz as he tries to create a majority needed to form a government.\u201cIt didn\u2019t go too well,\u201d he recalled, pacing and looking pensive in an open-collared shirt. \u201cThey gave me the sense that I should get back to them in a couple of years. That experience left me with the idea that politics should actually be something where everyone can participate. Where anyone who wants to can get involved.\u201dMr. Kurz persisted, eventually joining the party and working his way up through the youth wing to become its leader in 2009. Two years later, he became a political appointee in the Interior Ministry and in 2013 won a seat in the national Parliament and became the country\u2019s integration minister. The following year, he became Austria\u2019s youngest foreign minister, at 27, and a figure on Europe\u2019s international stage, in his trim navy suits, often worn without a tie.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Instead of viewing Mr. Kurz\u2019s youth as a liability, Mr. Dobretsberger, an 80-year-old former banker, believes that is the young candidate\u2019s strength.\u201cIn Austria, we have strong, but old-fashioned industries,\u201d Mr. Dobretsberger said. \u201cUnlike in Silicon Valley or in Korea, we are too reliant on the service sector and that needs to be changed. I think not him as a person, but the momentum he has generated, will make that possible.\u201dBut as Alexandra Siegl, a Vienna-based political analyst, points out, Mr. Kurz understood how to capitalize on Austrians\u2019 fears over the arrival of thousands of immigrants from the Middle East from 2015 to 2016. From the strain they placed on the country\u2019s welfare system to the threat that Islamic extremists may be among them, his position seemed ripped from the populist playbook.\u201cMr. Kurz took on similar, if not exactly the same position as the Freedom Party,\u201d Ms. Siegl said. Members of the far-right party complained that the young minister had copied their ideas.He also sold himself as having closed the so-called Balkan route, after having defied the promise by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany of a \u201cwelcoming culture,\u201d by reaching agreements with countries in Austria\u2019s southwest to close their borders.Some Austrians disparaged the swing to the right that the election represented and that is likely to continue under Mr. Kurz. Among them was J\u00f6rg Heiser, an Austrian who teaches as the Berlin University of Arts, who in a Facebook post called Mr. Kurz \u201ca sort of Orban in Macron clothing,\u201d a reference to Viktor Orban, the populist Hungarian leader who has exhibited strong authoritarian leanings, and Emmanuel Macron, the centrist, technocratic young president of France.Ms. Merkel congratulated Mr. Kurz on Sunday, after it became clear his party had emerged as the winner. On Monday she praised his \u201cmodern\u201d campaign style, but with an eye to the likelihood that Mr. Kurz will build a coalition with the Freedom party, she cautioned that she would not be trying to copy it for Germany.Mr. Kurz also has his critics at home, where the speed at which he rose through the party\u2019s ranks and the seeming unwillingness of many local media outlets to sufficiently challenge him.\u201cThe party saw him as a Messiah, a young man who was going to come and be their savior,\u201d said Josef Redl, an economics reporter for the left-leaning weekly Falter. \u201cAll he campaigned on was immigration, and he got away with it.\u201dOn the morning after the election, as the country chewed over the outcome and waited for the final result to be announced, most likely on Thursday, many were quick to point out that governing may prove more challenging than campaigning.\u201cMr. Kurz promised many things, these promises demand upholding,\u201d wrote Dietmar Neuwirth in the Austrian newspaper Die Presse. \u201cAfter achieving a turnaround of the People\u2019s Party, Mr. Kurz must achieve a turnaround for Austria.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the election outcome for the Social Democrats. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, the party finished in second place, not third. It was not the case that they failed to place first or second for the first time in a century.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the (Rising) Trail of Thai Food in America", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Crunchy hearts of palm and giant shrimp stir-fried with holy basil and the perfect ration of red chiles. A green papaya salad, freshly shredded and mashed with an extra portion of tiny Thai limes.There was a downside to living in Bangkok for a decade as a New York Times correspondent and being surrounded by great Thai dishes like those: It really raised the bar for when I moved back to America.Last year, a few weeks after my family and I arrived in the United States for a new posting and a new life, we went to a Thai restaurant in Manhattan where my son, then 9, casually rattled off an order of one of his favorites, pad see ew gai \u2014 stir-fried rice noodles with chicken, garlic, leafy greens and a mixture of dark and light soy sauce.The Thai waiter, having not encountered many American children who speak Thai, was charmed. He doted on my son, and after he had delivered the food made a standard Thai inquiry: Is it delicious?I\u2019ve heard lots of explanations. One is the persistence of a belief \u2014 not unfounded \u2014 among some Thai chefs that Westerners like their food sweet and can\u2019t handle spice.When I was living in Bangkok, a Thai friend told me she had worked in the kitchen of a Thai restaurant in Austria. I asked her whether it was difficult to cook for farangs, the term Thais use to describe Europeans and Americans.\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou pretend you are cooking for children.\u201dThai food is not the only cuisine to have been transformed in the journey across oceans. But I\u2019ve made it my mission to track down good Thai cooking in the Bay Area, where I am now the Times bureau chief. I quiz every Thai person I meet, trade tips with diplomats and scour the streets for high-end and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that hold promise.When his parents opened their first Thai restaurant in the late 1980s, they made their dishes milder and sweeter to attract diners unfamiliar with the cuisine. \u201cThe last thing any chef wants is to get the food sent back.\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to play on the safer side.\u201dIn California, the change has come in part because the Thai population has reached a critical mass: The Thai Consulate in Los Angeles estimates that there are more than 200,000 Thais in the state, enough to have restaurants that cater only to them.San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin district, the epicenter of the down-and-out in a city that has become largely unaffordable to all but the very wealthy, is also home to some of the city\u2019s best Thai food.\u201cI didn\u2019t care whether farangs liked it,\u201d he said. He also didn\u2019t care that many customers couldn\u2019t properly pronounce the name (layre rote tie), which means \u201cexcellent taste.\u201d Now he has three branches, and two-thirds of his customers are not Thai. The image of farangs with unsophisticated palates is out of date, Mr. Narupon said.For years, Thai chefs in America pointed out that fresh ingredients were not available; they were forced to buy Thai vegetables frozen or out of a can. That has changed with the intertwining of immigrant groups in California.Thai chefs today describe an informal partnership with ethnic Hmong refugees from Laos who came to America after the Vietnam War. Many settled as farmers in California\u2019s Central Valley.It\u2019s a classic American and Californian story: The Hmong farmers grow herbs and plants essential to Southeast Asian cooking, and the Thai chefs rejoice over access to freshly plucked Kaffir lime leaves; calamansi, a small citrus fruit akin to a kumquat; unripened papayas ready to be shredded into som tam, and the chickpea-size Thai eggplant found in dishes like green curry.The Hmong grow cilantro, for decades a staple of California cuisine; they know not to slice off the roots, which are used in Thai soups, chili pastes and meat marinades.Michael Yang, a Hmong immigrant who works for a University of California agricultural program in Fresno, has helped organize small-scale Hmong farmers to sell Asian vegetables and herbs to restaurants, grocery stores and farmers\u2019 markets in the Bay Area. \u201cWe took a full busload of farmers to meet with restaurant owners,\u201d Mr. Yang said, describing a trip three years ago. \u201cWe wanted them to make connections.\u201dWhen he began working with the farmers 24 years ago, they were growing about 50 varieties of Asian vegetables and herbs. Now they grow more than 200. \u201cThe list just goes on,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cI\u2019m still discovering new crops that are coming in.\u201dKin Khao breaks the mold of Thai restaurants in a number of ways. The staff is a mix of Thai and non-Thai. There are no wooden elephants and pictures of Thai landmarks; in an otherwise sparse wood-and-white dining room, Ms. Pim has chosen a Thai accent mark, mai toh, as the restaurant\u2019s icon.My favorite dish there so far is a yam som-o, which is normally made from pomelo, a citrus fruit the size of a cantaloupe that grows in the tropics. This version is a medley of citrus fruits \u2014 pomelo, grapefruit, blood orange \u2014 mixed with small fried shrimp, cilantro, peanuts, shallots, mint and toasted coconut.Sometimes an item on the menu is followed by this: \u201cWarning: This is not Thai food for beginners.\u201dMs. Pim described one such dish, namprik long rua, an intensely spicy sauce. \u201cIt\u2019s got shrimp paste, it\u2019s got a lot of garlic, it\u2019s served with raw vegetables, some of them quite bitter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to hurt you, probably for a couple of days.\u201d (Another convention that Kin Khao breaks is price. A solo dinner a few months ago cost me more than $100. My crab meat and betel leaf curry was delicious, but set me back $55.)The worst pad thai Ms. Leela had in America was in a restaurant in Detroit. The Thai waitress warned her not to eat it, but Ms. Leela says she wanted to experiment. \u201cIt was really, really bad,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe server was looking at me with a puppy face that said, \u2018Sorry\u2019 and \u2018I told you so.\u2019\u201dHow to find flavorful dishes in Thai restaurants that tailor their food for American tastes? I usually speak Thai in the hope that servers will take me seriously. Ms. Leela asks the staff what they would serve if their parents came to the restaurant.I told her nine.

{"Headline": "B Capital Hires Howard L. Morgan as Its New Chairman", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 During his long career, Howard L. Morgan has been an early executive at Renaissance Technologies, the giant hedge fund, and a co-founder of First Round Capital, the venture capital firm.His next role: joining the venture capital fund co-led by Eduardo Saverin, one of the co-founders of Facebook.Mr. Saverin\u2019s venture capital firm, B Capital Group, announced on Monday that it had hired Mr. Morgan as its chairman.It also announced other personnel moves, including the naming of Joe Davis, the chairman of the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s North American operations, as vice chairman; the hiring of Allen Duan as an operating partner; and the hiring of Rohit Bhagat as a senior adviser.The addition of Mr. Morgan and the other executives is meant to bolster B Capital, which looks to invest in start-ups around the world. The firm was created two years ago by Mr. Saverin, who is now based in Singapore, and Raj Ganguly, who is based on the West Coast. It also has a strategic partnership with the Boston Consulting Group, which can both help find potential investments and recommend the firm to start-ups in search of capital.\u201cHoward, at the end of the day, is a giant in the industry,\u201d Mr. Saverin said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou can gain a tremendous amount of perspective just from speaking with him for a couple of minutes.\u201dMr. Morgan, 71, turned from academia to investing in the early 1980s, when he headed venture investments for the then-nascent Renaissance Technologies hedge fund for nearly a decade. He later helped found Idealab, a foundry for start-ups.In 2004, he co-founded First Round Capital, the seed-stage investment firm that was an early investor in Uber, with Josh Kopelman and other partners. And he has served as a guide to other young investors, including those at B Capital.\u201cThe reason we\u2019re so excited to have Howard on the team is that he\u2019s been an adviser and mentor to us since our inception,\u201d Mr. Ganguly said.Mr. Morgan began stepping back from his duties at First Round Capital about five years ago. But Mr. Saverin and Mr. Ganguly told him earlier this year that they wanted to bring him on board to help build and develop B Capital.\u201cWhat Eduardo and Raj wanted from me was help and experience really building a culture,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cHow do you make a physically distributed organization really feel like one company?\u201dMr. Morgan then conducted more due diligence on the firm, including by spending time with Rich Lesser, the chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group.Ultimately, Mr. Morgan said, the opportunity to help another budding venture firm grow proved too attractive to pass up.One primary focus for B Capital will remain finding investments outside of Silicon Valley and China, including in Southeast Asia.\u201cAsia is simply a massive market with opportunities that abound,\u201d Mr. Saverin said, pointing to the region\u2019s embrace of mobile technologies. \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredibly exciting economy to invest in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Appetite for Emojis Complicates the Effort to Standardize the World\u2019s Alphabets", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "FeatureDo the volunteers behind Unicode, whose mission is to bring all human languages into the digital sphere, have enough bandwidth to deal with emojis too?Supported byPandey eventually identified the script as an alphabet for Rohingya, the language spoken by the stateless and persecuted Muslim people whose greatest numbers live in western Myanmar, where they\u2019ve been the victims of brutal ethnic cleansing. Pandey wasn\u2019t sure if the alphabet itself was in use anymore, until he lucked upon contemporary pictures of printed textbooks for children. That meant it wasn\u2019t a historical footnote; it was alive.An email query from Pandey bounced from expert to expert until it landed with Muhammad Noor, a Rohingya activist and television host who was living in Malaysia. He told Pandey the short history of this alphabet, which was developed in the 1980s by a group of scholars that included a man named Mohammed Hanif. It spread slowly through the 1990s in handwritten, photocopied books. After 2001, thanks to two computer fonts designed by Noor, it became possible to type the script in word-processing programs. But no email, text messages or (later) tweets could be sent or received in it, no Google searches conducted in it. The Rohingya had no digital alphabet of their own through which they could connect with one another.Billions of people around the world no longer face this plight. Whether on computers or smartphones, they can write as they write, expressing themselves in their own linguistic culture. What makes this possible is a 26-year-old international industrial standard for text data called the Unicode standard, which prescribes the digital letters, numbers and punctuation marks of more than 100 different writing systems: Greek, Cherokee, Arabic, Latin, Devanagari \u2014 a world-spanning storehouse of languages. But the alphabet that Noor described wasn\u2019t among them, and neither are more than 100 other scripts, just over half of them historical and the rest alphabets that could still be used by as many as 400 million people today.Now a computational linguist and motivated by a desire to put his historical knowledge to use, Pandey knows how to get obscure alphabets into the Unicode standard. Since 2005, he has done so for 19 writing systems (and he\u2019s currently working to add another eight). With Noor\u2019s help, and some financial support from a research center at the University of California, Berkeley, he drew up the basic set of letters and defined how they combine, what rules govern punctuation and whether spaces exist between words, then submitted a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the organization that maintains the standards for digital scripts. In 2018, seven years after Pandey\u2019s discovery, what came to be called Hanifi Rohingya will be rolled out in Unicode\u2019s 11th version. The Rohingya will be able to communicate online with one another, using their own alphabet.As a practical matter, this will not have much impact for the Rohingya who are suffering in Myanmar, many of whom are illiterate and shut off from educational and technological opportunity. \u201cThe spread of this new digital system is unlikely to go to scale,\u201d Maung Zarni, a human rights activist who works on Rohingya issues, and Natalie Brinham, a Ph.D. fellow at Queen Mary University of London, told me in an email. They emphasized that the Rohingya do not have the autonomy to organize their own schools. But given the group\u2019s history of oppression, the encoding of their language carries considerable symbolic weight because it legitimizes an oppressed minority and their language. \u201cIt becomes a tool of unity to help people come together,\u201d Noor says.Creating such interconnectedness and expanding the linguistic powers of technology users around the world is the whole point of Unicode. If the work is slow, that\u2019s because standardizing a writing system for computers is a delicate art that relies on both engineering and diplomacy. And the time and attention of the volunteers who maintain the standard are finite. So what happens when a new system of visual communication like emoji emerges and comes under their purview? Things get even slower and the mission more complicated.At the time, computing in the United States relied on encodings like those from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (usually known as ASCII), which assigned numerical identifiers to letters, numbers, punctuation and behaviors (like \u201cindent\u201d). The capital letter \u201cA,\u201d for instance, had an ASCII code of 065, or 01000001 in the 0s and 1s in the binary code of computers. Each textual character used by a computer needs its own unique sequence, a numerical identifier or \u201ccharacter encoding.\u201d The problem with ASCII was that it had only 256 codes to distribute and far more than 256 characters in the world needing identifiers.In order to work with more writing systems than ASCII was able to handle, technology companies like Apple, Xerox, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and even Kodak created their proprietary encodings. None of them worked with the others. To complicate things further, some nations insisted as a matter of national pride on their own standards for text data. \u201cThe proliferation of character encodings was chaos,\u201d Whistler says.Joe Becker gathered like-minded computer scientists to bring order to the chaos, arguing that cooperation was needed among companies. The result was the Unicode Consortium, which was incorporated in 1991. He also maintained that the solution had to be international and helped broker an alliance with the International Organization for Standardization, which maintains more than 20,000 standards related to products and services, from the tensile strength of yarn to the chemical composition of toys. Such standards are meant to ensure, among other things, that things from one country can be used in the industrial processes of another. Standardized shipping containers, for instance, have made international commerce far more efficient. Standards don\u2019t become regulations; they\u2019re conventions, \u201crecipes for reality\u201d in the words of Lawrence Busch, a sociologist emeritus at Michigan State University who studies how standards arise. Unicode unified all the numerical identifiers and made sure they were reliable and up-to-date.As is the case in other standards organizations, full membership in the nonprofit Unicode Consortium comes with the right to vote on changes to the standard. Membership dues are $18,000 annually; current full members include global tech giants (like Apple, Facebook and Google) and the Sultanate of Oman (which wants to see digital Arabic improved). A second membership tier includes a university, government bodies in Bangladesh and India, a typeface company and an emoji search engine. Over the years, members came and went, depending on their immediate interest in issues of standardization.Unicode\u2019s idealistic founders intended to bring the personal-computing revolution to everyone on the planet, regardless of language. \u201cThe people who really got the bug,\u201d Whistler says, \u201csaw themselves at an inflection point in history and their chance to make a difference.\u201d No fortunes have been made through Unicode, unless you count the platforms (like Twitter) and products (like the iPhone) that adopted the standard.Unicode\u2019s history is full of attacks by governments, activists and eccentrics. In the early 1990s, the Chinese government objected to the encoding of Tibetan. About five years ago, Hungarian nationalists tried to sabotage the encoding for Old Hungarian because they wanted it to be called \u201cSzekley-Hungarian Rovas\u201d instead. An encoding for an alphabet used to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit was delayed a few years ago by ethnonationalists who mistrusted the proposal because they objected to the author\u2019s surname. Over and over, the Unicode Consortium has protected its standard from such political attacks.The standard\u2019s effectiveness helped. \u201cIf standards work, they\u2019re invisible and can be ignored by the public,\u201d Busch says. Twenty years after its first version, Unicode had become the default text-data standard, adopted by device manufacturers and software companies all over the world. Each version of the standard ushered more users into a seamless digital world of text. \u201cWe used to ask ourselves, \u2018How many years do you think the consortium will need to be in place before we can publish the last version?\u2019\u2009\u201d Whistler recalls. The end was finally in sight \u2014 at one point the consortium had barely more than 50 writing systems to add.All that changed in October 2010, when that year\u2019s version of the Unicode standard included its first set of emojis.In the late 1990s, when Japanese phone manufacturers first put emojis on their devices as marketing gimmicks, messaging standards required that emojis be sent as text data \u2014 as characters matched to strings of numbers, not as images. But emojis were unreadable on devices that couldn\u2019t translate their numerical identifiers.When a software engineer named Graham Asher suggested in 2000 that Unicode take responsibility for emojis, the consortium demurred on the grounds that pictures were subjectively interpreted. A few years later, companies like Apple and Microsoft realized that the increasingly popular Japanese emojis would appear as gibberish on their products and pushed the consortium to encode them. By 2009, 974 emojis had been assigned numerical identifiers, which were released the following year.As the demand for new emojis surged, so, too, did the criticisms. White human figures didn\u2019t reflect the diversity of real skin colors. Many emojis for specific professions (like police officer and construction worker) had only male figures, while icons for foods didn\u2019t represent what people around the world actually ate. Millions of users wanted to communicate using the language of emoji, and as consumers, they expected change to be swift. One thing appeared to be slowing things down: the Unicode Consortium.At Emojicon, resentment toward Unicode was simmering amid the emoji karaoke, emoji improv and talks on emoji linguistics. \u201cSuch a 1980s sci-fi villain name,\u201d one participant grumbled. \u201cWho put them in charge?\u201d A student from Rice University, Mark Bramhill, complained that the requirements for the yoga-pose emoji he had proposed were off-puttingly specific, almost as if they were meant to deter him. A general antiestablishment frustration seemed to be directed at the ruling organization. One speaker, Latoya Peterson, the deputy editor of digital innovation for ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Undefeated,\u201d urged people to submit proposals to Unicode for more diverse emojis. \u201cWe are the internet!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is us!\u201dOn the first morning of Emojicon, Mark Davis, president of Unicode, explained in a talk that the consortium also maintains the repository for time and date formats, currency and language names and other information that adapts computer functions to where a user is. Even more demanding technically is making sure that characters behave as users want them to. One major achievement has been ironing out how right-to-left alphabets like Arabic are used in the same line of text as left-to-right ones like Latin, which affects billions of users and can take years to adjust. Dealing with emojis, in short, is a small, though increasing, part of the consortium\u2019s responsibilities.Davis mentioned that once characters become part of the Unicode standard, they\u2019re never removed. This inspired one young designer in the audience to announce that he\u2019d ensure his legacy by proposing emojis until one was accepted. The crowd laughed; Davis smiled coolly, perhaps because Unicode committees have been overwhelmed with some 500 submissions in the last three years.Not everyone thinks that Unicode should be in the emoji business at all. I met several people at Emojicon promoting apps that treat emojis like pictures, not text, and I heard an idea floated for a separate standards body for emojis run by people with nontechnical backgrounds. \u201cNormal people can have an opinion about why there isn\u2019t a cupcake emoji,\u201d said Jennifer 8. Lee, an entrepreneur and a film producer whose advocacy on behalf of a dumpling emoji inspired her to organize Emojicon. The issue isn\u2019t space \u2014 Unicode has about 800,000 unused numerical identifiers \u2014 but about whose expertise and worldview shapes the standard and prioritizes its projects.\u201cEmoji has had a tendency to subtract attention from the other important things the consortium needs to be working on,\u201d Ken Whistler says. He believes that Unicode was right to take responsibility for emoji, because it has the technical expertise to deal with character chaos (and has dealt with it before). But emoji is an unwanted distraction. \u201cWe can spend hours arguing for an emoji for chopsticks, and then have nobody in the room pay any attention to details for what\u2019s required for Nepal, which the people in Nepal use to write their language. That\u2019s my main concern: emoji eats the attention span both in the committee and for key people with other responsibilities.\u201dEmoji has nonetheless provided a boost to Unicode. Companies frequently used to implement partial versions of the standard, but the spread of emoji now forces them to adopt more complete versions of it. As a result, smartphones that can manage emoji will be more likely to have Hanifi Rohingya on them too. The stream of proposals also makes the standard seem alive, attracting new volunteers to Unicode\u2019s mission. It\u2019s not unusual for people who come to the organization through an interest in emoji to end up embracing its priorities. \u201cWorking on characters used in a small province of China, even if it\u2019s 20,000 people who are going to use it, that\u2019s a more important use of their time than deliberating over whether the hand of my yoga emoji is in the right position,\u201d Mark Bramhill told me.Since its creation was announced in 2015, the \u201cAdopt a Character\u201d program, through which individuals and organizations can sponsor any characters, including emojis, has raised more than $200,000. A percentage of the proceeds goes to support the Script Encoding Initiative, a research project based at Berkeley, which is headed by the linguistics researcher Deborah Anderson, who is devoted to making Unicode truly universal. One the consortium recently accepted is called Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, devised for the Hmong language by a minister in California whose parishioners have been using it for more than 25 years. Still in the proposal stage is Tigalari, once used to write Sanskrit and other Indian languages.One way to read the story of Unicode in the time of emoji is to see a privileged generation of tech consumers confronting the fact that they can\u2019t communicate in ways they want to on their devices: through emoji. They get involved in standards-making, which yields them some satisfaction but slows down the speed with which millions of others around the world get access to the most basic of online linguistic powers. \u201cThere are always winners and losers in standards,\u201d Lawrence Busch says. \u201cYou might want to say, ultimately we\u2019d like everyone to win and nobody to lose too much, but we\u2019re stuck with the fact that we have to make decisions, and when we make them, those decisions are going to be less acceptable to some than to others.\u201dMichael Erard is writer in residence at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics and the author of \u2018\u2018Babel No More: The Search for the World\u2019s Most Extraordinary Language Learners.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

All this hair is starting conversations, and copycats, in the barbershops around Houston \u2014 especially those owned by Dominican, Cuban and Puerto Rican people. \u201cLa Pi\u00f1a, I think, was fundamentally Yuli\u2019s idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t think it was going to cause this sensation.\u201dA couple of years ago, one of Mr. Quiles\u2019s friends asked if he could cut a client\u2019s hair. The client happened to be Alex Cintr\u00f3n, a former major league player. \u201cHe said he liked the cut, and asked if I would be willing to cut some of the other players\u2019 hair.\u201d Soon, Mr. Quiles was being called to the field in downtown Houston to tend to Astros players between games. He says he was star-struck at first. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it because the players had my phone number and I\u2019d look down and, wow, Marwin Gonz\u00e1lez is calling me.\u201d His ability to translate a client\u2019s idea into blended fades flawless enough to tolerate a zooming high-definition camera has put Mr. Quiles in high demand. The signature style Mr. Quiles leaves on the heads of Houston players has created a surge of requests around the city\u2019s barbershops for similar looks. Ray Davis, the owner of a barbershop down the street from Cadillax, said, \u201cJust in the past two weeks, there\u2019s been a lot of interest in getting Astros cuts.\u201dAnd if they\u2019re not looking to imitate the style of the players, Mr. Davis said, then customers come in wanting variations of the Astros logo in their hair.On the other side of the city, the Caribbean Barber Shop sits in a strip mall alongside a money-sending service and a Puerto Rican juice store specializing in spicy mango treats. Around 5 o\u2019clock on Sunday, with the first pitch of Game 5 just two hours away, a table was brought into the barbershop, onto which dominoes were dumped and mixed.Soon Dos Equis were popped and nestled into the corner holders. The last clients of the day finished off their looks. Around town, an atmosphere of sizzling excitement has permeated the city\u2019s Caribbean salons, as customers and barbers alike gather to celebrate, and argue about, their baseball team and its stars. In recent years, hairstyles came from San Juan, Santo Domingo and Havana. The attention-grabbing haircuts that many men in those cities wear can be head-turning. Mr. Gurriel and Mr. Puig are Cuban. Mr. Correa is Puerto Rican. Mr. Springer is from Connecticut, and his family is Puerto Rican and Panamanian. \u201cI think you can tell a Caribbean person just by their haircut,\u201d Mr. Quiles said.The Caribbean players have a \u201cstylized way of playing baseball, and that style translates to their pride in their look,\u201d said Rob Ruck, a professor of sport history at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cWhat\u2019s really cool is that the styles being pioneered in the Caribbean are now evident in major league baseball.\u201d Roberto Alvarez is a Cuban barber with a pop-up \u201cmini-salon\u201d in Havana that draws long lines of men looking for fades. Some of the hottest cuts in Havana today? El yonki (a tall, wide crest), el tibur\u00f3n (a low-cut mohawk) and el dominicano (short, with longer hair in front). Mr. Alvarez doesn\u2019t like Puig\u2019s tibur\u00f3n (shark). He thinks it is \u201csuper-simple\u201d and \u201cwithout much quality, believe me,\u201d he wrote over chat on Facebook. But the pineapple, on the other hand, as created by Mr. Gurriel and Mr. Quiles, is \u201cvery good.\u201dSo what makes a good cut? Nandy Mercado, a passionate young Puerto Rican barber at the shop where Mr. Quiles works, broke it down while he finished off a Springer-inspired pompadour cut. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see heavy darkness, or one side that\u2019s blended higher than another,\u201d he said. He said barbers are wildly competitive, and he made sure to mention that he doesn\u2019t sketch \u2014 meaning he doesn\u2019t outline a design before he cuts it, nor does he shade, using paint to fix mistakes or darken areas. Instead, with great precision, he uses a blade to freestyle his designs, a technique that has taken him almost a decade to perfect. At Cadillax Barber Shop, the flag on the wall is Puerto Rican, and the customers are Texan, but the owner is a Dodgers fan. He keeps the salon colors blue and white. Mr. Mercado, an Astros fan, said that he doesn\u2019t mind, and that \u201cit\u2019s nice to have a little witty banter\u201d in the salon. He also thinks it\u2019s no coincidence the Astros are in the World Series. \u201cI think the secret sauce is the haircut,\u201d he said, completely serious.\u201cWhen you look good, you feel good.

{"Headline": "A Roadshow of Hate: Supremacist Rallies Fueled by Travelers From Afar", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree of Mr. Spencer\u2019s disciples from Texas pulled up in a car alongside a group of anti-Spencer demonstrators, and soon, the police said, one of the three began to chant \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d After a protester hit the car with a baton, one of the Texas men pulled out a handgun and fired a shot.No one was injured, but the episode underscored a reality of the alt-right movement: that it draws energy, and some of its most violent support, from out-of-town sympathizers who regularly travel hundreds of miles to public events starring figures like Mr. Spencer.\u201cThe movement has fundamentally changed, since people want to come to these to meet others, to feel a part of the team, so to speak, and to also demonstrate to the outside world that this a real movement and that we want a place at the table,\u201d Mr. Spencer said in an interview on Friday. \u201cActivism is not purely the domain of the left.\u201dSome demonstrators travel alone, and others car-pool with people from their regions in pickup trucks and rented vans. They stay in motel rooms, often far enough from the events to avoid detection, or on campgrounds after trading suggestions on Facebook, Gab and Twitter.On Friday, about 20 demonstrators, including Harry Hughes from Arizona, had dinner together at an Olive Garden.\u201cI come to these events routinely because I think we have a message, and we also look for reaction from the public,\u201d said Mr. Hughes, a member of a neo-Nazi group, adding that he often includes sightseeing on his trips.Zaine Deal, a Traditional Workers Party member from Ohio who was making a quicker trip to the South, said he and 10 other men had driven to Tennessee on Friday for the weekend\u2019s events and planned to leave on Sunday. They split two hotel rooms.\u201cWe\u2019re guys,\u201d a helmet-wearing Mr. Deal, 18, said at the Shelbyville rally on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re usually arguing about who gets to sleep on the floor.\u201dMr. Deal said he planned to travel for more events to advance the same strains of ideology that apparently led the three men from Texas this month to Florida, where they remained jailed on bonds of at least $1 million each.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to push back, we\u2019re starting to want to intimidate back,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cWe want to show our teeth a little bit because, you know, we\u2019re not to be taken lightly. We don\u2019t want violence, we don\u2019t want harm, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re not opposed to defending ourselves.\u201dOn Friday, asked about the charges against Mr. Fears and the other men, Mr. Spencer said: \u201cIf the allegations are correct, then they really did a bad thing. It\u2019s not defensible, to be honest.\u201dBut Mr. Spencer and his allies have no plans to abandon the events that prompt controversy and turmoil. Brad Griffin, the publisher of Occidental Dissent, estimated that up to 90 percent of people at the alt-right\u2019s public events are regulars who travel from afar, a figure Mr. Spencer agreed with. Mr. Griffin said that the movement struggled to attract more local support because of the promise of public condemnation.\u201cWe\u2019re breaking a taboo,\u201d said Mr. Griffin, who also oversees public relations for the League of the South, which describes itself as a \u201cSouthern nationalist\u201d organization, and who helped promote Saturday\u2019s rallies. \u201cWe might have supporters in the area, we might have supporters in the state, but the number of people who are willing to take those risks always reduces turnout.\u201dStarting with the street clashes in Seattle during the World Trade Organization conference in 1999, \u201cyou just see this roving band that was at everything,\u201d said Scott Crow, a longtime liberal activist and author who lives in Texas. \u201cYou\u2019re probably not seeing the same Antifa people at every Richard Spencer rally, but there are people who are probably at many of those things or the big ones.\u201dFederal officials have long paid close attention to activists all along the political spectrum, sometimes infiltrating groups they consider extreme. Yet traveling demonstrators, no matter their ideological alignment, often pose particular challenges for the local authorities, who may have little experience handling volatile protests and limited knowledge about people who come from afar.Social media platforms and the internet only add to the challenge, experts said.

{"Headline": "Google Updates Policy on News Pay Walls. \u2018First Click Free\u2019 to End.", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublications like The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The New York Times have long asked readers to pay for access to online articles. But many reading this article online are probably familiar with an easy workaround: Plug a search term or headline into Google, and voil\u00e0! Free access to articles normally locked behind pay walls.That digital sleight of hand is great for inquisitive readers, but bad for the publishers that are increasingly dependent on subscription dollars for survival.So now, in an acknowledgment of this industrywide strategy shift, Google is working on new tools that could help news organizations bolster their subscription businesses. The tools are part of a broader effort to preserve the kind of journalism that Google\u2019s dominance, and that of other web giants like Facebook, has threatened.Google\u2019s plans include doing away with the \u201cfirst click free\u201d policy, which requires subscription-based news outlets to offer three free articles a day through its search and news features, allowing users to skirt pay walls. A new program, which Google plans to start this week and is calling \u201cflexible sampling,\u201d will allow those publishers to determine how many free clicks to give Google\u2019s users.Google is also looking at ways to help people subscribe to publications more easily, including using machine learning to help publishers tailor options to a reader\u2019s preferences and behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s really all an attempt to try to create a new world \u2014 a better world \u2014 for journalism,\u201d said Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer. And, he added, \u201cwe have an inherent interest in making publishers successful.\u201dGoogle\u2019s new \u201cflexible sampling\u201d program is a twofold attempt to support publishers\u2019 subscription businesses. The company said it was helping publishers embrace a try-before-you-buy approach that it hoped would induce readers to become subscribers. It also said it would index all of a publisher\u2019s articles, regardless of the limit the publisher chooses.Google is recommending that publishers provide 10 free articles on a monthly, rather than a daily, basis.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned over the years as the market has matured is that the one-size-fits-all approach to \u2018first click free\u2019 really doesn\u2019t make sense in this market,\u201d said Richard Gingras, Google\u2019s vice president of news. \u201cWe\u2019re basically saying to the publishers, \u2018You decide how much you want to sample.\u2019\u201dGoogle is also working on tools for publishers to help drive subscriptions. One of the company\u2019s goals, Mr. Gingras said, is to help \u201ctake the friction out of the purchase process\u201d by using its own technological capabilities, as well as the information it has on users \u2014 including email address and credit cards \u2014 to make subscribing simpler. Mr. Gingras said Google expected to begin rolling out its suite of subscription support services in the first half of next year.\u201cWe\u2019re not suggesting this is a magic bullet for growing subscription revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to collaborate \u2014 this is a journey.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unity Deal Offers Hope for Palestinians and a Respite for Gaza", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 After a decade of hostility and recrimination, the two main Palestinian factions came together in Cairo on Thursday to sign a reconciliation deal that holds out the tantalizing prospect of a united Palestinian front.Hopes for the agreement, signed under the watchful eye of Egyptian intelligence, were tempered by the knowledge that many previous Palestinian initiatives have failed. Yet there is optimism that this time may be different, partly because the stakes are so much higher.For the two million Palestinians of Gaza, trapped in a tiny coastal strip that is frequently compared to an open-air prison, the Cairo deal offered a potential respite from their lives of dire shortages of electricity and lifesaving medicine, as well as a chance to travel to the outside world.For the Palestinian leadership, it held out the prospect of negotiating with Israel with a single voice, even as it forced the divided territory\u2019s most radical militants to make painful concessions that acknowledged their own failure to advance their cause.Hamas, which controls Gaza and has fought Israel three times, said it was ready to cede control of Gaza\u2019s borders and allow the rival Palestinian Authority to effectively take over the day-to-day running of the territory.It was a sobering reality check for a group that, despite years of fiery defiance and arms supplies from Iran, cannot rule Gaza without help from Fatah, the rival faction that controls the Palestinian Authority and was driven out of Gaza in violent clashes 10 years ago.And for Mahmoud Abbas, the 82-year-old president of the Palestinian Authority, it could amount to a legacy-saving moment in the twilight years of his rule, after years of abject failure to negotiate a peace settlement with Israel. Although he was not in Cairo, Mr. Abbas gave his blessing to the deal, which he hailed as a \u201cfinal agreement,\u201d according to Agence France-Presse.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that Israel \u201cobjects to any reconciliation that does not include\u201d accepting international agreements, recognizing Israel and disarming Hamas. A Fatah-Hamas rapprochement would make \u201cpeace much harder to achieve,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a post on Facebook. \u201cReconciling with mass-murderers is part of the problem, not part of the solution.\u201dAt a brief ceremony on Thursday at the headquarters of Egypt\u2019s General Intelligence Service, which shepherded the negotiations, representatives from Hamas and Fatah kissed and embraced amid a smattering of applause from Egyptian and Palestinian officials gathered around them.The Palestinians did not release the text of the agreement, and there was no mention of the thorny issues that remain unresolved, such as the fate of the main Hamas militia, or the network of tunnels under Gaza used by fighters and weapons smugglers.But officials from both sides described a series of agreed measures that are due to unfold in the coming weeks, and which they say will both sideline Hamas from the day-to-day running of Gaza and create a political groundswell for a broader deal to reunite the Palestinian territories.Egypt\u2019s State Information Service said that the rivals had agreed to hand full control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority by Dec. 1. Palestinian officials said that if the process goes well, Mr. Abbas could visit Gaza in the coming month, his first visit to the embattled coastal strip in a decade.Egypt has set Nov. 21 for the next step of the process: a meeting in Cairo of all Palestinian factions that, it hopes, will be the start of talks toward a Palestinian unity government. Some Palestinian officials said they hoped such a government could be formed by January.But much depends on how things transpire in Gaza over the coming weeks.Under terms of the deal, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority will form a joint police force of at least 5,000 officers, and merge their ministries. One Hamas official said they would negotiate to slim down the bloated civil service, cutting up to 40,000 of the 200,000 jobs.Two elements of the deal promise to quickly ease conditions in Gaza, which aid organizations have called an emerging humanitarian crisis.And Hamas will cede control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, Gaza\u2019s main lifeline to the outside world. That would allow Egypt to ease stringent cargo restrictions and enable Gazans to travel outside, perhaps the most significant change in the agreement.But even if the two sides succeed in fully reuniting in the next round of talks, the new arrangement seems unlikely to improve relations with Israel, which has warned that it could not accept a unity government that included Hamas.Hamas has insisted on its right to maintain control of its arsenal \u2014 including thousands of rockets, missiles and drones \u2014 as well as its militia and its network of fortified tunnels.Across divided Palestine there were cautious celebrations.In Gaza City, vendors passed out sweets to children in Soldier\u2019s Square, a park at the center of town. Mona Khfaja, 37, a pharmacist who said she was unable to leave Gaza to seek treatment for kidney disease, said dissatisfaction with the crushing border restrictions had forced warring Palestinian leaders to the negotiation table.\u201cWe do not want the flags of Fatah and Hamas, only the Palestinian flag,\u201d she said.In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Abu Ahmad, 56, said he was wary about getting his hopes up. \u201cMany agreements have been signed in the past, but something has always caused these political parties to back away,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s still a chance for that to happen again.\u201dThe signing ceremony on Thursday followed two days of talks mediated by Egypt\u2019s General Intelligence Service. The deal was signed by the deputy leader of Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, and Azzam al-Ahmad, the head of the Fatah delegation.Officials from both sides offered frank appraisals of the issues that divide them, and that could easily scupper this latest effort. Ayman Rigib, a Fatah negotiator in Cairo, pointed to the status of Hamas\u2019s Qassam Brigades, with an estimated 20,000 fighters, and Hamas\u2019s extensive tunnels.\u201cWe\u2019re worried about the tunnels,\u201d Mr. Rigib said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Hamas use them in 2014. Will they give us the maps? Will they shut them down? It has not yet been discussed.\u201dAnother Palestinian concern is that a unity government involving Hamas could cause the Trump administration to cut funding to the Palestinian territories under congressional rules against funding terrorist organizations. American lawmakers threatened to cut funding in reaction to a similar 2011 deal between Hamas, which the United States designates as a terrorist organization, and the Palestinian Authority. That agreement ultimately fell apart.The United States gives the Palestinian Authority about $400 million in annual assistance. But for now, with Hamas ceding all administrative control of Gaza, there is little danger that aid would be cut off.Grant Rumley, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the issues yet to be resolved would be the most difficult. \u201cHamas may be willing to cede more administrative control of Gaza,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the parties have so far avoided the issues likeliest to derail the talks: namely the relationship with Israel and what to do with Hamas\u2019s military wing.\u201dWhen leaders from Hamas and Fatah signed the 2011 deal, Mr. Abbas said, \u201cWe have turned the black page of division forever.\u201d But the agreement quickly foundered amid opposition from Israel, which denounced it as a \u201cvictory for terrorism.\u201dThis time, a broad Arab coalition is backing the deal, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\u201cThis merger is going to cost a lot of money, and they will help us financially,\u201d said Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to the Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, referring to Emirati and Saudi support. \u201cThe Egyptians also clearly got a green light from America. They are obviously trying to cook up something to help end this conflict.\u201dDeclan Walsh reported from Cairo, and David M. Halbfinger from Jerusalem.

{"Headline": "U.S. Expels 15 Cuban Diplomats, in Latest Sign D\u00e9tente May Be Ending", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, escalating his response to a mysterious affliction that has stricken American Embassy personnel in Havana in a move that cast a Cold War chill over relations between the two countries.Still, taken together with a policy directive that Mr. Trump issued in June and a State Department warning last week admonishing Americans not to travel to the island nation, the embassy drawdowns have the potential to freeze the normalization process in its tracks.They make it more difficult for citizens of both countries to engage with each other, imperiling already narrow channels of trade and commerce that opened after the 2014 rapprochement, and all but shutting down the immigration pipeline that allows Cubans to reunite with their families on American soil.But the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, said the Cuban government had not done enough to protect Americans on its soil, and would need to ensure that the illnesses would not continue before personnel in either embassy could return.The number of personnel thought to have been affected has gradually grown over the months, and on Tuesday the State Department added one more to the list, bringing it to 22.In a statement, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the United States was expelling the Cuban diplomats \u201cdue to Cuba\u2019s failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention.\u201d Mr. Tillerson added that \u201cthis order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations.\u201dIn a briefing with reporters Tuesday morning, a State Department official said the Cuban ambassador in Washington was informed of the expulsions in a 9 a.m. phone call from Francisco Palmieri, the top State Department official for the Western Hemisphere. The expelled embassy personnel were given seven days to leave the United States. The American Embassy in Havana will have completed its own drawdown by Friday.\u201cWe continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, \u201cand will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks.\u201dThe Cuban government accused the Trump administration of using the health crisis as an excuse to drive out Cuban diplomats without any proof that Havana was responsible. At a news conference in Havana, Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla, Cuba\u2019s foreign minister, said the move was \u201ceminently political\u201d as well as \u201cunwarranted and unjustifiable.\u201dMr. Rodr\u00edguez faulted the American government for not reporting the ailments its diplomats suffered earlier to authorities in Cuba. The Cuban government, he said, has been denied access to the affected American personnel and the doctors who treated them, which has stymied Cuba\u2019s ability to help with the investigation.\u201cCuba has never perpetrated, and will never perpetrate, any type of attacks against diplomats or their relatives \u2014 no exception,\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said. Nor, he added, would it allow a third party to do so. He dismissed accounts of hearing loss and other symptoms as \u201cscience fiction.\u201dDaniel Erikson, who as a White House and State Department adviser on Latin America during the Obama administration was deeply involved in the 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, said the severe cutback in diplomats in Havana could blind the United States during Cuba\u2019s crucial political transition next year, when President Ra\u00fal Castro is expected to retire and a new generation of leaders take over.\u201cIt looks like what began as a legitimate effort to protect American diplomats from harm is moving to a broader breakdown in U.S.-Cuban relations,\u201d Mr. Erikson said.The expulsions were cheered by opponents of the normalization, including members of the Cuban exile community, historically hostile to a Castro government, and condemned by supporters of warmer relations between Cuba and the United States, who said the move threatened to create a new chapter of hostility and play into the hands of those who wish to drive the two countries apart.It would be especially damaging, proponents of engagement argued, if \u2014 as many current and former officials suspect \u2014 the Cuban government is not behind the attacks.\u201cIf this is not the government, but rather other forces seeking to undermine the U.S.-Cuba relationship, a permanent downgrade would accomplish that objective for them,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the former Obama administration deputy national security adviser who helped to negotiate the move toward normalization.But Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a leading foe of closer relations between the two countries, said the expulsions were a fitting response to Cuba\u2019s misbehavior. He and other Republicans had called on Mr. Tillerson in a letter last month to go a step further, declaring all Cuban diplomats in the United States \u201cpersona non grata,\u201d a dramatic diplomatic stigma that results in banishment with no right to return.With little hard evidence in hand, former American officials who follow Cuba closely have entertained a handful of theories that involve a third country, such as Russia \u2014 which would have an interest in driving a wedge between Cuba and the United States as the election approaches \u2014 or North Korea, which has en embassy in Havana. Neither scenario seems plausible without some level of Cuban government complicity, these officials say, considering how rigorously Cuba\u2019s intelligence service tracks diplomats on the island.The administration expelled two low-level Cuban diplomats in May in response to the illnesses, but with more diplomats and their spouses becoming ill, calls grew on Capitol Hill for a more forceful response.In the meantime, Mr. Trump in June announced he was \u201ccanceling the last administration\u2019s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,\u201d although the stricter travel and commercial regulations he ordered would fall well short of doing so, and have yet to materialize.Career American diplomats leaving Havana expressed regret on Tuesday that their missions were coming to an end.\u201cI am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,\u201d Scott Hamilton, the top American official in Cuba, wrote on Facebook. \u201cHasta la pr\u00f3xima, Cuba.\u201dGardiner Harris and Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Ernesto Londo\u00f1o from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter announced on Thursday that it would ban RT and Sputnik, the two Kremlin-backed international news outlets, from advertising on its platform, intensifying the battle over Russian propaganda on social media and prompting an immediate threat of retaliation from the Russian Foreign Ministry.The decision marks one of the most aggressive moves by an American social media company against the outlets, which United States intelligence officials have linked to a wide-ranging Kremlin effort, both covert and overt, to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Twitter\u2019s ban comes as United States authorities are pressuring RT, formerly known as Russia Today, to register as a foreign agent under a World War II-era law intended to curtail Nazi propaganda.Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, is now at the center of congressional investigations into the Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human \u201ctrolls\u201d and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government. But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively.But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitter\u2019s lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising. Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign.Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities\u2019 use of the platform to influence American politics praised the company\u2019s decision on Thursday \u2014 but cautioned that it would not be enough.\u201cI appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitter\u2019s most vocal critics on Capitol Hill. \u201cWhat I hope is we\u2019ll see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.\u201d\u201cTwitter\u2019s announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets \u2014 RT and Sputnik \u2014 from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute\u201d for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement.On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011. The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitter\u2019s decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform. Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human \u201ctrolls\u201d on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news.\u201cI think it\u2019s only a drop in the bucket,\u201d said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cWhat\u2019s far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputnik\u2019s ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesn\u2019t need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.\u201dMoreover, Twitter\u2019s decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter \u2014 and rival social media companies \u2014 treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms. Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda. China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV.\u201cThis is not about being a state-sponsored news organization,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

She was 32.On Monday, opening arguments began in the trial to determine whether Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, the man who killed Ms. Steinle as she walked with her father on a San Francisco pier, had meant to fire the gun.Mr. Zarate has acknowledged doing so, but says it was an accident. He\u2019s charged with second-degree murder.Jurors have been told to disregard the contentious national debates surrounding the case.Mr. Zarate, an immigrant from Mexico, had accrued multiple felonies. He had been deported five times since entering the United States as a youth.Yet less than three months before the shooting, a San Francisco jail released Mr. Zarate without alerting federal agents who wanted him for questioning.The San Francisco sheriff, Ross Mirkarimi, cited the city\u2019s sanctuary policies.After Ms. Steinle\u2019s death, that decision drew condemnation from political leaders in both parties. The sheriff was ousted in a re-election campaign.The debate over sanctuary policies has only intensified under the Trump administration and led California lawmakers to reassert the divide between the local police and federal authorities.A public defender countered that Mr. Zarate had found the weapon only moments before the killing and accidentally fired a bullet that ricocheted off the pavement before striking Ms. Steinle.Jim Steinle, Kate Steinle\u2019s father, was the first witness.Mr. Zarate\u2019s trial is expected to last at least four weeks.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)It may be autumn, but the heat isn\u2019t quitting.Temperature records fell like dominoes in Southern California on Monday.A sampling, according to National Weather Service figures:\u2014 Ramona, San Diego County, hit 101 degrees, up from a record of 97 in 2003\u2014 Downtown Los Angeles, 102 degrees, up from 98 in 1965\u2014 Riverside, 102 degrees, up from 101 in 1959\u2014 Santa Maria Airport, 102 degrees, up from 98 in 1965Tuesday could bring a new round of records.

{"Headline": "Working to Disarm Women\u2019s Anti-Aging Demon", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen TodayA couple of years ago I had a light bulb moment. So many women color their hair to cover the gray. Many resent the effort and expense, and it\u2019s a major way in which we make ourselves invisible as older women. When a group is invisible, so are the issues that affect it. Suppose the world saw how many we are, and how beautiful, I mused. Suppose we morphed together, in solidarity: the Year of Letting Our Hair Go Gray! It would be transformative!One thing we can all agree on, though? Aging is harder for women. We bear the brunt of the equation of beauty with youth and youth with power \u2014 the double-whammy of ageism and sexism. How do we cope? We splurge on anti-aging products. We fudge or lie about our age. We diet, we exercise, we get plumped and lifted and tucked.These can be very effective strategies, and I completely understand why so many of us engage in them. No judgment, I swear. But trying to pass for younger is like a gay person trying to pass for straight or a person of color for white. These behaviors are rooted in shame over something that shouldn\u2019t be shameful. And they give a pass to the underlying discrimination that makes them necessary.Appearance matters. Adornment pleases. But society\u2019s obsession with the way women look is less about beauty than about obedience to a punishing external standard \u2014 and power. When women compete to \u201cstay young,\u201d we collude in our own disempowerment. When we rank other women by age, we reinforce ageism, sexism, lookism and patriarchy. What else we can we all agree on? This is one bad bargain. It sets us up to fail. It pits us against one another. It\u2019s why the poorest of the poor, around the world, are old women of color.What\u2019s a girl to do? Join forces against ageism the way we mobilized against sexism in the 1960s and \u201870s. For movements to have power, their members have to embrace the thing that is stigmatized, whether it\u2019s being black, loving someone of the same sex, or growing old. That means moving from denying aging to accepting it, and even to embracing it.Some places to start:We have a choice: we can keep digging the hole deeper, or we can throw away the damn shovel. We can move, if we have the will and the desire and the vision, from competing to collaborating. We can turn it from a conversation about scarcity and loss to one about empowerment and equity. And we can take that change out into the world. The women\u2019s movement taught us to claim our power; a pro-aging movement will teach us to hold onto it.Ashton Applewhite is the author of \u201cThis Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism\u201d and a leading spokeswoman for a movement to mobilize against discrimination on the basis of age.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Small Firm in Germany Has Big Ambitions in Green Energy", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil and MoneyWILDPOLDSRIED, Germany \u2014 Like many German consumers, Christine Lacher, a nurse, and her husband, Reinhard, a factory supervisor, are careful when it comes to energy use. On a hillside here, they have built their dream house, insulated by clay walls with warm water piped through them. On the roof, they have installed solar water heaters and panels sufficient to generate enough power for their own needs, including charging their Nissan Leaf electric car, and still have some left over to sell to the power grid. \u201cI can say I produce my energy myself,\u201d Mr. Lacher said. \u201cIt is important for me.\u201dAlthough the Lachers have paid thousands of euros for all of their energy-saving and generating equipment, they say their investment will be worthwhile in the long run. They say that being more independent will buffer them from the stiff increases in electric bills that they and other consumers have come to expect from Germany\u2019s large utilities. They are also happy to have largely weaned themselves off electricity generated by nuclear power and fossil fuels like oil and gas. \u201cI can pride myself that I can save money, and it is good for the world,\u201d Mr. Lacher said.Sonnen has set up what it calls a community of around 10,000 households like the Lachers, who effectively obtain what electricity they still need from each other through the company\u2019s trading system. \u201cWhat they are offering is a real disrupter; you don\u2019t need big utilities anymore,\u201d said Paul-Josef Patt, chief executive of eCapital Entrepreneurial Partners, a German investment firm, which has invested 10 million euros (about $12 million) in the company. \u201cThey are a kind of energy Facebook.\u201dRenewables as power sources have characteristics that are quite different from the giant natural gas, coal and nuclear plants owned by the large utilities. Smaller and scattered around the country, renewable power installations, especially solar panels, tend to be owned by small investors like the Lachers rather than by big companies. Renewables also drive down the prices generators receive, helping to turn electricity into a low-margin commodity.Sonnen helps customers to reduce or even break their links with utilities. It provides customers with batteries and the controls to manage them. With one of these devices, which come in white steel cases up to six feet long, customers can store excess power generated by their solar panels during the day and then draw it down when needed.Sonnen also taps into some of its customers\u2019 batteries and makes the aggregated power available to the grid operators at times when the waxing and waning of flows from wind and solar creates a need. With the resulting income, the company is able to supply electricity to customers who pay the monthly fee.Analysts say that Sonnen has a reasonable chance to thrive in the electricity market of the future because it already has a substantial customer base for its battery systems, with the experience and feedback that brings. \u201cWhat they are building with their community offering is a natural extension of their business,\u201d said Damien Sauer, head of Europe for Greentech Capital Advisors, which advises on clean energy deals.Sonnen portrays itself as an insurgent. \u201cEveryone can connect with each other to share energy where and when it is needed,\u201d reads a statement on its website. \u201cThis will emancipate our world from the dependence on fossil fuels and anonymous energy corporations.\u201dSonnen has received backing from a major American corporation, GE, and venture funds. The company, which has a presence in the United States and Australia along with Europe, is growing fast. Last year revenue increased by two-thirds over the year before to \u20ac42 million. Sonnen says it is working with the authorities in Puerto Rico, where the power grid was heavily damaged by Hurricane Maria, to fill some of the gaps with what it calls microgrids based on batteries and solar panels.Sonnen does not make the batteries, but it says it winnows the market for the best available devices in terms of reliability and safety. Its headquarters houses a test lab, where, on a recent day Michael Geiger, the chief battery scientist, used a machine that mimics driving a nail into a battery to set off a loud explosion. Sonnen uses a lithium-iron-phosphate battery made by Sony that it says is much safer for home use than the typical batteries used in E.V.s and cellphones. Referring to problems with batteries catching fire on Boeing 787s, Christoph Ostermann, Sonnen\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want that to happen in the house.\u201dIn Germany, Sonnen is tapping into an ethos of energy independence enabled by the growth of renewables and other breakthroughs. One might not think of bucolic southern Bavaria as a technology hub, but here in Sonnen\u2019s home village, many of the 2,600 residents have invested \u20ac40 million over the years in a variety of energy technologies.The village produces about seven times the energy it consumes, selling the surplus to the power grid. Wind turbines spin on a nearby hillside, and many of the brightly painted houses are heated with cooling water from generators powered by methane gas produced from local cow manure. Some of the money earned goes to subsidize municipal activities like ski trips run by a sports club. In general, the village restricts these investments to local people, adding to their popularity with residents, said G\u00fcnther M\u00f6gele, the deputy mayor and energy coordinator. \u201cIf big companies had invested, I am sure they wouldn\u2019t like them,\u201d he said, referring to the giant wind turbines.Still, Wildpoldsried\u2019s energy ventures have drawn experts from companies like Siemens, the electrical equipment supplier, to experiment with the village\u2019s grid. The local interest in energy is also attractive to Sonnen, one of whose founders grew up nearby.Above all, Sonnen aspires to fill a need that has been created by the abundance of renewables: storing their excess power and saving it for an opportune time.Although the scale of the company\u2019s activities is relatively small, its leaders say it could become much larger. \u201cWe think we are just at the beginning of a megatrend,\u201d Mr. Ostermann said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grapes, Sour or Sweet, Are Ripe for Dessert", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe grapevine is one of the oldest plants in cultivation, and grapes are still the world\u2019s largest fruit crop. Much of it goes into the rich and various world of winemaking. But, for all my delight in drinking wine, here I\u2019m writing about the grapes that I use in the kitchen.Luckily, the characteristics that make wine so complex \u2014 they can be tart, sweet, fresh, earthy and fruity \u2014 also come into play when cooking and baking with grapes. There are times when the distinction between wine grapes and kitchen grapes is pleasantly blurred and a recipe calls for the use of both.Grapes don\u2019t continue to ripen once picked, so they stay as sour or as sweet as when they\u2019re harvested. Taste an unripe grape, and it will be mouth-puckeringly sour. Leave that same grape on the vine in the sun, and it will become incomparably sweet. The joy, though, is how much can be done with grapes in the kitchen at both ends of the spectrum, whether they\u2019re left whole or turned into juice or syrup to be bottled.With tissues in my pocket just in case, we drove out of town at dawn one morning, heading east to Musa\u2019s small farm. We arrived just as his zucchini flowers were opening up with the morning sun. At the base of the pot the flowers were to be cooked in, Musa placed layers of grape leaves, sliced tomatoes, fresh mint and parsley, some kaymak (a Turkish product similar to clotted cream) and a small bunch or two of unripe grapes. After baking, the sharpness released from the grapes had suffused everything with an irresistible contrast of tart and richness. I didn\u2019t cry, but, standing on the soil where grapevines have grown for so many centuries, I felt a real connection between food and place, history and memory. Grapes were a small part of this big dish, but their impact felt large and timeless.Back in my test kitchen in London, I\u2019m sadly not within reach of a plot of grapevines. I am, however, in possession of verjuice, an ingredient sold in specialty stores that is made from semi-ripe grapes. Verjuice allows me to experience the richness of unripe grapes in a bottled form. It\u2019s an ancient ingredient, used in the fruity, sweet-sour, spiced style of European cooking in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Later, when lemons, and then tomatoes, became available to add acidity to food, verjuice was rather knocked off the radar. It is now experiencing a revival in dressings and sauces, since it has the tartness of lemon juice and the acidity of vinegar without the sharpness of either.On the other end of the spectrum are grapes at their ripest and sweetest. As with unripe grapes, these can be used in the kitchen either whole, as they are, or else juiced or turned into syrup to be bottled.Grape syrup \u2014 pekmez \u2014 is another Turkish ingredient, a sweet molasseslike syrup made from cooking down juice from ripe grapes until it is thick and dark and wonderfully intense, like the date syrup I grew up on. As is common throughout Turkey and the Middle East, I like to drizzle pekmez on toast covered with a thick layer of tahini paste; it\u2019s much like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.Finally, there are uses for sweet, ripe grapes: bringing a pop of juicy freshness to a chicken salad, for example, or pushed into the top of an oil-enriched bread dough. This fruit-topped bread, schiacciata, is an absolute favorite of mine and very much part of my food memory bank. Eating it takes me straight back to family holidays in Italy, when we used to eat it for breakfast.Ripe grapes can be roasted to concentrate their flavor. Adding sweet wine and honey to the pan, as we do here to make a topping for ice cream, adds a caramelized dimension. Muscat wine tastes just the like the sweet and floral muscat grapes that produce it. Using it in a recipe with fresh grapes feels like ancient alchemy.I also like to perfume the grapes with sugar, vinegar and spices before they are roasted, chargrilled or oven-dried. Intensifying the grape\u2019s sweetness in this way turns them into the sweet-sharp flavor bombs they are, ready for their juice to burst and stain to form another permanent memory.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Any kind will do: Carolina rice, boiled and buttered; steamed jasmine rice; basmati rice in any guise; nutty brown, red or black rice; short-grained sticky rice. You can tempt me with a plate of Louisiana dirty rice, risotto, paella or biryani. I\u2019ll travel miles for fried rice, congee or coconut rice pudding.There are times when a simple pot of freshly cooked rice is the perfect accompaniment to a meal. On other occasions, a rice dish can be the main event. Pilaf (it goes by other names, like pilav, plov and pulao) falls into this category. Pilaf usually involves simmering rice with onions, aromatics and broth to amplify flavor and nutrients.Some types of pilaf are meant to escort a main course. They can be unadorned, or may have small additions of tomato, or a handful of orzo.In the cuisines of the Middle East, from Turkey to Afghanistan (and beyond to India and western China) pilaf-style rice and meat dishes are traditional and popular, especially for festive occasions. Usually, they\u2019re made from steamed long-grain rice studded with spices, meat or chicken.A pilaf I tasted in Istanbul inspired this particular one-pot meal. Essentially a fragrant lamb stew combined with basmati rice, it is not at all difficult to prepare. Though many pilafs are made entirely on the stovetop, my version is baked instead, once the lamb is nicely browned. Using the oven provides more-even heat for cooking the rice, and frees up your stovetop for other dishes.The best cuts to use are lamb shoulder and neck, both of which are succulent and juicy when cooked; leaner leg meat is apt to turn dry. Browning the meat and onions very well is important for building the flavor of the dish. Once this initial work is out of the way, all the dish requires from you is an (unattended) hour in the oven.Cinnamon, mace, allspice, cumin and coriander perfume the mixture. Golden raisins add sweetness, while chickpeas contribute a welcome flavor and texture, as well as additional protein. I prefer to cook my own chickpeas, and use their cooking liquid to moisten the rice. If you use canned, rinse them and use chicken broth instead.With a topping of buttery walnuts, fresh mint leaves and tart pomegranate seeds, this is a nuanced, harmonious, festive pilaf. Served with a dollop of thick yogurt, it makes a fine family dinner, but is special enough for company, too.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Intelligence Heads Warn That Russian Election Meddling Continues", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee delivered a stark warning on Wednesday to political candidates: Expect Russian operatives to remain active and determined to again try to sow chaos in elections next month and next year.\u201cThe Russian intelligence service is determined \u2014 clever \u2014 and I recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously,\u201d Mr. Burr said.\u201cYou can\u2019t walk away from this and believe that Russia\u2019s not currently active,\u201d he added.American intelligence agencies have concluded that Mr. Putin initially wanted to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, but later tried to explicitly help Donald J. Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign. The senators said they have reached no conclusion on whether anyone around Mr. Trump was part of that effort.\u201cThe issue of collusion is still open,\u201d Mr. Burr said.The news conference was the most extensive since the committee began its investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election early this year and the first time the senators have detailed so fully the trajectory of their secretive investigation and their sense of the stakes. Both men come from swing states where the presidential campaign was fought aggressively.That appeared to have made an impression.\u201cThere needs to be a more aggressive whole-of-government approach in terms of protecting our electoral system,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cRemember, to make a change even in a national election doesn\u2019t require penetration into 50 states.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou could pick two or three states in two or three jurisdictions and alter an election.\u201dThe Senate Intelligence Committee is one of three committees on Capitol Hill that have opened full-fledged investigations into the relationship between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. Given the committee\u2019s jurisdiction over the intelligence community and a strong working relationship between Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner, it has been considered the congressional committee most likely to deliver a substantive report on Russia\u2019s covert efforts.Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner sought to inspire confidence on Wednesday that the committee remained on course to do so. They later got a boost from Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he concurred with their statements based on his committee\u2019s work.\u201cThis feels like it\u2019s taking a long time. It is taking a long time,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cBut getting it right and getting all the facts is what we owe the American people.\u201dIn each case, Mr. Burr said the committee had interviewed all of the relevant witnesses and found no evidence of nefarious action.\u201cCampaign staff was attempting to implement what they believed to be guidance to be strong, to be a strong ally on Ukraine, but also leave the door open for better relations with Russia,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Mr. Burr was also unequivocal in saying that the integrity of the vote itself had been preserved, despite Russian attempts to test the vulnerabilities of 21 state election systems.\u201cWe can certifiably say that no vote totals were affected,\u201d Mr. Burr said, \u201cthat the tallies are accurate.\u201dHe also repeatedly steered away from criticizing Mr. Trump, who has questioned the validity of intelligence assessments about the election. Mr. Burr said any questions of criminal acts were best left to the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cThe committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who were your sources and sub-sources,\u201d Mr. Burr said. Without Mr. Steele\u2019s input, he continued, the committee had found it \u201cimpossible\u201d to rebuild the dossier beyond a certain date.The senators said that the committee itself would not release copies of the ads, but welcomed Facebook doing so if it so chooses as investigators continue to work to better understand the extent of the social media campaign.Mr. Warner said he was optimistic that the companies were \u201crecognizing that threat now.\u201d He said Americans and political candidates deserved to know who was funding advertisements and why individual posts were trending.Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As the World Tweets, Social Media Chiefs Remain Tight-Lipped", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorIf only Twitter, Facebook and Google could keep their stories straight.They thrive by mining the private information of the billions of people who use them, many of whom are na\u00efve about the value of what they are giving up with each post or click. But the companies are grudging at best when it comes to being open about themselves.Their tendency to show more reserve than the people whom they have encouraged to offer up bits of personal data has been especially striking in recent days.Last month, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg invoked \u201ctransparency\u201d when he took to Facebook Live to say the company would share more information about who buys political advertising on its platform. His vow followed Facebook\u2019s admission that it had allowed a shady Russian outfit close to the Kremlin to buy ads \u2014 in rubles! \u2014 that were apparently meant to divide the country and tilt the presidential election.With each repetition of the \u201ctransparency\u201d talk from the big social media platforms, more people begin to see right through it. I wonder if members of the House and Senate intelligence committees will do the same when the platforms\u2019 top executives testify at the upcoming hearings on Russians and the election, assuming they show up.Maybe the flaw in the social-media matrix lies in the whole concept of \u201ctransparency,\u201d anyway. The tech companies and their visionary founders have raised it as the cure-all for oppression and corruption \u2014 even as a path to personal enlightenment.The social-media overlords seem sincere when they describe their high-minded intentions. They talk much less, however, about the money they make from their users\u2019 relinquishment of privacy.The willingness of those who make daily use of Google and social media sites to offer up their likes and dislikes, not to mention the details of their spending habits and internet wanderings, provides Mr. Zuckerberg and his fellows with the personal data that is the holy grail of modern advertising. It also gives them an endless stream of free content to put those ads beside. Their users\u2019 endless posts, spats and vacation pics make for the ultimate reality show.Ms. Goodell\u2019s use of an online disguise suggests how hard it is to be yourself on social media, and the recent experience of the ESPN host Jemele Hill shows even more clearly the perils of mixing private and public personae on Twitter.Pointing up the new tension between journalists\u2019 speaking freely and being part of a team at a news organization like The Times, the White House correspondent Peter Baker noted that the Trump administration \u201cdoesn\u2019t make a distinction\u201d between his tweets and those of his colleagues who do not cover politics.In some cases, candor can seem too much for the platforms themselves. At least, that\u2019s what Ms. McGowan, who received a settlement from Mr. Weinstein in 1997 after she said he assaulted her, accused Twitter of last week.A Twitter spokesman didn\u2019t respond to my email asking if it had an answer to these critics, which is what I should have expected.Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, seemed to break from the social-media chiefs\u2019 habit of avoiding the press last week when she sat for an interview with Mike Allen of Axios, with which Facebook has brokered a deal for several exclusive interviews.

{"Headline": "Where Can You Park a Tiny Home?", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by17 PhotosDarryl Bray had hoped to park the 84-square-foot house that he built for himself in a secluded place, maybe on some spare acreage on a farm in Connecticut.But finding that kind of spot proved harder than expected, so instead Mr. Bray\u2019s tiny home on wheels sits in the parking lot of the light industrial complex where he works, outside of New Haven.Mr. Bray, 28, has lived behind the U-shaped complex for more than two years now, though not without hassle \u2014 even though the parking spot was offered to him by the complex\u2019s owner. He started out near a noisy auto shop that was attracting unwanted attention, but has since moved to a quieter space.The city zoning enforcement officer once put him on notice that he was violating various zoning codes. While no one has ever followed up, Mr. Bray lies low when he sees a police cruiser patrolling the complex. (For that reason, he asked that his precise location not be disclosed in this story.)\u201cI do fear coming out of my tiny house and having the police see me there,\u201d he said. \u201cI have blackout curtains on the windows, and I lock my door whenever I\u2019m in there.\u201dZoning regulations in most places \u2014 especially densely developed regions like the New York metro area \u2014 typically do not allow full-time living in temporary structures like R.V.s or movable tiny houses. Most tiny homes are built on wheeled trailers that can be towed. Unlike R.V.s, however, tiny houses are generally not wheeled for touring, so much as for flexibility of location.Zoning also commonly specifies a minimum home or lot size that is too large and expensive for a lifestyle geared toward affordability. Residential building codes can also present a problem for tiny houses built on foundations.\u201cA very small minority live in R.V. parks, though they usually have a limit on how long you can stay,\u201d he said. \u201cA friend or family\u2019s backyard, or land in the country, is much more common.\u201dBut with the tiny-living craze having lasted well past the fad stage, pressure is growing for municipalities to embrace tiny houses as legal residences. And more tiny-house building companies are popping up, anticipating just such a shift.\u201cIt\u2019s a spirit of cooperation,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple way to bring in affordable housing that doesn\u2019t cost the municipality anything.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a fear that people are going to end up living in shanty shacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that either. We want people to be safe in their houses, and in something they can afford.\u201dFor the time being, however, finding a place to live long-term in a tiny house requires creativity, flexibility and considerable networking.For Amy Garner and John McCarthy, it was a conversation over coffee with a well-connected architect that led them to the ideal location for their 340-square-foot tiny house in New Haven: waterside, at a marina on the Quinnipiac River.\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d said Ms. Garner, 30. \u201cYou wake up in the morning, and the sun reflects off the water, and you get this twinkle effect on the bedroom ceiling.\u201dThey have been there since April without issue, other than the occasional curious passers-by. And now they have a like-minded neighbor: A woman living in an Airstream, an aluminum-sided travel trailer, recently moved in behind them.Lisa Cohen and Richard Ratcliff, who met last spring while hiking the Appalachian Trail, are hoping for similar stability while they finish converting a school bus they bought on eBay into a tiny house. Finding a place to park it within reasonable commuting distance of Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, N.Y., where Ms. Cohen is a graduate student, was no easy feat.\u201cWe asked a few farms, a gardening center and a flea market,\u201d Ms. Cohen, 27, said in an email. \u201cEveryone was kind and said they would think it over, but then would either not answer calls or said \u2018no\u2019 in the end.\u201dEventually the couple found a restaurant owner in Dutchess County willing to let them park off to the side of his lot for $150 a month. (They asked that the restaurant not be identified.) Settled there for about a month now, they have access to electricity and well water. The train ride to Sarah Lawrence takes Ms. Cohen about 90 minutes, with three transfers, but she is appreciative of the spot, which she deemed preferable to \u201cending up in Walmart parking lots.\u201dBrianna Welch, 25, starts graduate school at the University of Vermont in January, and hopes to move from her Bronx apartment to the Burlington area in a 340-square-foot tiny house being built by Craft & Sprout. She and her husband, Chris Murphy, a 24-year-old software product manager, are actively hunting for land to rent, hoping to get settled before the first snow.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be through our network that we find someone who knows someone who has land,\u201d Ms. Welch said. \u201cWe knew this would be the hardest part, but I didn\u2019t think it would be this hard.\u201d\u201cPeople think they\u2019ll throw their house on a cheap piece of land and that\u2019s the end of it,\u201d said Mr. Porges, who lives in a regular house in a nearby town. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize all the logistical challenges they\u2019re going to face.\u201dHe wound up hiring an electrician to lay heavy-gauge extension cords connecting the tiny house to a power supply elsewhere on the farm. And he invested in hoses specially designed for potable water to run downhill to his house from a spigot. But come winter, he expects those hoses will freeze, once again necessitating the use of the water tanks.As for the dry-flush toilet, it functions as expected, essentially \u201cshrink-wrapping your waste,\u201d Mr. Porges said. But the disposable cartridges are fairly expensive: He calculates the cost at about $1 per flush. Other bathroom options for tiny homes include composting and incineration toilets.\u201cThe roots that we had planted felt more like shackles,\u201d said Ms. Richardson, 46. \u201cIt takes some courage to go against that societal template of life, but we decided we wanted to have more experiences and less things.\u201dAs they both are able to work remotely, their plan is to tow their house up to northern New England later this fall \u2013 although they haven\u2019t yet found a place to park it. While they\u2019re not entirely averse to living under the radar, they would prefer to find a town where they can live aboveboard, Ms. Richardson said.And if all else fails, they have a fallback: a year-round R.V. park they heard about in New Hampshire. \u201cThat\u2019s our last choice,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. \u201cBut if we have to, we will do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 91.Mr. Davis spent decades performing around the South at juke joints and house parties before a broader audience got a chance to hear his electrified rural blues in the 1980s.Mr. Davis was born Ellis CeDell Davis in Helena, Ark., on June 9, 1926, though some sources say it was 1927. His mother was known as a faith healer, and his father ran a juke joint. Although his mother thought the blues was devil\u2019s music, he took to the style early, starting on diddley-bow, a one-stringed instrument made by nailing a wire to a wall. He moved on to harmonica and guitar, often sneaking into juke joints to listen to music.He contracted polio when he was 10, leaving him with partly paralyzed arms and legs and requiring crutches to walk. But he was determined to stay with music. He told Mr. Palmer: \u201cI was right-handed, but I couldn\u2019t use my right hand, so I had to turn my guitar around. I play left-handed now. But I still needed something to slide with, and my mother had these knives, a set of silverware, and I kind of swiped one of them.\u201dThere he met some of the era\u2019s leading blues musicians and started appearing on two live blues radio shows on KFFA in Helena: \u201cKing Biscuit Time\u201d with Sonny Boy Williamson and \u201cBright Star Flour\u201d with Robert Nighthawk, a fellow slide guitarist. From 1953 to 1963, he and Mr. Nighthawk performed together, and they moved for a time to St. Louis.Mr. Davis was further disabled in 1957 when he was trampled after a brandished gun led to a stampede at an East St. Louis bar where he and Mr. Nighthawk were performing. Multiple leg fractures left him using a wheelchair.In \u201cBlues Back Home,\u201d Mr. Davis said, \u201cWhether I could walk or not, I had to make my place in this world, and find my own way, and I found it.\u201dHe continued, \u201cThe scraping of the knife along the strings of his bright yellow electric guitar makes a kind of metallic gnashing sound that conspires with his patched-together guitar amplifier and his utterly original playing technique to produce some of the grittiest music imaginable.\u201dMr. Palmer eventually brought Mr. Davis to the Mississippi label Fat Possum and produced his 1994 debut album, \u201cFeel Like Doin\u2019 Something Wrong.\u201dMick Jagger and Yoko Ono attended Mr. Davis\u2019s first gigs in New York City, in 1982.

She said she thought it was a pair of children wearing a cow costume charging up the block.\u201cBut it was stunning to me how fast it was moving,\u201d Ms. Schaap said. By the time it passed her, she realized it was a bull.\u201cThe most remarkable thing was that it stayed on the sidewalk,\u201d she said.After breaking into the park, the young bull seemed to grow sheepish (pardon us), slowing down to spend nearly an hour stock-still on the artificial grass of a sports field, staring back at dozens of gawkers who had gathered on the other side of a chain-link fence to watch.A high-speed chase it was not.The spectators were joined by thousands more online, after a live TV helicopter feed on ABC 7 showed the cow prancing around the park \u2014 and, spoiler, his eventual capture by the police.But it wasn\u2019t all utter nonsense.On his freedom run, the bull knocked over a stroller with a child, who was taken to an area hospital, according to the police.As unusual as the incident seemed, renegade cows and bulls have happened before in the city.The Brooklyn bull was eventually brought down by tranquilizer, administered at about 1 p.m., and led into a trailer about 30 minutes later, according to the police.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Get mooving, a fabulous fall day is ahead.Your morning commute looks nice, if nippy.

{"Headline": "Brutal Killing of Journalist Exposes \u2018Something Darker\u2019 in Malta", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVALLETTA, Malta \u2014 The blast from the bomb planted in the rented Peugeot of Malta\u2019s best-known investigative journalist was so powerful it took police investigators four days to collect body parts and wreckage scattered across sun-baked fields next to the road.Tracking down potential suspects with deep grudges against the victim, Daphne Caruana Galizia, however, will take far longer.\u201cIt is a very long list,\u201d Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, one of the journalist\u2019s many targets, said in an interview. \u201cShe was a very harsh critic of mine.\u201dThe list of people whom Ms. Caruana Galizia offended and infuriated as a prolific journalist in this tiny Mediterranean island nation includes many members of Mr. Muscat\u2019s ruling Labour Party as well as the leader of the center-right opposition. Also on the list: the president of Azerbaijan and his family, executives of a Chinese electrical equipment manufacturer, foreign drug barons, an Iranian-born banker and people active in offshore tax havens like Panama and the British Virgin Islands.All of them were the targets at one time or another of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s relentless probing of the underbelly of the European Union\u2019s smallest country, a nation that boasts Europe\u2019s fastest growing economy but has been hit by six car bombings in the past two years, all of them unsolved.How a country that has in many ways been so successful could be the scene of such a macabre and brutal murder on a picturesque road only a half-hour\u2019s drive from the capital, Valletta, has left many asking what went wrong.In the absence of hard evidence, Maltese are grasping at wild coincidences and conspiracy theories.Mr. Dalli was another regular target of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s writing \u2014 \u201cEverything she wrote about me was a lie,\u201d he said \u2014 and yet another well-connected insider who, despite detailed allegations of corruption, has never been prosecuted in Malta.Mr. Dalli, who in December filed a harassment complaint with the police against Ms. Caruana Galizia, said he \u201cwas very angry\u201d when he heard she had been killed. \u201cIt basically removed my chances of exculpating myself from everything she said about me,\u201d he said.Justin Borg-Barthet, a Maltese legal expert who lectures at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, said the legal system, built up during British colonial rule, has been so steadily eroded by political meddling and constant reshuffling of the police leadership that virtually nobody expects justice to be done in the case of the murdered journalist.\u201cTrust does not function as a reliable constitutional principle when people are untrustworthy,\u201d he said.The bombing stunned Malta, where known criminals sometimes attack one another but where the streets are safe and violence against public figures is extremely rare. It also sent tremors through the European Union, which took in Malta as a member in 2004 and, at a time of deep disillusionment with the \u201cEuropean project\u201d in Britain and elsewhere, has often pointed to Malta\u2019s economic success as an example of how Europe can work.\u201cSuch incidents bring to mind Putin\u2019s Russia, not the European Union,\u201d Sven Giegold, a prominent German member of the European Parliament, said of the killing. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, speaking to fellow European leaders at a summit meeting in Brussels on Thursday, expressed dismay and outrage at the killing.Before Monday\u2019s car bomb, Malta seemed to be enjoying a run of remarkable good luck, often thanks to the misfortune of other countries in the region. A banking crisis in Cyprus in 2013 helped lift Malta\u2019s own financial services industry as the island positioned itself as an alternative haven. (Pilatus Bank, set up in Malta in 2014 by an enigmatic Iranian, who is now a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, to serve wealthy private clients, was a frequent target of Ms. Caruana Galizia.)Malta also benefited from the turmoil unleashed in North Africa after the Arab Spring democracy movement, which prompted many European tourists to choose Maltese beaches over those in Tunisia, its old rival for tourist dollars. Nearly two million tourists visited Malta last year, a country with a population of about 430,000, compared with 1.1 million before the Arab Spring.Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union last year also helped advance Malta\u2019s efforts to promote itself as a safe, low-tax, English-speaking jurisdiction firmly inside the bloc. It has, for example, become Europe\u2019s main hub for online gambling.It has attracted yet more money by selling passports to wealthy foreigners ready to put up more than $1.5 million to buy citizenship. Authorities have refused to name the buyers or disclose their nationalities, but they reported last year that nearly 700 passports had been sold.Ms. Caruana Galizia frequently attacked the passport program as a license for corruption and an open invitation to wealthy and often shady foreigners to make Malta their home, or at least their hideaway.Malta, a British colony until 1964, became such an attractive destination for foreign money that a regional finance minister in Germany recently described it as the \u201cPanama of Europe,\u201d after German tax authorities were leaked the names of 70,000 foreign companies and individuals with holdings there.Since 2013, Malta has surpassed Cyprus as a banking center, relative to the size of its economy, with assets worth more than 500 percent of the island\u2019s gross domestic product, compared with 420 percent in Cyprus, the European Central Bank says.Christian Peregin, the founder of an online news site, Lovin Malta, and an admirer of the dead journalist, said the killing had exposed a reality that Ms. Caruana Galizia had spent decades trying to uncover, a mission that won her a long list of enemies and scores of libel suits.This split has in turn helped shape and harden a deep and often passionate political divide between the Labour Party, which Ms. Caruana Galizia loathed, and the Nationalist Party. She used to support the Nationalists until a new leader, Adrian Delia, took over. She described Mr. Delia as being in cahoots with criminals because of his previous work as a lawyer on behalf of Maltese clients, who she said ran a prostitution racket in London\u2019s Soho district.Mr. Delia was so angered by Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s articles, which included details of a secret offshore bank account he controlled, that he filed four complaints against her for defamation.He dropped the cases after the killing and is now trying to position himself as her defender, demanding that the prime minister, Mr. Muscat, resign and take \u201cpolitical responsibility\u201d for the car bomb.Malta, he said in an interview, is such a small, insular place that whenever villages hold celebrations \u201cthey have two separate feasts or two bands at the same feast,\u201d because half of the village is feuding with the other half for political or other reasons.\u201cWe have to fight not only corruption but our culture of hatred,\u201d he said.Ms. Caruana Galizia, whose family spoke English at home rather than Maltese, played into and helped fan this culture, sneering at rule-bending compatriots as \u201cSicilians\u201d and drawing the hostility of those who viewed her as the haughty representative of an Anglicized elite.Saviour Balzan, a veteran editor and longtime adversary, called her a \u201cspiteful snob\u201d who reveled in ridiculing people she viewed as inferior, particularly those who supported the Labour Party.She stirred such strong feelings that her killing prompted cheers in some quarters. Ramon Mifsud, a police officer whom she had portrayed in her blog as a drunken habitu\u00e9 of bars and lap dancing clubs, celebrated her killing with a post on his Facebook page: \u201cEveryone gets what they deserve, cow dung.\u201d Suspended from the police force, he quickly deleted the message.\u201cShe was certainly the best investigative journalist Malta has ever seen. However, she was at times also a tabloid trash writer, and did not always follow normal journalistic standards,\u201d Ken Mifsud Bonnici, a Maltese legal adviser to the European Commission in Brussels, said, speaking in a personal capacity. Nevertheless, he added: \u201cPeople do not get killed for publishing lies.\u201dThe Maltese news media reported that the bomb that killed Ms. Caruana Galizia was made from Semtex, the plastic explosive that brought down a Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Malta\u2019s previous car bombings involved more easily obtained explosives and targeted known criminals or their associates.The police commissioner, Lawrence Cutajar, the fifth person to hold Malta\u2019s top law enforcement job in just four years, declined at a news conference on Thursday to comment on the kind of explosive used. He was so evasive in his responses to questions that local journalists left the event convinced that the case, like previous car bombings, would never be solved \u2014 despite the presence of investigators from the F.B.I. and the Dutch police.With trust in the police so low, representatives of the island\u2019s main news outlets filed a petition with a court in Valletta demanding that any information found by investigators on Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s phone and computer relating to her sources be kept secret to protect their security.\u201cWhen a leading journalist \u2014 an institution \u2014 is killed and you don\u2019t have any faith in the justice system, everyone becomes a suspect,\u201d Mr. Peregin said. \u201cWe are all scared because we have no idea who killed her.\u201cIt could be anyone she has written about over the last 30 years, or it could be a message to the Maltese press or the government: Watch out for your neck and accept our demands or we will do worse.\u201dMr. Balzan, the managing editor of Malta Today, said that while he was a critic of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s work, he was appalled and frightened by her murder. \u201cWhat happened has taken us back to the Stone Age,\u201d he said. \u201cWho would want to work in journalism after this? Why should I go to work when people are asking: Who will be next?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Villains, Ourselves: A Thriller Roundup", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionIf our heroes disclose who we wish to be, our villains reveal what we fear we may become.Take an autopsy of the word: Villain derives from the Middle English villein, meaning \u201ca rustic, boor,\u201d a person of the lower classes with \u201cuncouth mind and manner.\u201d It\u2019s a pejorative etymology that illustrates not only how elites in the Middle Ages controlled history and language, but also the anxieties around those who were poor yet free, a state considered suspect. Thus, villeins were blamed for the evils disrupting an otherwise peaceful world.And so it has gone throughout history. To be human is to be afraid of the unknown \u2014 of the dark closets of our world, wherever they happen to be. Inside these closets, we have imagined a variety of gruesome things lurking, encapsulating our nightmares and giving a face to our terrors.For a while \u2014 starting with the \u201cEpic of Gilgamesh\u201d chiseled onto a tablet 4,000 years go \u2014 our villains were gods and monsters hiding out in the heavens and oceans, treating humans like their own personal set of Legos. With the rise of Christianity, Satan started to prowl folk tales and epic poems, luring us off the path to salvation. The Industrial Revolution led to a spate of high-ranking, power-hungry scoundrels like Inspector Javert and Dracula. The Victorian fascination with madness gave us an indelible squad of deranged harpies (Miss Havisham, Bertha Rochester, Lady Audley, to name a few). Two world wars, and all the best villains went global, scaling evil across continents, races, the future. The 1960s and Vietnam uprooted our institutions and questioned our freedoms, so we got Nurse Ratched, Catch-22s, Alex and a bunch of droogs. Then there was the Cold War, which hatched a flurry of thugs named Vlad who ruthlessly rolled their R\u2019s as they crept out from behind the Iron Curtain.We can trust villains to be our periodic mental health checkup. They tell us what we\u2019re losing sleep over, how we\u2019re feeling as a whole. Given the state of the world today \u2014 a bombastic political scene, the screen addictions and deluge of news, the conflict that has become our ambient sound \u2014 one would expect an uptick in psychotic cops, underground terrorist networks, tyrants with inexplicable hair and small hands.Instead, a dive into 2017\u2019s crop of thrillers reveals an even more disturbing kind of villain.Of course, this is a post-\u201cDa Vinci Code\u201d world in which no thriller can turn up with a single, white male expert (prone to the odd quip while staring down the end of civilization) without recalling Robert Langdon, he of the black turtlenecks and the knack for symbols. Thankfully, Richtel, a science and technology reporter for The New York Times, ignores this potential comparison and gets down to the nuts and bolts of his story, which he assembles with transcendentalist ease.We descend into the covert inner sanctum at Google X, where our nation\u2019s brightest geeks toil over secret projects within secret projects. We fly to Tanzania during a mysterious pandemic, wander a ski town-turned-ghost town and an unmarked bunker in the Nevada desert. Martin \u2014 and the reader \u2014 have little clue what is causing people to dissolve into a state of catatonia with fixed pupils and flailing limbs until we pick up on the anxiety running through Richtel\u2019s narrative like one of Trent Reznor\u2019s dark guitar chords: \u201cWasn\u2019t this what was happening everywhere? A new hyperskepticism, everything politicized, facts tossed out as partisan and any faith in humanity with it.\u201d\u201cWe can see that the pace of media, the onslaught of conflict-centric communications, stokes the flames of hostility.\u201d\u201cInstead of even trying to figure out what was right, people buried themselves in their devices. People talked to you while looking at their phones, lost in entirely different realities.\u201dA description of Google\u2019s influence sounds indistinguishable from the mysterious infectious diseases Dr. Martin treats: \u201cIt was insinuated in every facet of people\u2019s lives, from work and driving, music, television, every form of communications.\u201d From there the true culprit comes into focus. Though at first glance the solution appears to be only another mastermind who has commandeered technology for personal gain, Richtel leaves us with the more sinister suggestion that the true villain is us and there\u2019s nothing to be done about it. It\u2019s an illness we all have, and there is no cure. Most of us don\u2019t even know that we\u2019re sick.\u201cI can\u2019t tell which is the immune system anymore and which the disease \u2014 whether we\u2019re defending or attacking ourselves,\u201d Jackie, a Google employee whom Martin long ago rescued from death, admits.He might have been talking about the comments section on HuffPost.It comes to light that the mole is motivated by a desire to build \u201cone world\u201d \u2014 a single borderless country that brings to mind Facebook\u2019s hope to \u201cbring the world closer together.\u201d But infinitely more devastating than any double agent is the operating hollowness at the heart of the C.I.A. When superiors question Chang\u2019s loyalty, he submits to three polygraphs; however no lie detector can resolve the problem. Neither innocent nor guilty, he is afflicted by a lack of resolve: \u201cHe occupied a space where things are ambiguous, where people are simultaneously friend and foe, loyal and disloyal, impossible to define until the moment when events intervene and force each particle, each heart, to one side or the other.\u201d The agent is a spinning electron in the atom, eluding capture by a Heisenberg uncertainty principle. There is the probability of an exact location, which holds true only during the nanosecond of perception. Then he is at large again, careening around a moral fog.The Pact is a \u201cfellowship of like-minded individuals\u201d dedicated to ensuring the survival of that exotic, captive animal known as your marriage. It was founded by an Irish woman named Orla who, sequestered on a remote island, wrote a step-by-step system for matrimony, one that is \u201chighly effective, scientifically based.\u201d Pact members will act unilaterally to keep you and your spouse together and happy, no matter what.Few couples of sound mind would agree to such a proposal, particularly one that requires signing a contract filled with an \u201cimpenetrable veil of doublespeak and legalese.\u201d But Alice and Jake \u2014 apparently ascribing to the Trumpian life philosophy, \u201cShoot first and ask questions later\u201d \u2014 agree to Vivian\u2019s terms. They soon find themselves marooned in the guest houses of Pact members, following dinner parties replete with \u201can impressively large stack of profiteroles,\u201d where they chat with women who say things like: \u201cStupid mushrooms. Just when I had the yard looking so perfect, they popped up today.\u201dJake is pulled aside by another Pact member, an old college flame named JoAnne who is paranoid and skittish. She gets down to brass tacks: \u201cI would\u2019ve stopped it, Jake. I could\u2019ve saved you. Now it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs Jake gets shadowed by unmarked black Lexus S.U.V.s, receives mysterious packages and wakes up dazed aboard a Cessna with dried blood on his head, it becomes clear that the force of evil is only a matter of perspective. Like back at the C.I.A., there really are no good guys or bad guys here, only floundering players.Our protagonist is Matthias Glass \u2014 a washed-up writer who, after a well-received debut novel and a stint around New York\u2019s literary scene with a \u201clong-legged, pouty\u201d model (Swann has taken some liberties), returns to the prep school of his youth to solve a mystery that has dogged him since graduation. One night, after an argument, his best friend Fritz Davenport, old-money scion and golden boy, ran away from Matthias in the woods \u2014 and \u201coff the edge of the earth.\u201d He was never seen again.Swann takes his time setting up this mystery, with Matthias chasing down forgotten clues and overlooked conversations while being tested by the boys who sit in his class \u201cin a sort of numb acceptance, as if they were on Novocain.\u201d Swann does a wonderful job depicting these lost boys, the puzzling kinetics of friendship, competition and status, all of which feels out of date and menacing \u2014 the desire to \u201cconquer girls with all the rough ease of a 007,\u201d or how being labeled gay constituted \u201cthe worst, most devastating blow\u201d that left the accused \u201ccast into the outer darkness.\u201dBlackburne feels like an unmanned ship where anything could happen. Yet, when the villain is revealed, there is little move toward accountability, only continued silence and deceit. Evil is left to its own devices, out of reach. Matthias is shaken and powerless. He recalls Hamlet\u2019s letter to Ophelia as detailing a reality where everything should be questioned and nothing is true: \u201cDoubt thou the stars are fire, / Doubt that the sun doth move, / Doubt truth to be a liar, / But never doubt I love.\u201d It\u2019s the same moral haze Harris Chang and the other heroes got lost in, the only difference being a momentary comfort found in friendship.Molly with the capital M is the narrator, the original, true Molly, and Thompson does an excellent job dangling questions of authenticity and judgment before us like meat scraps before caged dogs. Is Molly the good one simply because she is the real Molly, the more advanced Molly? Do we root for her only because we are privy to her thoughts, and thus understand her better than we understand the mute monsters who come lurching out of the dark, the ones whose stories are unknown to us? The book exposes the arbitrary way we choose sides, perceiving a hero and villain through the murky lens of what is personal and understandable.The book works best as a metaphor. For most of us, our most pernicious villain is our self. To keep our higher selves thriving, we must do what Molly does daily \u2014 slay our lesser, reptilian selves, the ones who thrive on fear, ego, conflict. In this book, just as in the others, there is no grand confrontation, no ultimate obliteration of evil. There is only an exhausted d\u00e9tente, a passing of the baton from the killer to the killed. The villain becomes the hero.We are left with a portrait of villainy that feels, like the customer service number for an app, extremely hard to pin down. Villainy is no longer the fixed force of yesteryear. It has no face and no center; it\u2019s spread out across everything. It is confusing and exhausting. And it triumphs, time and again, for it causes heroes to throw up their hands and simply wander off mid-battle, numbed by the apparent futility of it all. If villains are a litmus test for our collective mental state, the prognosis isn\u2019t good. It seems these days we\u2019re not only uncertain of everything and everyone \u2014 foreigners, friends, institutions, experts, the people in our beds, the thoughts in our heads \u2014 we\u2019re also feeling too dazed to do anything about it. If this is the new, all-inclusive, everywhere darkness for 2017, where can evil go in 2018, and beyond?Maybe Cormac McCarthy was right when he wrote, \u201cKeep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.\u201dSo, pass the matches. It\u2019s going to be a long night.Marisha Pessl is the author of the novels \u201cNight Film\u201d and \u201cSpecial Topics in Calamity Physics.\u201d Her next book, \u201cNeverworld Wake,\u201d will be published in 2018.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Send a Journalist on a 52-Week Trot Around the Globe?", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery January, the Travel desk publishes \u201c52 Places to Go,\u201d a compilation of inviting destinations. This year, The Times is hiring a writer to bring the list to life, visiting a location per week in 2018.The world answered, and all at once, by the look of it. The job listing went viral on Twitter and Facebook, and to date The Times has received 5,700 submissions. Seasoned travel journalists have thrown their hats in, but so have teachers, flight attendants, a welder and at least one former Harlem Globetrotter. (The excitement extends to those who already work here: When a Times writer announced his intention to write about it, his editors suspected an ulterior motive.)The everybody-in-the-pool enthusiasm serves the spirit of \u201c52 Places,\u201d which has existed in its present form since 2014. Monica Drake, the editor of the Travel section, said her team had always meant to create a list that could appeal to the entire range between city-slicker cosmopolites and those who prefer to get off the grid. At first the public reaction induced a slight panic, Ms. Drake said, but the position captured the attention of so many people for a reason. \u201cIt inspires people to dream about how they would tackle the world,\u201d she said.Each year, the Travel desk begins putting \u201c52 Places\u201d together by soliciting ideas from both the Times journalists in the New York City office and Travel contributors based around the world. Over the course of a single meeting (some have lasted up to four hours), the editors select places that are well-rounded, meaning that they offer some combination of natural attractions, cultural points of interest and marquee local events. (Lest applicants see an opportunity to indulge particular fantasy trips: The list will have been decided by the time the anointed traveler comes aboard.)When she initially conceived of the \u201c52 Places\u201d job and worked with video, interactives, and masthead editors to develop its duties, Ms. Drake thought of it as a sort of \u201cgrown-up gap year,\u201d a reflection of the growing popularity, over the last few decades, of Wanderjahr-like jaunts. \u201cThis is the way that people travel now,\u201d Ms. Drake said. \u201cA lot of people work remotely, so they don\u2019t travel for weeks, but for months.\u201dBut applicant beware: The task will be no vacation. It\u2019s a given that the successful candidate will have to be an expert traveler, with the stamina to spend a full year navigating the world. Fluency in multiple forms of storytelling \u2014 words and images, but also more inventive means afforded by social media and interactive technology \u2014 is also a must. Ms. Drake\u2019s team has always approached the yearly lists as a sandbox to play with new storytelling techniques; the new job will push that creative spirit yet further.And forget about staying at the Ritz all year. The writer won\u2019t be staying exclusively at hostels, but accommodations will be location- and budget-appropriate. Such limitations serve a purpose: journalistic quality control in an environment where breezy relationships between travel bloggers and sponsoring brands are common \u2014 and difficult to see.\u201cIf you\u2019re reading somebody on Instagram, it\u2019s sort of hard to tell why they picked a certain place,\u201d Ms. Drake said. That perfectly composed shot may better represent the generosity of a hotel\u2019s public relations department than it does the average traveler\u2019s experience. A Times correspondent, however, cannot accept gifts in trade, so any destination featured will be on its merits alone, regardless of platform.Most important, the job is not to take exhaustive inventory, but rather to tell a coherent and comprehensive story of a place, even when things go wrong \u2014 a major challenge that affects how Ms. Drake reads applications. \u201cThere are some people who can technically do this job, but we want more than that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want someone compelling enough they can find a way to tell that story. It\u2019s kind of like casting.\u201d(There\u2019s even a small casting component: Finalists will have their screen presences evaluated in some manner, Ms. Drake said.)Ms. Drake hopes that by the end of 2018, the writer will have told a story of the world that others can see themselves in. \u201cHaving one person recount the experiences of all of them could make it seem like it\u2019s more within your reach,\u201d she said, adding what candidates might take as advice: \u201cMake it universal. You don\u2019t want to make it about you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is their first joint effort, and already a standout: While the menu is almost identical to those found at other Ethiopian restaurants, the flavors are brighter and the textures more distinct.The fermented teff at Benyam is loosened with water and cut with a touch of wheat (a concession to the difference in climate between Ethiopia and the United States). Then the batter is poured onto the hot face of a mitad, which in Ethiopia might be a flat clay plate warmed over coals, but here is a nonstick griddle plugged into the wall. The bread darkens in rings as tiny sinkholes multiply, the opening of a thousand eyes.The finished bread is sheer and papery at the circumference, curling up like parchment. The rest is sponge, with more loft and spring than I\u2019ve found elsewhere in town, while still nicely pliant. At the end of the meal \u2014 arguably the best part, when all that\u2019s left is injera soaked with the runoff of sauces \u2014 the bread still has structure and holds together.All dishes are arranged as ensembles, on a broad white plate nearly eclipsed by a full moon of injera. None exist in isolation; the flavors are meant to be interposed. Key sir, with sweet beets halfway between firm and tender, might neighbor gomen (relaxed, minerally collard greens), while deffen misir alicha, lentils collapsed into near-soup, might appear alongside fasolia, string beans guarding their crunch.Nubs of beef might be simmered with turmeric, ginger and garlic, to deliver a gentle, lulling warmth, or patted down with awaze, a paste of berbere swirled with tej (Ethiopian honey wine) and tossed swiftly in a pan, barely long enough to soften the edge of heat. For doro wat, drumsticks are left to loll in a stew of smoky-sweet berbere until they turn incarnadine, then are paired at the last minute with hard-boiled eggs, creamy and meaty at once.Dessert isn\u2019t historically part of Ethiopian culture, but Benyam offers two from local bakeries: baklava, flaky and not too sweet, and cheesecake with a sour-cream top, as old school and velvety as you could wish.Like most immigrant chefs, Ms. Girma has had to adapt. She can\u2019t always get the right shiro (chickpea stew) mix from Ethiopia, so she\u2019ll roast yellow split peas instead.

{"Headline": "Syrian Soldier Is Guilty of War Crime, a First in the 6-Year Conflict", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 For the first time, six years into a war that began with Syria\u2019s secret police accused of torturing teenagers and has escalated in brutality ever since, a member of the Syrian military has been convicted of a war crime.The perpetrator: a low-level soldier who is now in Sweden as a refugee. The crime: violating human dignity by posing with his boot on a corpse. The sentence: eight months in a Swedish prison.Anticlimactic? At first glance, yes, for those who want Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, and other senior officials tried for far more serious crimes like using chemical weapons, bombing hospitals, and detaining and torturing tens of thousands of people.Yet the ruling, issued last week in Sweden, is a landmark event, legal experts and human rights advocates say, the first conviction in any court of anyone from the Syrian government\u2019s side for crimes committed in the multisided war.As hopes fade for a political transition that could bring a full reckoning inside the country, Syrian and international advocates say there is new urgency to the search for other avenues to document and punish war crimes. In that context, they said, even this small victory is promising.\u201cThank you for justice,\u201d Rami Hamido, a lawyer who fled to Sweden from Syria and helped prosecutors build the case, said he told the judge after the ruling.The soldier, Mohammad Abdullah, 32, arrived three years ago in Sweden, where other Syrian refugees spotted him through his Facebook posts. They connected him to a photograph he had posted earlier, showing him standing over a pile of bloody bodies, smiling, with his boot on one corpse.At first, the prosecutor, Henrik Attorps, charged him with killing the people shown in the picture, but the court ruled that the picture did not prove he was the killer. So Mr. Attorps brought a second case, charging Mr. Abdullah with violating the dead man\u2019s dignity.\u201cThere is an international duty to act on these crimes,\u201d Mr. Attorps said in a telephone interview. \u201cSweden should not be a safe haven for war criminals.\u201dThe decision came just months after a setback for similar prosecution efforts in Spain. In July, a court there threw out a case that accused senior Syrian officials of war crimes in the death of a man whose sister spotted his corpse among photos of torture victims after a defector smuggled the images out of Syrian government prisons. A Spanish court had claimed jurisdiction in the case because the man\u2019s sister was a Spanish citizen, but a higher panel rejected that argument.Prosecutors in Sweden and Germany have made more progress using the same legal principle, called universal jurisdiction. It holds that national courts can have jurisdiction over certain war crimes that take place outside their territory.While Sweden focuses on cases that have a Swedish connection \u2014 a suspect, victim or witness in Sweden \u2014 Germany allows cases based on pure universal jurisdiction, with no national link required.Both countries have convicted several fighters from the Islamic State and Syrian rebel groups, which advocates say is a step toward accountability. But without efforts to prosecute those on the government side, it risks giving the impression that the European authorities are concerned only with suspected Islamic State members who could pose a terrorist threat, which could discourage potential witnesses.That such small steps are counted as victories is an indication of the difficulty of prosecution. Russia, the Syrian government\u2019s most powerful backer, has used its United Nations Security Council veto to block attempts by the United States and its allies to refer Syrian war crimes suspects to the International Criminal Court.And there are challenges even in the countries making the most efforts, Human Rights Watch reported. The group called for Sweden to expand its prosecution staff and conduct more outreach in Arabic to let refugees know they can file complaints, and noted that in Germany the authorities are struggling to sift through thousands of tips.Both countries are also carrying out broader investigations intended to document suspected crimes by Syria\u2019s military and prison systems, information that is not linked to specific cases but could provide context in some future, higher-level prosecution.As for the individual cases, Salma Kahale, a Syrian activist who works with families of torture and detention victims, said, \u201cFor now, I see this as mainly symbolic, a continuation of our cry in the wilderness.\u201dThe main value of the narrow, low-level cases in Europe, he said, is \u201cthe message it sends to both victims and their families and to regime officials that war criminals will not be able to get away with what they did, at least in Europe.\u201dHe said the prosecutions could also serve a political purpose. They could make it more difficult, he said, for Western countries to normalize relations with the Syrian government without at least trying to impose conditions such as releasing detainees and providing information on detainees who have disappeared.But at the same time, he said, it is important for the prosecutions themselves to avoid politicization that could harm their credibility.Advertisement"}

While juggling math assignments, they\u2019ll also tackle work sheets prepared by reporters from the national broadcaster RAI. And separate from the weekly hour of religion, they will receive a list of what amounts to a new set of Ten Commandments.Among them: Thou shalt not share unverified news; thou shall ask for sources and evidence; thou shall remember that the internet and social networks can be manipulated.The lessons are part of an extraordinary experiment by the Italian government, in cooperation with leading digital companies including Facebook, to train a generation of students steeped in social media how to recognize fake news and conspiracy theories online.\u201cFake news drips drops of poison into our daily web diet and we end up infected without even realizing it,\u201d said Laura Boldrini, the president of the Italian lower house of Parliament, who has spearheaded the project with the Italian Ministry of Education.\u201cIt\u2019s only right to give these kids the possibility to defend themselves from lies,\u201d said Ms. Boldrini, who is left-leaning but not affiliated with any political party. The initiative will be rolled out in 8,000 high schools across the country starting on Oct. 31.Italy, of course, is not alone in trying to find a way to grapple with the global proliferation of propaganda that has sown public confusion and undermined the credibility of powerful institutions.Pope Francis recently announced that he would dedicate his 2018 World Communications Day address to the topic of fake news, and the United States Congress is investigating how Russian agents manipulated Facebook and Twitter to spread false stories and stoke conspiracy theories to sway the 2016 presidential election.But ahead of crucial Italian elections early next year, the country has become an especially fertile ground for digital deceit. Frustrated by economic woes, upset by a migrant crisis and fed a steady diet of partisan media, many Italians subscribe to all kinds of conspiracy theories. It is what they call dietrologia, the belief that there is also always something dietro, or behind, the surface.The Italian passion for seeing intrigue \u2014 whether or not it exists \u2014 around every corner runs deep, said Alessandro Campi, a professor of political science at Perugia University. \u201cAll of this is part of the Italian cultural heritage,\u201d he said.A history of scheming Borgia cardinals, waves of foreign domination, papal crackdowns and corrupt governments had imbued Italians with an abiding distrust in authority, Mr. Campi said.\u201cIt\u2019s not only a tactic,\u201d Mr. Campi said of the movement, which has succeeded in attracting votes from the left and the right with an ideologically ambiguous form of populism. \u201cIt\u2019s their political worldview.\u201dNicola Biondo, a former chief of communications for the Five Star Movement, said that for the party, spreading conspiracies was akin to a policy.\u201cThey use the term Great Powers, never specifying who those powers are,\u201d said Mr. Biondo, who has recently written a book, \u201cSupernova: How Five Star Was Killed,\u201d with another party defector. \u201cIt is a mantra.\u201dMs. Boldrini, sponsor of the new student curriculum, asserts that the web cannot be forfeited to the fringes, and that the government must teach the next generation of Italian voters how to defend themselves against falsehoods and conspiracy theories designed to play on their fears.She said she had included Google and Facebook in the project in an acknowledgment that virtual space is where many young Italians live.Nevertheless, she expressed skepticism in particular about Facebook\u2019s commitment to reining in fake news and hate speech, and recognized the possibility that the Italian school project provided the embattled giant with a much-needed public relations boon.Facebook was quick to applaud the program. Laura Bononcini, chief of public policy for Facebook in Italy, Greece and Malta, said on Tuesday that \u201cthe program is part of an international effort. Education and media literacy are a crucial part of our effort to curb the spread of false news, and collaboration with schools is pivotal.\u201dMs. Boldrini also noted that Facebook was contributing by promoting the initiative through targeted ads to high-school-age users, and she said she hoped that the program, which aimed to show students how their \u201clikes\u201d were monetized and politicized, could become a \u201cpilot program\u201d for Facebook throughout Europe.But some of the Italian course load seems unrealistic. While some tips are useful, such as keeping an eye out for parody URLs, students are also called upon to reach out to experts to verify news stories, essentially asking the students to re-report articles.The program seeks to deputize students as fake-news hunters, showing them how to create their own blogs or social accounts to expose false stories and \u201cshowing how you uncovered it.\u201dIn Italy, that gives them a lot of ground to cover.For months here, conspiracy theorists who reject scientific consensus have connected vaccinations to medical conditions including autism in children, often blaming pharmaceutical companies as a dark force behind the medical practice. It was an issue that struck a nerve in Italy and played right into the wheelhouse of the Five Star Movement\u2019s distrust of expertise and authority.In May, amid a measles outbreak, Italy strengthened its vaccination requirements for school-age children, prompting so-called No-Vax activists to protest outside the Italian Parliament for the right to choose.His wildly popular blog has alleged that some vaccines \u201ccan kill,\u201d and websites, such as La Fucina, run by another party leader, Davide Casaleggio, have published anti-vaccine reports.\u201cIt\u2019s what the pharmaceutical companies do, and it\u2019s questionable,\u201d Paola Barile, 65, said as she stood with a Five Star Movement flag wrapped around her shoulders at a protest last week in front of Parliament. \u201cThe spell has been broken for us also on vaccines.\u201dAt the same rally, Five Star activists screamed \u201cshame\u201d and railed against the political parties, right and left, for joining forces to draft a new electoral law they considered (maybe correctly this time) designed to keep the movement out of power.But the Five Star Movement is not the only political force to have profited from fake news, and students are not the only ones who can be deceived by it.Last weekend, Gian Marco Centinaio, a senator from the Northern League, a right-leaning party, acknowledged that he had put on Facebook a post, subsequently shared 18,000 times, of a picture of a man identified as Ms. Boldrini\u2019s brother, and complained how the news programs \u201cdon\u2019t cover\u201d the man\u2019s no-show job that paid 47,000 euros, or more than $55,000, a month. The man in the image was not her brother, and none of the allegations were true.Mr. Centinaio called the post a joke and said, \u201cPeople should be less credulous.\u201dA healthy dose of skepticism is exactly what the new Italian program hopes students will adopt.\u201cIf people are prepared, educated on digital,\u201d Ms. Boldrini said, \u201cmaybe they don\u2019t fall for it.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

(The founder Jane Frances won an award for design excellence from the British Footwear Association.) Yet despite its rapid rise, the company remains dedicated to the concept of slow fashion. Each piece is handmade in Italy, and although the label introduces some new styles each season, the core of the business remains its collection of best sellers.For AYR, a label introduced in 2014, the concept of slow fashion is baked right into the name, which stands for \u201cAll Year Round.\u201d The company specializes in made-to-last basics in luxe materials. (Think: cashmere crew-necks, camel-hair robe coats.) Aloe jeans, its latest edition, are a mid-rise style made in Los Angeles from high-quality recycled cotton, and washed using just one cup of water (which, in turn, gets recycled to water the in-house laundry\u2019s garden!).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, Steve Bannon Should Terrify You", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRemember all the talk, before Steve Bannon was expectorated from the Trump administration, that he\u2019d be a worse menace on the outside than on the inside?Turns out it was true.But he\u2019s loud, obnoxious and a thorn in the side of the Republican establishment, and those are the real criteria to be a minion in Bannon\u2019s motley brigade. That picture of the two of them in Bannon\u2019s Washington townhouse \u2014 the Breitbart Embassy, it\u2019s called \u2014 was a declaration of Bannon\u2019s real intent, which is to inflict as much pain and ugliness on the G.O.P. as he can. He\u2019s not an ideologue. He\u2019s an arsonist. And he doesn\u2019t care who or what is reduced to ashes.What made Bannon so damned angry? I\u2019ve scoured the long profiles of him and devoured \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain,\u201d a biography of sorts by Joshua Green. I know about his father\u2019s stock-market losses and his own estrangement from dewier and more smoothly conformist classmates at Harvard\u2019s business school. Still I feel there\u2019s something we\u2019re missing, a sequence of belittlements beyond our view.Or maybe not. Maybe this nihilism of his was just his surest ticket to prominence and relevance, which he so obviously craves. No sooner was he out of the White House than he was on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d holding forth. He visibly swelled with self-satisfaction, as he did weeks later, down in Alabama, celebrating the insurgent Senate candidacy of Roy Moore.On a radio show that he once hosted, McDaniel mocked the idea of learning any Spanish by volunteering his own translations of \u201cmamacita.\u201d \u201cI think it basically means, \u2018Hey, hot mama,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cOr, you know, \u2018You\u2019re a fine-looking young thing.\u2019 \u201d He\u2019s a nasty-sounding old thing, which is another way of saying that he\u2019s catnip to the likes of Bannon.Other Republicans in the Senate who are up for re-election, on Bannon\u2019s hit list and in serious danger of defeat in their primaries include Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Their colleague Bob Corker of Tennessee pre-empted that kind of ordeal by deciding to retire at the end of this term, and Tennessee\u2019s Republican governor, Bill Haslam, resisted entreaties to enter the race and tussle with furious Bannonites.And so the G.O.P., hardly a paragon of sanity over recent years, is looking loonier than ever. \u201cThe formula is to be more aggressive, more outrageous, don\u2019t back down from crazy statements,\u201d one longtime Republican strategist told me. He\u2019s aghast at the fault lines that he sees opening, for instance between Republicans with an appropriate wariness toward Trump and those who demand unwavering fealty to him.For Democrats aiming to capture the Senate and House majorities, this is in one sense great news. Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes elections for The Cook Political Report, told me that \u201cRepublicans\u2019 two toughest Senate races \u2014 Nevada and Arizona \u2014 are winnable with the incumbents but are going to be very, very rough if the Bannon-backed candidates are the nominees.\u201dIn addition, Duffy said, \u201cYou look at Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi \u2014 nominating the wrong candidate could potentially put those races in play for Democrats.\u201dSo is Bannon miscalculating horribly and simply out of his gourd? No. He\u2019s not thinking in the conventional terms of Republicans versus Democrats; he\u2019s thinking that \u201cany disruption is a good thing, and that the best way to get what he wants \u2014 a white-centered, nationalist America \u2014 is to blow up the establishment,\u201d the Republican strategist said. Other Republican operatives concurred.If Bannon can bend the G.O.P. in its current form to that vision, great. If he can\u2019t, then he might as well destroy it to make room for something else. If Democrats grab the reins of power in the meantime, so be it. He\u2019ll sow and enjoy as much mayhem as he can along the way, and somehow deems that preferable to the status quo.Moore, McDaniel and Grimm aren\u2019t perfect ideological companions, but they\u2019re chaos candidates, and if they manage to get to Congress and the G.O.P. maintains its majorities there, heaven help us all. Just think about what they\u2019ll inject into the formal debate on Capitol Hill; just think about how much further they\u2019ll warp it. It could make the Tea Party\u2019s ascent in 2010 seem tame.No doubt Bannon loved it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kimbal Musk Wants to Feed America, Silicon Valley-Style", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEMPHIS \u2014 It\u2019s easy to understand why some people in this town of soul music and dry-rub ribs don\u2019t know what to make of the tall tech billionaire in a big white cowboy hat who has been opening restaurants and buying up hundreds of acres of land that used to grow cotton.Kimbal Musk, 45, got rich working in tech alongside his older brother, Elon. Now he wants to do for food what his brother has done for electric cars and space travel.\u201cThe Americana here gives me goose bumps,\u201d Mr. Musk, who grew up in South Africa, said during a visit to Memphis last spring. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Graceland twice. The community has been so welcoming, it\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201dMr. Musk is promoting a philosophy he calls \u201creal food,\u201d which nourishes the body, the farmer and the planet. It doesn\u2019t sound much different than what writers like Michael Pollan and everyone who has ever helped start a farmers\u2019 market or community garden have preached for years.But Mr. Musk has big ideas about what the Silicon Valley crowd likes to call the food space, which is as exciting to him as the internet was in 1995. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this kind of innovation around food,\u201d he said.In short, he wants to create a network of business, educational and agricultural ventures big enough to swing the nation\u2019s food system back to one based on healthy, local food grown on chemical-free farms.\u201cFood is this beautiful gift we give each other three times a day,\u201d he\u2019ll often tell a crowd, \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t design a worse food system than what we have.\u201dBut many people who have long labored on the front lines of the battle are still not quite sure what to make of him.For all his business and tech acumen, Mr. Musk can sometimes seem tone-deaf. At a conference on food waste in New York last month, he declared from the stage that \u201cfood is one of the final frontiers that technology hasn\u2019t tackled yet. If we do it well, it will mean good food for all.\u201dAlmost unwittingly, Mr. Musk has become a symbol of a growing divide between those raised on the modern American food movement \u2014 which gained traction in the 1970s and drove a revival in cooking, local products and food justice \u2014 and a new generation excited about cellular proteins, Soylent and app-based delivery services that are driven more by innovation than by pleasure.Gregarious, open and confident, Mr. Musk is a lot of fun to hang around with, a playful counterpart to his quirky, brilliant brother, with whom he remains very close.He wears a cowboy hat because he tried one at a store in Austin, Tex., a few years ago and decided it looked good on him. Never mind that people make fun of it behind his back. Criticism, whether focused on his looks or his philosophy, doesn\u2019t seem to bother him.\u201cMy way of working is very practical,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many wonderful solutions to real food, but I focus on what we can scale. The Slow Food guys were right, but what they didn\u2019t know was how to scale. If you can\u2019t scale, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cI noticed that when I cooked, my dad especially would make us all sit down and eat together,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved it.\u201dSoon after, he and Jen Lewin, his first wife, left for Colorado, where he met Mr. Matheson and opened The Kitchen in 2004. With its deep farm-to-table ethos and casually elegant style, the restaurant was an immediate hit.Both projects were running just fine without him, so Mr. Musk became chief executive of another tech company. Then, on a 2010 trip with his family in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he was sliding down a snowy hill on an inner tube when it flipped. He broke his neck and was temporarily paralyzed.During the two months he had to lie flat on his back, it became clear that he wanted to devote himself to food. He and his wife divorced; he quit the tech company and dedicated himself to changing the way Americans eat.Mr. Musk became interested in school gardens. He remains friendly with his ex-wife (the couple have two boys, and he has a daughter with another woman), and Ms. Lewin designed modular curved plastic planters that could be arranged in any schoolyard. Paired with instructions on how they can be used to teach subjects like science, the first gardens were installed in Denver schools in 2011.All the food is cooked from scratch. Menus feature wild salmon, burgers of local pasture-raised beef and big Greek salads with vegetables from nearby farms. Entree prices average $14, and the restaurants are designed so customers sit down together to eat and get their meals almost as soon as they order.The first opened six years ago next to The Kitchen in Boulder. In September, another opened in a huge urban renewal project in Memphis called Crosstown Concourse, an abandoned Sears distribution center that has been turned into apartments and shops, with a school, a health clinic and an arts center. The partners plan to add 50 more Next Door restaurants by the end of 2020.He is also testing the Kitchenette, a little takeout spot in Shelby Farms that sells locally grown, well-prepared meals for about $5 \u2014 his answer to a fast-food restaurant.He is not a fan of traditional school garden programs. \u201cThey don\u2019t scale at all,\u201d he said.There are other ways to ruffle the feathers of Alice Waters, the Bay Area chef who helped pioneer the American slow-food movement and the concept of the edible schoolyard, but criticizing her approach to local food and school gardens is near the top of the list.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear another word about scaling,\u201d Ms. Waters said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s very earnest about what he\u2019s doing, but he doesn\u2019t know enough about farming and about the soil. He wants to do the right thing, but he just hasn\u2019t done his homework. Not everything has to be scalable.\u201dMr. Musk says he is \u201cabsolutely in conflict\u201d with Ms. Waters. \u201cI love her, but I don\u2019t agree with her views.\u201d\u201cSomebody like Kimbal Musk could be an important bridge to bring some of these ideas together,\u201d Dr. Broad said.Maybe, Mr. Musk says. He is as much a believer in the power of technology as anyone in Silicon Valley. But he is a cook at heart.\u201cOptimizing for efficiency over everything else sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever eaten in Palo Alto?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The March on the Pentagon: An Oral History", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementThe Vietnam War is the only American conflict remembered as much for the opposition it sparked at home as for its battlefield victories and losses. Just two weeks after Marines landed at Da Nang in March 1965, crossing a new threshold of American military commitment in Vietnam, the University of Michigan held a \u201cteach-in\u201d for 3,500 students and faculty disturbed by the intervention. The next decade would experience an intensifying drumbeat of protests that were by turns intimate and gargantuan, educative and rowdy, radical and mainstream, and local and global in scale.The October 1967 March on the Pentagon \u2014 immortalized in \u201cThe Armies of the Night,\u201d Norman Mailer\u2019s \u201cnon-fiction novel\u201d \u2014 was at that point the largest antiwar rally ever staged. Coordinated by a coalition of antiwar groups known as the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (\u201cthe Mobe\u201d), it brought between 70,000 and 100,000 protesters to Washington to pressure President Johnson to end the war. One key organizer, Jerry Rubin, who with Abbie Hoffman would soon launch the mischievous Yippie party, helped give the event its countercultural cast. He announced beforehand a stunt by the poet Allen Ginsberg and others to \u201clevitate\u201d the Pentagon \u2014 provoking curiosity, mockery and (as intended) headlines.Most Americans didn\u2019t endorse the Mobe\u2019s demand for unconditional withdrawal. Though majorities faulted President Johnson\u2019s handling of the war, as many favored a decisive escalation as an immediate pull-out. In deference to the mainstream groups participating, Mobe leaders warned militant leftists against misbehavior and jettisoned radical speakers like H. Rap Brown of the (now inaptly named) Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, who had threatened to bring a bomb.What did it all achieve? News coverage suggested that antiwar activists had far to go in winning over the public. Commentary highlighted isolated acts of outlandishness, while conservatives focused on the presence of Communist groups. Though split about the wisdom of the war, Americans agreed overwhelmingly that, as one poll phrased it, peace marches amounted to \u201cacts of disloyalty against the boys in Vietnam.\u201d Still, in the near term, the march fueled the movement\u2019s energy and surging sense of power and hope. But it also framed antiwar opposition for many as a countercultural project and in so doing served to widen the chasm between hawks and doves.Recently, The Times asked more than 20 eyewitnesses \u2014 protesters, organizers, soldiers and reporters \u2014 to help tell the story of the march.Tens of thousands of protesters began arriving in Washington on Friday morning, some from as far away as California. Across the river at the Pentagon, the Army began activating its own forces in preparation for Saturday\u2019s march.Five chartered buses brought us to Washington. Aboard were some experienced activists, but most of the students were attending their first protest.I drove to Washington with Middlebury College classmates. We stayed with a student\u2019s family \u2014 fervent antiwar Democrats. I was amazed and impressed. Some \u201cold\u201d people hated the war, too!The Pentagon demonstration was preceded [on Friday] by a smaller one at the Justice Department, where participants pledged to support resistance to the war, and a collection of returned draft cards was turned in to the department. I had brought them from Boston, where they had been returned in a moving ceremony at the Arlington Street Church.A delegation of resisters and prominent older supporters, such as Dr. Benjamin Spock and the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, carried all the cards into the building and deposited them in the attorney general\u2019s office. For that, and for the church service, Spock, Coffin, Mitchell Goodman, Marc Raskin and I were indicted 10 weeks later in Boston federal court for conspiracy to aid, abet and counsel young men to violate the draft law.I had been an infantry platoon leader in the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the first Army ground combat unit deployed to Vietnam in 1965. I was wounded in action late that year and in the same battle lost many men, including two dear friends from West Point. So two years later I was not very pleased to see what seemed to be complete disrespect for their lives and service playing out around the Pentagon.I wouldn\u2019t have been in Washington that weekend, or any other weekend, but: I was stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C. Friday afternoons for a few dollars Marines who had cars would take riders where they were going. It was called \u201cswooping,\u201d and D.C. was a popular destination. We were warned \u2014 ordered \u2014 not to go near the march because there might be trouble with the protesters. But I decided to along anyway, to see what it was all about.I am a female. I am black. I traveled to D.C. with a bus of veterans against the war. I think this was a difficult time for a black person to join this movement. Some would view it as abandoning the civil rights cause to become part of another cause. There was still a draft and many blacks had family members or friends in the war. This was personal for so many whose family progress was dependent upon military benefits and history. Though not the case in my experience, I felt their pain and the cost of non-allegiance to such an emotional cause. Nonetheless, I was eager to take a stand against what I perceived as illegal and immoral.During our late-night drive from Cambridge, Mass., to Washington, around 3 a.m. I looked out the window of our bus. What I saw then still forms a vivid picture in my mind. Behind us and ahead of us I saw bus after bus heading south through the darkness. They were going to Washington for the same reason I was.WASHINGTON D.C.White HouseVIRGINIAState DepartmentLincoln MemorialTHE NATIONAL MALLARLINGTONMEMORIAL BRIDGEReflecting PoolTidal BasinRoute of the marchOct. 21ARLINGTON NATIONALCEMETERYNorth parking lotMall entranceJeffersonDavis Hwy.PentagonPotomac River1/2 MileWhite HouseWASHINGTON D.C.StateDepartmentLincoln MemorialTHE NATIONAL MALLARLINGTONMEMORIAL BRIDGEReflecting PoolTidal BasinRoute of the marchOct. 21Potomac RiverARLINGTONNATIONALCEMETERYNorth parking lotMall entranceJeffersonDavis Hwy.Pentagon1/2 MileThe first event of the day was a rally at the Lincoln Memorial, with a lectern set in the same spot where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others had spoken during the March on Washington four years earlier. Meanwhile, soldiers, Defense Department civilians and reporters gathered across the river and waited to see if the tens of thousands of people massed on the Mall would in fact march on the Pentagon.I slept on my friend\u2019s couch Friday night, and rose early to run. As I ran, I witnessed the morning preparations of both the march organizers and the government defenders. I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw. It looked like prep for battle. Armed soldiers were building barricades, filling sandbags, raising fences, digging trenches, rolling out communication wire, positioning troops. Armored vehicles were everywhere.Four of us drove to the rally all night long from Gerald Ford\u2019s conservative city of Grand Rapids in a peach-colored VW Beetle on loan from a favorite college professor. We wolfed down coffee and doughnuts and headed straight to the Lincoln Memorial. We joined a large group of good people: parents with young children, disabled vets and a very special 80-year-old woman wearing high silver boots.As I rounded the hill beneath the Washington Monument, the breathtaking view before me brought to mind the exodus scene from Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s \u201cThe Ten Commandments.\u201d Even wide-screen Panavision couldn\u2019t capture this massive expanse of humanity, stretched as far as I could see.Jack WalkerMy friend Jeannie and I arrived at the Washington Monument and wandered west along the reflecting pool. The streets were closed off and helmeted police clustered near vehicles with flashing lights, visible but out of the way. A tall, naked man was wading in the pool, waving a big American flag, trailed by skinny, hooting boys.The press parking area behind the Pentagon that morning was nearly deserted, presided over by a dour Air Force major who examined my news media credentials and directed me to the press office entrance on the other side of the huge five-sided building. He denied my request to shortcut through the building. I would have to walk all the way around. This enabled me to see squads of helmeted, rifle-toting military policeman moving into positions around the building. To my untrained eye it looked like the Army was overdoing it, erring on the side of caution with all these troops. Most looked anxious and younger than me.The formal portion of the day began at 11 a.m. with music by Peter, Paul and Mary and Phil Ochs, and speeches from organizer David Dellinger, Spock, the comedian Dick Gregory and others.Jack WalkerWe found a spot near the Lincoln Memorial and sat, listening to the music and trying to follow the speeches. The snatches I heard were full of thunder against the government.Jane OphoffWe chanted \u201cHell, no; we won\u2019t go.\u201d I had a piccolo in my pocket and led a group who followed me as I played \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home Again.\u201dWhen a member of the British Labour Party took the stage to announce his opposition to the war, members of the American Nazi Party rushed the stage and turned over the lectern.Don BergesI walked down the long stretch of the Pentagon\u2019s broad ceremonial entrance stairs toward its vista of the Potomac River and the Memorial Bridge. Beyond was the Lincoln Memorial and the Mall. From that distance, I couldn\u2019t see how many people were gathered at the feet of the Great Emancipator. The day\u2019s big story would probably be coverage of fiery speeches over there and the whole Pentagon angle would turn out to be a waste of time.As the speeches wound down after 1:30, people in the crowd began to watch for signs of movement toward the Memorial Bridge, which would take them to the Pentagon. They didn\u2019t have to wait long.Jack WalkerA trumpet blew and the crowd began to drift toward the Potomac. Press photographers rushed to get ahead of the flow, and antiwar banners and signs sprouted up. Some people started chanting. It had become a political parade.Bill ZimmermanAnother large contingent soon moved toward the bridge holding aloft several 25-foot banners and a host of colorful signs. They were veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Americans who had volunteered to fight fascism during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. As these aging heroes passed, thousands first cheered and then joined them, eager to pick up the torch they had carried. Soon the march stretched all the way from the Memorial to the Pentagon, 50,000 people.James AndersonIt was a pleasant fall day, a good day for a short walk in the company of friends. We formed a very earnest group, mostly young, mostly students, all committed.Helicopters, already as much the icon of the Vietnam War as jeeps and Sherman tanks had been for the Second World War, whop-whop-whopped overhead, doubtless keeping close tabs for the authorities on the progress of the march, while reminding us of why we were there.At some point, the police blocked us from marching toward our preferred route. In response we sat down on the bridge, tens of thousands of us as far as you could see, forcing the government to yield.Bill ZimmermanThere was no plan about what to do when we got to the building. Some wanted to simply stand in silent protest and defiance. Others were determined to get inside and ransack it. A few planned to deface its outer walls. The more whimsical spoke of \u201clevitating\u201d the building and \u201cexorcising\u201d the evil spirits inside.Don BergesAfter an hour or so of hanging around exchanging wisecracks with other reporters, I walked back north for another view at the story that was probably unfolding without me across the river. I was brought up short by what I saw. Advancing slowly toward me was a broad deep wave of people, tens of thousands of people tightly packed the full length and breadth of both sides of the approach highways and back across the bridge.Though the march was not an official part of the day, its details had been painstakingly negotiated between organizers and the Pentagon. The marchers asked to be allowed to encircle the building; they were refused, and told they had to stay in the North Parking Lot, several hundred feet from the Pentagon and across the Jefferson Davis Highway.Maurice IssermanFinally, we reached the Pentagon, or that is to say, an adjoining parking lot. Here was where the officially choreographed \u201cresistance\u201d was supposed to take place. Protesters would have the option of crossing a police line, and then submitting to arrest in orderly fashion.\u00a0Everyone else would content themselves staying within shouting (or levitating) distance.Joanne Seay ByrdThe Pentagon area was amazing. To my young mind there was a massive crowd chanting and marching.Don BergesSome were of an older generation, neatly dressed and smiling, advancing arm in arm with new friends, content and secure in their beliefs, occasionally chanting in unison polite slogans urging an immediate end to the conflict. Others were young, loud and angry; a few wielded crude signs with words so profane I would not dare repeat on the air.By 4 p.m. the bulk of the marchers had arrived. Between them and the building stood a line of military police, and behind them federal marshals. Several prominent marchers mounted a flatbed truck and gave speeches. Off to the sides were temporary chain-link fences. Almost immediately, tensions among the crowd began to rise.Noam ChomskyI was with a group of somewhat older people, suits and ties. While gathering near the Pentagon, facing a line of soldiers, we took turns with the mike.Standing on a flatbed [press] truck positioned near Corridor 7 at the Pentagon\u2019s mall entrance, microphone attached to my two-way, I looked out over a vast sea of people. Helmeted military police, bayonets affixed to their rifles, and federal marshals faced thousands of protesters.I was allowed to walk up to the roof and move to the flat part over the main entrance where the protest march ended. There were a number of snipers on the roof along with a few civilians whom I assumed were F.B.I., since they were using binoculars to search the crowd and identify known \u201csubversives.\u201d I heard them call out a few names, so they did locate some people of interest to their group.Bill RamseyA young woman plucked a flower from her hair and stepped forward, placing it in the barrel of a soldier\u2019s rifle. I heard the click of a camera\u2019s shutter. The young soldier looked confused, his eyes riveted on the flower. His face seemed to mirror the same fear that I felt. I wondered, did he also feel trapped?Sharon SmithI was saddened, though not surprised, to come face-to-face with weapons-toting military men. Some girls pushed daisies into their rifle barrels. I wondered if the soldiers wished they could fire on us, or secretly applauded our efforts to protect them from being sent off to die for a bunch of greedy rich old men.Bill RamseySeveral demonstrators, apparently expecting what was to come and having arrived prepared, put on football helmets.Don BergesEvery so often a demonstrator wormed past the line of soldiers and ran in arm-waving triumph toward the building until roughly tackled and hauled off by the authorities.Paul Millman, a Students for a Democratic Society activist I knew, somehow got hold of a bullhorn and began a monologue of remarkable gentleness and persuasiveness. They were pleas to the Gis to recognize the immoral and futile nature of the war, to lay down their rifles and join us. After Paul went on like this for fifteen minutes or so, a small miracle of resistance occurred. I saw one soldier put down his weapon and his helmet and actually walk into the welcoming crowd. Then a second man did the same \u2014 or I think he did. We all wanted so badly for such a mutiny to occur that we interpreted any movement by a G.I., any anxious shuffling of feet or replacement of one man in line by another as a giant step toward pulling the United States out of Indochina and stoking the fires of revolt at home.Leslie H. GelbNo one in the building that day had much, if any, sympathy for the protesters, especially those waving Viet Cong flags. It was one thing to be against the war and another to wave those flags.As the crowd gathered, several hundred protesters, led by Allen Ginsberg, Abbie Hoffman and the Fugs, a politically oriented band from New York, attempted to \u201clevitate\u201d the Pentagon. Through a sound system mounted on a truck, the band and Ginsberg led the crowd in an elaborate chant.Nancy KurshanEd Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg of the Fugs, decked out in multicolored capes, provided the music. Ginsberg opened the ceremony with what would become his hallmark \u201cOmmmmmmmmm.\u201d Others led incantations of \u201cOut, demons, out!\u201dJames AndersonNothing happened to the Pentagon, not even a twitch. Not many demonstrators paid attention. However, the planned exorcism, the visual image and its overall weirdness played well in the press. Some justified their use by claiming the absurdity of the war should be matched by the absurdity of matching actions. Unfortunately, absurdity also provided a good argument for those hostile to the demonstration to dismiss, ignore and discourage the participation of serious people with serious criticisms of bad government policy.By 5 p.m., the crowd\u2019s joy at having reached the Pentagon was fading, replaced by fear among some and a determination among others to instigate a confrontation. The situation grew confused; a number of tear gas grenades were set off, reportedly by accident, while a contingent of protesters tried to make an end run around the soldiers and marshals toward the Pentagon. Federal marshals began arresting people, including Mailer and Chomsky.Jane OphoffIt was clear that we had reached an impasse between a teach-in and a standoff.Joanne Seay ByrdAll was good until the first bayonet I had ever seen was wielded by a guardsman poised to deflect our advancement to the Pentagon wall.Noam ChomskyI happened to be speaking when the soldiers suddenly put on gas masks and started advancing forward to clear the crowd. Everyone sat down. Not knowing what to do, I kept talking \u2014 to the strangest-looking audience I\u2019ve ever faced. Marshals took or dragged everyone to waiting vans. My audience of gas masks passed by me and I kept talking to a wall of the Pentagon, which I\u2019m sure was most responsive. Until my turn came.Joanne Seay ByrdPeople began to scatter. Contact was lost between friends and groups.Jane OphoffThe great majority realized that it was time to disperse just as a radical element of protesters revealed their intentions, broke through barriers and ran toward the Pentagon.Bill ZimmermanAs they turned toward the building, they encountered the first of two temporary fences. They immediately tore down part of it, which separated the parking lot from the grounds of the Pentagon itself. Marshals rushed over and forced them back.Maurice IssermanA few dozen protesters charged up the hillside and the steps, actually making it into the building before being beaten back. Hundreds, then thousands, followed in their steps.Don BergesI had just picked up the phone in the press room and dialed a station in Florida when there was a big uproar outside. Loud noises came from objects hurled against the building\u2019s doors and walls. Guards struggled to secure the big doors against a bellowing offshoot of the crowd trying to charge through the entrance.Maurice IssermanI thought about what I should do for a few seconds until, saying goodbye to my uncle and aunt, I loped up the hillside after the others. By the time I reached the beachhead before the Pentagon steps, the opening behind me had been sealed. For better or worse, I was committed.For the next two hours, the crowd battled with the military and marshals, until most of the fencing had been torn down. Soon the crowd, by then about 20,000 people, was within 30 yards of the Pentagon, face to face with a line of bayonet-wielding military police.Bill ZimmermanWe sat down by the thousands on the grass or pavement directly in front of them. I was in the first row, and like others, I talked to the soldiers immediately opposite me about the war and why we were there to protest it. Some of the young soldiers were hostile, but many were ill at ease, unaccustomed to what they were experiencing and ambivalent about those of us confronting them.Sharon SmithI sang along to \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d It felt glorious to be part of a massive, peaceful gathering of like-minded folks. The chant started: \u201cHell, no. We won\u2019t go!\u201d I joined in \u2014 but realized no one was asking me to go.\u00a0Back then, there were no female-inclusive anti-war chants. OK, we weren\u2019t being drafted; but we girls and women were protesting the senseless potential loss of our friends, husbands, brothers, cousins and sons.Maurice Isserman\u201cIt is difficult to report publicly the ugly and vulgar provocation of many of the militants,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 James Reston wrote about what happened next, in a front-page think piece for the newspaper two days later. \u201cThey spat on some of the soldiers in the front line at the Pentagon and goaded them with the most vicious personal slander.\u201d That\u2019s not the way I remember it, and interestingly, it\u2019s not the way that The Times\u2019 reporters who were actually on the scene on Oct. 21 reported it \u2014 there is no mention of spitting in either The Times\u2019 or The Washington Post\u2019s news stories on Oct. 22.Bill ZimmermanA short distance to my right protesters stood up and moved closer to the troops. M.P.s emerged from behind the paratroopers. Their rifles had no bayonets but were held at their waists pointed up at an angle, directly at the heads of the demonstrators standing face to face in front of them. No one backed off.Don BergesThe atmosphere was rapidly metastasizing into one of potential violence. No doubt I wasn\u2019t the only one who held my breath when a young man among the protesters took a half-step forward, improbably produced a flower and inserted its stem into the barrel of a rifle pointed at him.Bill ZimmermanCalmly, he moved down the line of M.P.s and put each of his flowers into a different rifle barrel. This symbolic act was caught on film and the resulting photo splashed across front pages throughout the country the next day.As evening set in, many in the crowd began to peel off, either from fatigue, fear of further clashes or both. Meanwhile, the hundreds of arrestees were taken to an impromptu processing center behind the Pentagon. Some were released; others, including Mailer and Chomsky, were sent to the jail in Occoquan, Va. At 10:30, the military police on the front line were replaced by soldiers from nearby Fort Meyer.Bill RamseyWith the standoff uncertain but feeling clearly unsafe, I \u201cjumped ship.\u201d Actually, I jumped a wall by the landing\u2019s side stairs and headed up the embankment to the southbound highway. Relieved to be out of the fray, I stuck out my thumb. A red sports car stopped, and the young driver asked me where I was headed. When I said \u201cHigh Point, North Carolina,\u201d he responded, \u201cI\u2019m headed back to Camp Lejeune \u2014 get in.\u201d Knowing Camp Lejeune to be a Marine base near the North Carolina coast, I warily lowered myself into the passenger seat. He asked, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d With not much more than a murmur, I answered, \u201cThe Pentagon.\u201d And he said, \u201cThanks. I was there, too.\u201d He told me that he was expecting orders to be deployed to Vietnam any day and that this was his first, and maybe last, chance to speak out.Nancy KurshanAs the sun went down, it became cooler and cooler. The crowd was getting younger and younger. We were on our own. The protection of the older generation was disappearing.George KirbyIt seemed like a couple hundred buses were waiting to pick the demonstrators up right next to the Pentagon. I\u2019d spoken to three coeds earlier. I walked near them as they searched for their bus. One looked at my short hair and neat civilian shirt and asked, \u201cAre you in the service?\u201d I replied in my best military manner, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I just got back from Nam. I\u2019m what you are demonstrating against.\u201d The girl replied, \u201cWe\u2019re not against you. Marines have really cool uniforms.\u201d And they hurried off to find their bus.Jane OphoffLike most others, we were committed to nonviolence, left the scene immediately and found a cheap motel room, where 10 of us packed in with the sleeping bags we had brought. In the morning we would find out that our peaceful rally and march had devolved into an overnight clash during which hundreds were arrested.Bill ZimmermanWe made bonfires with the picket signs carried earlier. Impromptu speakers used bullhorns to urge the paratroopers to switch sides. We wanted our soldiers to abandon the government and join us, as Russian soldiers had in 1917. Around 9 p.m., one did. A single trooper dropped his rifle, threw down his helmet and advanced into the crowd of protesters. Before he got far, he was seized from behind and led away. We never found out what happened to him.Nancy KurshanWe were on a mission and we knew we were right. We looked to the right and we looked to the left and we knew that all of us would remain up until the point of arrest. For hours there was an impromptu teach-in to the troops. People climbed up on a ledge and, using a bullhorn, spoke to the troops. There was an open mike (well, actually a bullhorn) for anyone who wanted to speak. I did not have the confidence to speak, but I was very proud of what people said.Noam ChomskyMost of those arrested were young, uncertain, tense. The emotional pitch was high [in the jail in Occoquan]. There were some calls for actions that could have caused major problems. Mailer intervened quietly, decisively, with a touch of low-keyed and effective mockery, helping to restore a mood of serious dedication and to avert self-destructive militancy, an intervention of no small significance.My unit did not move to the Pentagon until 10:30 p.m. We were not issued ammunition, but it was kept a short distance away. The troops were issued gas grenades. This gave me some anxious moments. Demonstrators could easily grab grenades off the soldiers\u2019 web gear. In fact that happened to troops from other units earlier in the day.Bill ZimmermanSoon, I saw draft cards being burned. Many young men in the crowd had not yet taken that step. In the eerie scene, with bonfires encircling the Pentagon, they found the inspiration to do so. Over 200 draft cards went up in smoke.Bob GregsonTwo things struck me most during that long chilly night as we stood, shoulder to shoulder, with unloaded rifles facing the crowd. First was the hostility of a very few demonstrators. One young man in particular spent the night putting his face within inches of the faces of our soldiers and staring at them, seemingly ready to spit in their faces. Second, our guys couldn\u2019t respond verbally or physically, so it was very hard on each of them in turn. I was terribly proud of their self-control. After all, most of our men were draftees and perhaps had varying levels of sympathy for the protesters, but that man\u2019s actions drew a lot of curses later on. My first sergeant \u2014 also an injured Vietnam combat vet \u2014 became enraged by that young man\u2019s conduct and tried to jam his rifle under our troops\u2019 legs from behind the perimeter to hit the shoes of that man. But the young guy simply hopped left or right and continued his mental and physical harassment.Nancy KurshanThe soldiers would every now and then make forays into the front of the crowd, clubbing a few people and dragging a few others away to be arrested. We sat, arms locked as tight as possible, to impede them as much as possible and to protect one another. In the end they dragged away everyone who remained. Well over a thousand people were arrested, with 780 of us held and several hundred released.Bob GregsonEvery now and then during the night there would come the word that the demonstrators would attack at a certain part of the perimeter. The klieg lights from the flatbed press trailer would come on, the marshals standing behind our perimeter would rush over to that area with their batons, and a surge would happen. When some broke through our lines the marshals would whack them and, I assume, arrest them.We stayed all night on the Pentagon steps, with tear gas wafting around us. In one of those surreal memories, I can still see Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara watching us, silhouetted, with a bright light behind him, on a lower Pentagon balcony. I imagined I could even see the distinctive part in his hair!Pat GravesJim LaurieAfter midnight Sunday morning, tens of thousands had dwindled to several hundred hard core activists. They were ready to be taken off to jail. Marshals barked orders. Demonstrators sang \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d M.P.\u2019s carried them into police wagons.Pat GravesIn another show of aggression, several of the marshals took our soldiers\u2019 canteens and poured water behind the line. The pavement sloped toward the demonstrators. Wet clothing added to the discomfort of the demonstrators, who were sitting and lying on the ground. The demonstrators built numerous fires to ward off the chill.Trudi SchutzI got pneumonia.Nadya WilliamsToward what must have been around 6 a.m., the crowd (and, perhaps, the Mobilization\u2019s leaders) decided to beat a \u201cdignified retreat,\u201d as we all stood up and walked back over the bridge as the day was dawning. Frankly, I was much relieved to be leaving, as it was very apparent that we were \u201cgoing to get our asses kicked\u201d if we stayed on the entrance steps into the Pentagon during daylight.Bob GregsonSoon after daylight, the commanding general gave the order to clear out the remaining demonstrators from the entry area. That was a welcome command! We rushed forward on exhausted legs that had seemingly locked in place, and the remaining demonstrators ran away.Nancy KurshanI was arrested alongside Anita Hoffman [the wife of Abbie Hoffman]. It was the first time either of us had been under arrest. I would later learn that it was a very atypical arrest experience. They took hundreds of us, all women, to what seemed to be a huge dormitory. There were scores and scores of cots lined up next to each other, like being in a huge summer camp. Anita and I were able to stay together and were on cots right alongside each other. The camaraderie was palpable and exciting. After spending the night on our cots, we were herded to court and as counseled by our movement lawyers, we pleaded nolo contendere. This was worked out between the government and our lawyers. We did what we were advised, paid a small fine and went home.Pat GravesBefore we departed, Bob Gregson\u2019s company surged forward and captured a large yellow submarine. It measured approximately eight feet long, three feet wide and four feet tall at the conning tower. Its rounded wooden frame was made with two-by-fours, covered with stiff canvas painted yellow with red trim. The Beatles\u2019 \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d had become a rallying song for some anarchists. With an eye to history, Bob had his troops retrieve the craft for presentation to the Smithsonian. Unfortunately, his first sergeant had no appreciation of history and had it destroyed.Bob GregsonThe final box score: zero killed; zero wounded; one submarine captured; zero artifacts left for future generations.Bill ZimmermanAt first light, only several hundred remained, but we had escaped arrest and injury and believed we had made our point. We got up, formed a line and marched three miles to the White House. It was early and we wanted to wake up, or at least shake up, President Johnson. We paraded under his windows until motorcycle cops drove us off with nightsticks. But we were there long enough to make sure Johnson heard the chant that by then had become emblematic of the antiwar movement: \u201cHey, hey, L.B.J., how many kids did you kill today?\u201dNadya WilliamsI managed to get on a bus home and remember a stop at a Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurant. In the women\u2019s restroom, several young women had their heads in the sink to try to wash the blood off their skulls and out of their hair from the rifle-butt blows from the guards at the top of the steps.The march on the Pentagon probably did not make much of an impact on public opinion about the war, but participants roundly say that it galvanized their own role in the antiwar movement, and in many cases inspired them to a life of progressive activism.Leslie H. GelbIt wasn\u2019t the howls outside [the Pentagon] that caused some of us to begin raising questions about that horrific war. That began in a sustained and serious way only in early 1968, after the Communist Tet Offensive. By that time, it seemed the protesters knew something we didn\u2019t.James AndersonIt was, and still is, unclear to me that the Pentagon demonstration accomplished as much as it might have. However it did show clearly that the intensity of public dislike of the war was growing rapidly. In the next two years demonstrations went in size from perhaps 100,000 participants at the Pentagon to millions in the worldwide Moratorium demonstrations of 1969. Politicians noticed and eventually responded.Jane OphoffOur participation was not a sophomore lark. We felt that by adding our peaceful presence to our strong convictions, we had been part of something important, a movement that grew and eventually succeeded in turning the tide against the war. We felt proud and patriotic, as I still do 50 years later.Nancy KurshanIn the end, the victory was really a result of the energy and the numbers of the people that participated. Even the children of officials in the Johnson administration were joining us. In a political sense the country was now really at war with itself. This realization seemed to hold within itself the possibility that we could end the war with Vietnam.Bill RamseyIn many ways, the sun has never set on that long stretch of a day, and I have remained on that crowded Pentagon landing \u2014 launched for a lifetime.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of an antiwar fundraiser in Washington. It was Oct. 19, not Oct. 20.\u00a0In addition, an earlier version of a credit on a picture with this essay misstated the affiliation of the photographer, Bernie Boston.

{"Headline": "Fear vs. Hope: Battle Lines Drawn Over a Constitutional Convention", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 For as long as anyone can remember, dysfunction has ruled New York\u2019s capital: Corruption is common, power is limited to a few, and habitual calls for change disappear like the sun on a January day.But next month, the voters of New York have a chance to force a wide-open, monthslong, everything-on-the-table examination of the state\u2019s founding document by authorizing a constitutional convention, a sight not seen here since Robert F. Kennedy was the state\u2019s junior United States senator.In New York\u2019s case, however, the changes to the State Constitution could be profound, as could the impact on the inner workings of Albany and beyond. Ethics reform, sweeping changes to the judiciary, easing the stranglehold of power exerted by the governor and legislative leaders \u2014 all of it would be fair game for consideration.\u201cIt comes down to fear versus hope,\u201d said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a good government organization that is neutral on Proposition 1. \u201cThe fear that something bad could come out of it, and the hope that something good could.\u201dStill, with such high stakes, the convention campaign has upset the normal political alliances in New York.Conservatives and major labor groups, for instance, have been fighting together to defeat Proposition 1, fearing either the expansion of onerous regulations or an erosion of worker protections and perks.Republican and Democratic legislative leaders in Albany have both disparaged the idea, citing its high cost and the danger of allowing little-known delegates to revamp the Constitution.\u201cBattling this type of thing on social media is very difficult,\u201d said John Conklin, a board spokesman.In an off-year election with little other drama, including a tepid mayor\u2019s race in New York City, the heated campaign around Proposition 1 has stood out.\u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-generation opportunity,\u201d said Gerald Benjamin, a political-science professor and an outspoken supporter of Proposition 1, reeling off a raft of possible reforms, including ending gerrymandering and increasing legislative powers. \u201cThese are fundamental structural questions, and we know they can only be solved by constitutional change.\u201dStill, Mr. Samuels said that advertisements and continued chaos in Washington had dimmed the chances of the proposition passing.\u201cThe effect of Trump nationally, even here in New York, of people putting their heads in the sand, versus fighting back with courage, is very worrisome,\u201d said Mr. Samuels, a millionaire who made his fortune in software. \u201cThe fear is real and fascinating.\u201dIf the ballot measure were to pass, some 200 delegates \u2014 elected in November 2018 \u2014 would be summoned to Albany the following April for several months of debate, discussion and drafting of proposed changes.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo exemplifies the kind of mixed emotions that many in the state seemingly feel about Proposition 1. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is thought to have national ambitions, has expressed support for the idea of a convention.But the governor has done no campaigning on its behalf, and says he worries about the event\u2019s being hijacked by legislators who already dominate Albany \u2014 a concern loudly voiced by the anti-convention forces.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a convention of the current elected officials to rewrite the Constitution,\u201d he said earlier this month, \u201cthat defeats the purpose.\u201dThe last convention in New York was in 1967, after a Democrat-led Legislature eager to discuss issues like education and taxation asked \u2014 and received \u2014 approval from voters. One of those delegates was David N. Dinkins, who would later become New York City\u2019s first African-American mayor.Now 90, Mr. Dinkins suggested that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s fears about undue influence from already-elected officials were valid.\u201cIn many ways it was a lot like the Legislature,\u201d Mr. Dinkins recalled, adding that most major decisions were made by a handful of people. \u201cI don\u2019t have a recollection of an offer being made by leadership that was rejected by debate on the floor.\u201dIn the end, the proposals suggested by the 1967 delegates were voted down, including codification of First Amendment rights, changes to taxation and education, and repealing prohibitions on government aid to religious schools.For his part, Mr. Dinkins isn\u2019t sure how he will vote on Nov. 7, saying \u201cif it\u2019s an opportunity to make some new law, some good law, I might support it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll decide sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. Dinkins said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cooking, Inspired by Grandma, at My Cuban Spot in Brooklyn", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City7 PhotosSometimes it\u2019s a relief to eat a dish that makes no pretense of beauty, that settles for simply being delicious.Louie Estrada, the chef, is Miami born and bred, with family roots in pre-revolutionary Cuba. He used to devour huevos fritos as an after-school snack at his grandmother\u2019s house on Calle Ocho in Little Havana. His slip of a storefront, which he opened in August with his best friend, Rafael Almeida, is modeled after the strip\u2019s cafeter\u00edas and ventanitas (coffee windows), with a turquoise door that conjures up old Havana \u2014 or the Miami Dolphins.The menu is divided between sandwiches and rice bowls, both of which will have their partisans. Every sandwich has a base of Cuban bread, soft and airy from a daub of lard in the dough, buttered on both sides and then buttered again mid-grilling. Tucked on the side are golden coins of fried green plantains with a brisk snap.Pork butt, marinated in mojo piqued with bitter orange (\u201cThe way my dad did it,\u201d Mr. Estrada said), is roasted for a half-day until it obligingly falls apart. The pork is the glory of the Cubano, a compressed layer cake of a sandwich with a bright stripe of mustard over the bread and pickles sliced thin on a mandolin to diffuse their tang. It builds upward: blushing ham, Swiss cheese gone woozy and, at the top, pork to rule them all. It\u2019s flattened on the grill under a weight so that the flavors seal into one. The pork is still juicy on arrival, salty rivulets running through it.For pan con lechon, the tangle of pork is topped with sweated onions and matchstick potatoes, poking out of the sides like loose thatch. A New York strip steak seethes satisfyingly in the pan con bistec. The Cuban take on a hamburger, frita, is a soft patty of ground beef and pork bound by tomato paste and stitches of cumin and paprika, slathered with a \u201csecret\u201d sauce of the same ingredients; its appeal might rely on nostalgia.The roast pork is reprised over rice and inky frijoles simmered in sofrito and red wine vinegar until they are tender but still discrete. The fish of the day, often tilapia, swai or cod, appears burnished by saz\u00f3n, a Latin spice blend with an orange streak of achiote; it needs nothing more. Best of all is picadillo, ground beef simmered for two hours in crushed tomatoes, with green olives bringing an almost voluptuous brininess. This is the dish that made Mr. Estrada open My Cuban Spot: \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to get a picadillo like my grandma made.\u201d (His version omits the usual raisins. His grandmother used to serve them on the side, because he never liked them.)On hand to counter the salt and fat are the sodas of Mr. Estrada\u2019s childhood: Materva, a brew of yerba mat\u00e9, with a lollipop start and an earthy finish; Ironbeer (pronounced Ee-ron-bear), somewhere between Dr Pepper and a melted Creamsicle; and Jupi\u00f1a, short for jugo de pi\u00f1a (pineapple juice), the sweetest of all.My Cuban Spot wouldn\u2019t be a ventanita without Caf\u00e9 Bustelo, carefully dripped into a tin with sugar \u2014 Mr. Estrada uses two tins, mixing one into the other, to keep the measurements exact \u2014 and then beaten so the sugar rises in a froth to the top, called espumita. Order a colada, and you get three shots with tiny plastic demitasses, for sharing.The menu is annotated with notes on the Cubano\u2019s origins (as the lunch of cigar-factory and sugar-mill workers) and memories of pan con lechon, \u201calways done with leftover pork on Christmas Day.\u201d There\u2019s also a cheeky warning in a quote from the sandwich-shop scene in \u201cScarface,\u201d when Manny rebuffs a customer who demands more ham.\u201cQue m\u00e1s carne ni m\u00e1s carne, as\u00ed viene el sandwich men\u201d: More meat, what more meat? That\u2019s how the sandwich comes, man. That\u2019s life.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Fall Finally Reform Men?", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThis reckoning is all to the good, even if it is far too late. It feels as though a real and lasting transformation may be afoot \u2014 until you remember that this isn\u2019t the first time women have sounded the alarm.Remember former President Bill Clinton, whose popularity endures despite a long string of allegations of sexual misconduct and, in one case, rape \u2014 all of which he has denied. Mr. Clinton did eventually admit to the affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky, that nearly toppled his presidency, but he pointed out that it was not illegal.In other words, even the highest-profile opportunities to change America\u2019s endemic culture of sexual harassment, which is overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, committed by men against women, can somehow be lost or swept away. How do we keep that from happening again?And how do we ensure that progress filters down to average American workplaces, where sexual harassment occurs all the time but rarely gets media attention? The answer is part cultural, part economic and part legal.The reasons for this silence are obvious: Women fear retaliation, indifference or disbelief if they speak up. If it\u2019s hard for rich and famous people, so many of whom kept silent in the face of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s well-known depredations, imagine how much harder it is for someone with no political or economic power. But the Weinstein saga also illustrates what a difference it can make when women join together \u2014 and men join with them \u2014 to confront harassers openly.But speaking up only goes so far if employers don\u2019t make reporting harassment easy or the consequences for harassers swift and clear. Treating sexual harassment seriously is essential, not to protect against liability or to safeguard the bottom line, but because it\u2019s wrong for anyone to have to endure harassment at work. (Though it sure helps when liability and the bottom line are at stake, too.)One compromise could be to require businesses to report how many sexual-harassment claims they settle every year, or even how many complaints they receive. This would at least give prospective employees a chance to assess how bad the problem is at a given company, and could lead to greater public scrutiny in more extreme cases.This may turn out to be the year when the tide finally turned on sexual harassment. The elements for a permanent cultural shift are certainly in place. More women have entered the work force, and the pay gap with men is closing, though not fast enough. More women than men are graduating from college; more are earning advanced degrees; and increasing numbers are managers, though the proportions of women still become thinner and thinner the higher in management you look. And, crucially, the internet and social media have opened a door to instant communication and community support that didn\u2019t exist before, helping women feel less isolation and shame about their experiences, and more confident that speaking out will have a positive result.In the end, though, the most lasting change will have to come from men, who are doing virtually all the sexual harassing. Boys must be raised to understand why that behavior is wrong, teenagers need to be reminded of it and grown men need to pay for it until they get the message.Advertisement"}

His company, Slide Fire Solutions, won approval from federal firearms regulators, and the business moved from a portable building that had once been a dog kennel into a much larger space on the Cottle family farm.Sales exceeded $10 million and 35,000 units in the first year.\u201cWe literally made our first million in a doghouse,\u201d Mr. Cottle told The Albany News of Texas in 2011.Before long, retailers like Walmart and Cabela\u2019s pulled bump stocks from their websites. Some gun owners, fearing an imminent crackdown, flooded social media looking to buy them.Lawmakers, including Republicans in Congress, have called for bump stocks to be banned. The National Rifle Association said in a statement on Thursday that it \u201cbelieves that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.\u201dSlide Fire \u2014 which boasts on its website that it \u201crevolutionized recreational shooting\u201d \u2014 soon ran out of stock and stopped taking orders.But bump stocks, he said, can help a semiautomatic firearm recreate the adrenaline-inducing power of an automatic weapon.\u201cSome people like drag racing, some people like skiing and some people, like me, love full auto,\u201d he told Ammoland.Fiercely protective of his creation, Mr. Cottle has repeatedly \u2014 and successfully \u2014 sued competitors for patent infringement. But before this week, the product remained largely obscure except in certain gun enthusiast circles.\u201cIt was only ever a niche product to begin with \u2014 it was a tiny component of the industry that wasn\u2019t really well known,\u201d said Rommel Dionisio, managing director at Aegis Capital. \u201cIt was never a significant seller.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s considered the Mr. Potato Head of firearms, because you can put a lot of different accessories on it \u2014 barrels, sound suppressors, scopes and more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe accessories market exploded.\u201dEquipment, apparel and supplies constitute 12.8 percent of the $2.5 billion online gun and ammunition industry, with ammunition, handguns and long guns making up the rest, according to IBISWorld, a market research firm.Slide Fire sells online and also through a retail network that, within 11 months of starting business, included 500 outlets, according to The Albany News.Mr. Cottle joined the military at 19 and was in the Air Force for nine years, attaining the rank of staff sergeant. He was involved in the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts, and medically retired from the military after developing meningitis and encephalitis, he told The Abilene Reporter-News in 2006.Back in Texas, while out shooting with a friend, Mr. Cottle was frustrated with his weapon\u2019s firing speed, according to The Albany News. He crafted a prototype bump stock out of wood and metal in two hours.The letter noted that the stock \u201chas no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed.\u201d It also mentioned that Mr. Cottle\u2019s letter had described the bump stock as \u201cintended to assist persons whose hands have limited mobility to \u2018bump-fire\u2019 an AR-15 type rifle.\u201dSlide Fire\u2019s product \u201cgrants shooters the freedom of controlled rapid fire without compromising the safety of themselves or others around them,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website. Mr. Cottle has appeared on YouTube promoting his bump stocks, priced from $140 to $300.But the internet also abounds with tutorials on how to gin up homemade versions of the accessory using belt loops and rubber bands. On YouTube, videos show AR-15 rifles equipped with 3D-printed bump stocks and \u201cbump boards\u201d made of wood.Mr. Cottle is listed as an inventor on several slide-action stock patents and has doggedly defended his products against copycats.\u201cThe technology sets our company apart,\u201d Mr. Cottle said in a video on the company website. \u201cThere is no one that does what we do.\u201dIn 2014, Slide Fire sued Bump Fire, a company selling $99 bump stocks. Slide Fire alleged infringement on eight of its patents, winning a court judgment last year that forced Bump Fire to stop producing and selling stocks that functionally mirror Slide Fire\u2019s products.Back home, Slide Fire is seen as a hometown anchor of sorts. Mr. Cottle hired local residents, including a former teacher and a neighbor, and became a major employer in the area, according to The Albany News.He told the publication that the company\u2019s success was a miracle.\u201cThis is beyond a Cinderella story,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

As word spread that a local architect who had created one of its showstopper installations was on-site, a steady stream of curious security guards appeared.Between their shifts, each was eager to meet the man who built an engrossingly realistic four-foot-high model of a bombed-out apartment building, one seemingly airlifted from the civil war engulfing Damascus, Syria.By day he helps design soaring glass and steel skyscrapers for Pickard Chilton, an architectural firm in New Haven. At night his scale becomes palm-size as he carefully transforms scavenged piano keys, old radio components, a gas-mask filter and even a dried eggplant into the weathered building blocks of tiny urban edifices.\u201cThere\u2019s something about detailed miniatures that intrigues people of all ages, from 7 to 70,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a way of raising awareness in a way the news media doesn\u2019t.

For Ms. Josenhans, who is accustomed to today\u2019s sculptors farming out much of their time-intensive labor to fabricators, \u00e0 la Jeff Koons, it was a pleasant surprise to discover that Mr. Hafez was a solo act.The Open Studios event wasn\u2019t the first time Mr. Hafez exhibited his models, but it was the debut of a new approach, one that eschewed picture-perfect classical structures from a mythologized ancient Damascus for one that evoked the city\u2019s current apocalyptic setting. This shift was the result of a 2011 layover in Damascus. Although Mr. Hafez has a green card, visa snafus turned a six-day visit into a six-week stay. It was also the beginning of the Arab Spring\u2019s reach into Syria.As demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad erupted in the country\u2019s southern cities, the once-unimaginable idea of democratic change seemed deliriously possible. \u201cMy whole family watched the TV as if we were witnessing aliens landing on earth,\u201d Mr. Hafez recalled. Yet he also saw a column of tanks roll out of a military base near his parents\u2019 home and ominously rumble south.While Mr. Hafez is immensely proud to have his work, \u201cBaggage Series #4,\u201d featured in \u201cArtists in Exile\u201d alongside pieces by figures like Shirin Neshat and Kurt Schwitters, the show\u2019s title leaves him uneasy: To call oneself an exile implies an intention to return to one\u2019s native country.\u201cSuch a mind-set means you\u2019re not invested in your current country,\u201d he explained. \u201cI don\u2019t like that way of living.

A top executive of a mutual fund admitted that Wall Street miscalculated the risk of buying all those unsustainable tax-free bonds from Puerto Rico in the first place and may actually have to lose some money on the deal.After all, said Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles & Co.: \u201cThey are U.S. citizens. We are U.S. citizens. We have an obligation to help.\u201dPresident Trump, who has made some halfhearted and condescending efforts to show concern about Puerto Rico, is having none of that nonsense.In one of his deranged early-morning Twitter rants, Trump said on Thursday that Puerto Rico\u2019s \u201cinfrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.\u201d He said Congress, which he knows perfectly well can\u2019t do much of anything, has to \u201cdecide how much to spend\u201d and warned that he \u201ccannot keep\u201d federal disaster relief officials and the military in \u201cP.R. forever!\u201dHe quoted a public-affairs show host for the right-wing Sinclair Broadcast Group as saying the financial crisis in Puerto Rico is \u201clargely of their own making.\u201dPuerto Rico\u2019s government and business bear a responsibility for the financial crisis there, but even more so do American bankers and Congress, which dragged its feet on the issue for far too long.Trump must be aware that Puerto Ricans are citizens of the United States, even though they have always been treated as second-class citizens. After all, he was just there recently, tossing rolls of \u201cbeautiful, soft\u201d paper towels into a crowd with that familiar smug look on his face.Trump must know that he has made no threat to withdraw aid from Texas \u2014 which, unlike Puerto Rico, he considers part of his constituency \u2014 and that federal disaster aid and recovery efforts often take years.He also possesses detailed, highly technical knowledge about Puerto Rico. He knows, for example, that it \u201cis an island, surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water.\u201dBut the president\u2019s handling of the disaster in Puerto Rico has been shameful from the start. He heaped scorn on San Juan\u2019s mayor for appealing for help to what she assumed was his humanity. And he whined that Puerto Ricans had \u201cthrown our budget a little out of whack,\u201d because of course they must have planned the hurricane.He also congratulated Puerto Ricans during his recent visit on having suffered only 16 deaths from the hurricane, unlike a \u201creal catastrophe.\u201d(Shortly after Trump left, the office of Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 announced that the death toll was more that twice that, which Trump and Rossell\u00f3 had to know when they met. It beggars belief that 19 more bodies were discovered while Trump was climbing the stairs to his airplane.)As usual, it\u2019s impossible to divine Trump\u2019s precise motivations.Maybe he was trying to distract attention from all the other ways he is harming American citizens by gutting Obamacare, advocating a huge tax break for rich folks like him, threatening nuclear war, trying to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, shredding environmental protections and, well, it\u2019s too long a list for this column.Maybe he heard something on a politically friendly TV show and decided to regurgitate it on Twitter.Or maybe he just believes, as so many other American politicians sadly do, that Puerto Ricans are inferior and that they are freeloaders.Puerto Rico\u2019s residents are our brothers and sisters, our fellow citizens.

I don\u2019t remember much about that game, but Novato won, and one of the goals was scored by the smallest girl on the team, a quick and feisty forward who wears a long ponytail and jersey No. 8. We whooped and cheered her name. I found out later that her parents weren\u2019t there that afternoon. They were in Las Vegas for a getaway weekend.About 36 hours later, I was on my way to Las Vegas myself, rushing to join my New York Times colleagues to cover the latest mass shooting, maybe bigger than them all. I hadn\u2019t covered one of them since 1999, when I was in the wrong place at the right time and rushed into the aftermath of Columbine.A colleague of mine and I checked into a massive suite at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, 11 floors directly below that of the shooter. It had the same view of the concert ground across the Strip, where investigators in the daylight were picking through the carnage of the night before. That was about when my wife sent me a text. That little soccer player\u2019s mom was at the concert the night before, she said. She\u2019s missing.But Stacee Etcheber was not my story. The gunman was. I spent a week mostly about 100 feet below where the shooter committed mass murder, trying to solve the mystery of what he\u2019d done. I talked to people, followed every lead and wrote stories. It\u2019s what reporters do. It was a news story, as horrific as they come, and we\u2019re trained to keep our emotional distance from the things that we cover.Late that night, I stood in front of the window, the same one that a madman broke 11 floors above and used as a perch to shoot hundreds of people he did not know. The body count was on its way to 58. I thought about home.Stacee\u2019s family soon announced that she died. My wife and I didn\u2019t really know Stacee much \u2014 obviously not well enough to notice that she was not among the few dozen people at a rec-level girls\u2019 soccer game. But some of our closest friends were dear friends of hers, and our town is small enough that there was probably no more than two degrees of separation to the family.My family was among the hundreds of people, friends and strangers, who crowded onto the grounds of an elementary school and held candles aloft during the vigil. My daughter was one of the dozens of kids who solemnly held roses in her honor, and she hugged her classmate and teammate when it ended. She and a couple of friends made a cake and delivered it to the Etchebers\u2019 house the next day.Orange was Stacee\u2019s favorite color, and on Friday, after people bought as much orange ribbon as they could find at all the local craft stores, an army tied ribbons all around town, from the trees on downtown\u2019s Grant Avenue to the posts in front of Pioneer Park. My wife and her friends tied them around the trees in front of the middle school where Stacee\u2019s daughter goes to school, along with mine.I missed it all. I was as close to the site of the shooting as you could get, and yet felt fully disconnected from the effect of the tragedy. One night I walked to the memorial that sprang up in the median of South Las Vegas Boulevard, the kind of now-familiar post-shooting memorial that I saw at Columbine almost two decades before, with balloons and flowers and candles. I found a photo of Stacee that had been placed in the middle of it all, and took a picture and sent it home.In Las Vegas, Stacee was just one in a crowd, part of a list. But she and her family were all anyone talked or thought about back in Novato, and that is where I got my news. I heard that Stacee\u2019s husband, a San Francisco police officer, was running with Stacee through the barrage of gunfire when he stopped to help someone; he told his wife to go on and never saw her alive again. I heard that television news trucks were parked in front of the house. I heard stories of friends pulling over in their cars to cry at the weight and nearness of it all. There were beautiful and crushingly sad Facebook posts in Stacee\u2019s honor, the kind you see after every tragedy, except these were written by people I knew well.I heard my wife, who grew up in a nearby town, tell me that she had never been more proud to call Novato home.I checked out of that Mandalay Bay suite on Saturday morning, excused from reporting duties, and flew home in the hopes of making my daughter\u2019s soccer game. I found the red rose from the vigil, starting to fade and wilt, in a vase on the kitchen counter. When we got to the game, we and the other parents were somewhat surprised to see Stacee\u2019s husband and extended family there, too. Warming up with the girls was No. 8, with her long ponytail.We all wore orange ribbons, attached by safety pins, including the girls on both teams. The Novato team wore orange armbands with the initials \u201cS.E.\u201d Before kickoff, both squads came across the field to the spectator side and lined up in straight lines. Our team\u2019s coach asked the parents to stand for 30 seconds of silence. And then two of the league\u2019s better teams played a rather meaningless soccer game, only this one felt about as meaningful as anything I\u2019ve ever watched.And it was late in the second half when the ball suddenly swung from one end to the other, and Stacee\u2019s daughter gave chase through three retreating opponents and beat them all to the ball. And in one blink-and-you-missed-it moment, she booted the ball into the corner of the net for what held on as the winning goal.Her teammates chased her and swarmed her, and they and she looked as free and happy as girls can be on a sunny fall Saturday afternoon with their friends. The parents jumped and cheered as loudly as I\u2019ve heard parents cheer at a kids\u2019 soccer game. Behind my sunglasses, I was bawling. It was the first time I\u2019d cried all week.Advertisement"}

Harvey Weinstein could change everything.Late Friday, Amazon decided not to move forward with a Weinstein-produced mafia series from David O. Russell that had previously received a two-season commitment and was estimated to cost $160 million.\u201cWe support Amazon\u2019s decision as in light of recent news and out of respect for all those affected we have decided together that it is best to not move forward with this show,\u201d Mr. Russell said in a statement with two stars of the series, Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore.Even so, many people in Hollywood think the academy only has one option when it comes to Mr. Weinstein: Kick him out.Censuring Mr. Weinstein, a fixture on the Oscar circuit for two decades who lived for the validation the awards gave him, would also be a chance for Hollywood to reckon with a past that includes rampant mistreatment of women \u2014 all the way back to the days of Mayer and his fellow good-old-boy studio chiefs.\u201cThe idea that anyone would give him a second chance or entertain that notion that he can change is beyond absurd,\u201d Terry Press, the president of CBS Films, wrote on Facebook of Mr. Weinstein. \u201cIf the academy does not kick him out, I am resigning my academy membership.\u201dThe academy declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein beyond a statement it released midweek.\u201cThe academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent and antithetical to the high standards of the academy and the creative community it represents,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in a diminished state more recently, he remained a player, prodding the tiny art film \u201cLion\u201d to six nominations this year.In total, Mr. Weinstein has overseen campaigns that have resulted in more than 300 Academy Award nominations and best-picture Oscars for \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d \u201cChicago,\u201d \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Artist.\u201d In addition to his one Oscar win, Mr. Weinstein also holds one nomination, for producing \u201cGangs of New York.\u201dSeven months ago, Mr. Weinstein was in his element when he hosted the Weinstein Company\u2019s annual pre-Oscars party at the Montage Beverly Hills hotel.

{"Headline": "Paul S. Otellini, Who Led Intel and Saw It Grow Even More, Dies at 66", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paul S. Otellini, who as chief executive expanded Intel\u2019s already commanding chip-making business but failed to build a company franchise in mobile phones, died on Monday at his family\u2019s second home in Sonoma County, Calif. He was 66.Where Mr. Grove and his immediate predecessor, Craig R. Barrett, were tough taskmasters, Mr. Otellini was known for a softer, more personable touch. \u201cHe solved problems without yelling like some of his predecessors,\u201d Mr. Barrett wrote in an email. \u201cProbably the best decision I made as C.E.O. was to recommend him as my replacement.\u201dThrough the 1980s and \u201990s, Intel solidified its position in personal computers as advances in manufacturing produced chips that ran software faster. But Mr. Otellini faced a series of challenges when he became chief executive in May 2005.At the time, Intel\u2019s chips consumed too much power and generated too much heat. The company\u2019s rival Advanced Micro Devices had introduced attractive processors that grabbed a sizable chunk of the market. AMD followed up with an antitrust lawsuit against Intel that prompted government investigations by the authorities in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe.Mr. Otellini battled back by listening to customers, former colleagues said. That approach was recognized when he got an onstage hug in June 2005 from Steve Jobs, then Apple\u2019s chief executive, who had agreed to switch to Intel technology for the company\u2019s popular Macintosh computer line.Mr. Otellini pushed Intel to develop more energy-efficient chips, fueling a trend in which laptop computers were beginning to supplant desktop models. In the case of winning Apple\u2019s Mac business, Mr. Otellini also agreed to offer very low prices.\u201cHe was willing to take an upfront hit to forge a partnership,\u201d Andy Bryant, Intel\u2019s chairman, said.But Mr. Otellini later admitted to making a major miscue in the mobile market. Those devices were mainly built using chip technology developed by ARM Holdings, which drew much less power than PC chips and was licensed to multiple manufacturers that competed on price and features.Intel for a time built ARM chips, too, but that business was unprofitable. Mr. Otellini dropped it, opting to court phone makers with Intel\u2019s mainstay x86 chip design.Intel was still in the running as a supplier when Apple was developing the first iPhone, which was introduced in 2007, ushering in what would become a giant market for smartphones. Mr. Otellini underestimated the iPhone\u2019s sales potential and viewed Apple\u2019s price demands as onerous.Though Intel missed the smartphone boom, it won over internet companies like Google and Facebook on the way to grabbing nearly all of the market for chips used in data centers. In all, Intel estimated, the company\u2019s annual revenue rose to $53 billion from $34 billion under Mr. Otellini.He also left a legacy as a peacemaker when Intel settled its court battles with regulators and A.M.D. \u201cThat was driven by Otellini more than anyone else,\u201d said Hector Ruiz, a former A.M.D. chief who launched the litigation.Paul Stevens Otellini, the son of Dave Otellini, a butcher, and his wife, Evelyn, was born in San Francisco on Oct. 12, 1950. (He continued to live there despite a long commute to Intel\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara.) He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from the University of San Francisco and an M.B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley.He is survived by his second wife, of 30 years, Sandy Otellini; his son, Patrick; and his daughter, Alexis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I. Talent", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "Nearly all big tech companies have an artificial intelligence project, and they are willing to pay experts millions of dollars to help get it done.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s start-ups have always had a recruiting advantage over the industry\u2019s giants: Take a chance on us and we\u2019ll give you an ownership stake that could make you rich if the company is successful.Now the tech industry\u2019s race to embrace artificial intelligence may render that advantage moot \u2014 at least for the few prospective employees who know a lot about A.I.Typical A.I. specialists, including both Ph.D.s fresh out of school and people with less education and just a few years of experience, can be paid from $300,000 to $500,000 a year or more in salary and company stock, according to nine people who work for major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them. All of them requested anonymity because they did not want to damage their professional prospects.Well-known names in the A.I. field have received compensation in salary and shares in a company\u2019s stock that total single- or double-digit millions over a four- or five-year period. And at some point they renew or negotiate a new contract, much like a professional athlete.At the top end are executives with experience managing A.I. projects. In a court filing this year, Google revealed that one of the leaders of its self-driving-car division, Anthony Levandowski, a longtime employee who started with Google in 2007, took home over $120 million in incentives before joining Uber last year through the acquisition of a start-up he had co-founded that drew the two companies into a court fight over intellectual property.Salaries are spiraling so fast that some joke the tech industry needs a National Football League-style salary cap on A.I. specialists. \u201cThat would make things easier,\u201d said Christopher Fernandez, one of Microsoft\u2019s hiring managers. \u201cA lot easier.\u201dThere are a few catalysts for the huge salaries. The auto industry is competing with Silicon Valley for the same experts who can help build self-driving cars. Giant tech companies like Facebook and Google also have plenty of money to throw around and problems that they think A.I. can help solve, like building digital assistants for smartphones and home gadgets and spotting offensive content.Most of all, there is a shortage of talent, and the big companies are trying to land as much of it as they can. Solving tough A.I. problems is not like building the flavor-of-the-month smartphone app. In the entire world, fewer than 10,000 people have the skills necessary to tackle serious artificial intelligence research, according to Element AI, an independent lab in Montreal.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d said Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, who previously worked at Google. \u201cThey are anxious to ensure that they\u2019ve got this small cohort of people\u201d who can work on this technology.\u201cIt is hard to compete with that, especially if you are one of the smaller companies,\u201d said Jessica Cataneo, an executive recruiter at the tech recruiting firm CyberCoders.By 2013, Google, Facebook and a few other companies started to recruit the relatively few researchers who specialized in these techniques. Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft\u2019s Skype phone service.With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.\u201cThere is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.\u201cThere are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,\u201d Mr. Zettlemoyer said. \u201cThe salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.\u201dThe basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call \u201ca dark art.\u201d Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with Google, and I don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. \u201cSo I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.\u201dBut the industry\u2019s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won\u2019t be alleviated for years.\u201cOf course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,\u201d Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. \u201cIt takes many years to train a Ph.D.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Out of Control on Contraception", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week in the world of Washington and sex:Is anything wrong with this picture?Many people of good will believe the country\u2019s commitment to human rights makes abortion immoral. Fair enough. The best way to avoid abortions is to avoid unwanted pregnancy, which means making it as easy as possible for women to practice birth control.How can you fight against both abortion and contraception? There are only two possible explanations.One is that you\u2019re a hypocritical politician trolling for right-to-life votes without any personal convictions whatsoever. The suddenly retiring congressman from Pennsylvania, Tim Murphy, would appear to fit into that category. Everyone in Washington has now read the text his girlfriend reportedly sent, complaining that he was making anti-abortion posts on his Facebook page while responding to her news that she might be pregnant by suggesting a quick termination.Farewell, Representative Murphy. If you hadn\u2019t been forced to resign, you\u2019d probably have come up with a terrific post extolling President Trump\u2019s announcement. Even though I\u2019ll bet you were a contraception fan in private life.Let\u2019s call the second category Many Variations on the Little Sisters of the Poor. They\u2019re people of sincere religious conviction, trying to impose their own personal theology on Americans who don\u2019t share it.Some of them claim, with no scientific backing, that birth control involves fertilized eggs being expelled from the uterus and is therefore abortion. Others just believe that it\u2019s immoral for a woman to have sex without accepting the possibility of pregnancy.\u201cTo put it simply, contraception is anti-baby,\u201d says the American Life League on its website.O.K., not a sentiment most Americans share.When the Obama administration was putting the Affordable Care Act into operation, it struggled long and hard to allow employers with anti-contraception convictions to avoid directly providing the benefits, while making sure women still got birth control as part of their health care plan.The Trump backtrack wasn\u2019t about protecting employers\u2019 right to express their \u201csincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d It was about empowering them to impose those beliefs on their workers. \u201cA landmark day for religious liberty,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan.No, it wasn\u2019t. It was a tough day for the First Amendment, for the people who\u2019ve been struggling to make unwanted pregnancies, and abortion, as rare as possible.It worked really well, though, for the hypocrites who want to kowtow to the religious right without any concern for the inevitable consequences.Too bad Representative Murphy won\u2019t be around for the celebrations.Advertisement"}

Tax Plan Rollout Nears: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We\u2019re watching to see how any charges that Robert Mueller files that are related to the Russia investigation affect this week\u2019s tax plan rollout. More on that in a minute.S. & P. futures were down this morning, perhaps because of the newest wrinkle in what was already a complicated legislative process for enacting tax cuts. Republicans still don\u2019t seem to agree on what should be in the plan.The plan is to keep the tough trade-offs in the bill secret until after Halloween, then reach Thanksgiving with bills passed by the House and Senate and hit New Year\u2019s Day with a bill on Mr. Trump\u2019s desk. That\u2019s close to financial-crisis speed, pushing Congress into a kind of emergency lawmaking mode it typically uses only when inaction means cataclysm.Based on Mr. Trump\u2019s own pronouncement, we could learn this week his choice to lead the Federal Reserve. It\u2019s still a guess as to whom the president will nominate \u2014 or even whether that nominee will share the White House zeal for financial deregulation.That may throw up some obstacles to Mr. Powell\u2019s confirmation by the Senate. More from Mr. Appelbaum\u2019s article:\u201cSenator Scott is looking for fresh leadership at the Federal Reserve, and Mr. Powell would have to answer serious concerns both old and new at any potential nomination hearing he might have before the Senate Banking Committee,\u201d said a spokesman for Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. What\u2019s fascinating is the fault line between Mr. Bannon and his particular brand of nationalism, and Mr. Singer, who is considered a \u201cglobalist\u201d \u2014 and has ties to Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.But it\u2019s unclear whether the White House will turn on Mr. Singer. Yes, the Elliott Management founder was an early backer of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement. But he has since signed onto the team of White House supporters, donating to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and providing money for the Republican tax overhaul campaign.Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up:Pushing for answers will be Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. His criticism of technology companies may be surprising, considering he built a fortune as a tech and telecommunication investor and executive. But he wants to ward off further problems.\u201cWhat I fear is 2018. If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I.,\u201d he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.In other problems for tech companies:Information wars in emerging markets may not represent as big a threat to Facebook\u2019s business as angry lawmakers in Washington. But people are dying, and communities are tearing themselves apart with the tools Facebook has built. That should qualify as an even greater emergency in Menlo Park.Shareholder activism, of a sort, appears to be brewing in the N.F.L. as well.\u201cYou don\u2019t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,\u201d one unidentified owner said on the call, according to ESPN.Investing in research and development, and in takeovers, appears to be generating bigger gains these days.

Here are some spots around your house you should consider cleaning more often, if you clean them at all, because they\u2019re probably pretty filthy.Right out of the gate, we should point out that you should clean these spaces not because they\u2019ll make you sick or anything, but because they\u2019re probably pretty gross and collect dirt and dust easily. They may accumulate bacteria as well, but there\u2019s no reason to be a germaphobe about them.People with immune disorders or who are prone to sickness may want to pay closer attention than others, but in many cases, your cleaning efforts are just a good way to keep them in good working order for a nice long time.You probably don\u2019t think to clean off the doorknobs and handles around your home very often, but they\u2019re worth a quick wipe the next time you\u2019re cleaning in the same room. When you think about how often we touch the door knobs and handles in our homes, especially with dirty hands or on the way in or out of the bathroom, you may even choose to make a habit of it.Whether it\u2019s the handle to a kitchen cabinet, the doorknob to the bathroom or just the front door to your home, give it a wipe down from time to time, if for no other reason than to keep them free of debris and pleasant to use.For something we use for hours every day, when\u2019s the last time you did more than just wipe off your smartphone\u2019s screen when it was too smudged to see through? In reality, considering how often we use our phones, and where we use them (yes, that includes checking Facebook on the toilet), our phones deserve a more thorough cleaning from time to time.When you\u2019re not using your phone, you\u2019re probably using a desktop or laptop computer, which means your fingers are constantly in contact with your keyboard.

Then a quick wipe down with cleaning wipes, cotton swabs or a microfiber cloth moistened with that same 1:1 alcohol-to-water solution we mentioned earlier will take care of the parts you actually touch.Be honest: Have you ever cleaned your remote control? Whether you use the one that came with your TV or something complicated that came from your cable company, odds are you pick it up every time you flop down on the couch to Netflix and chill.

They marched in front of the Justice Department before descending on the National Mall to denounce institutionalized racism.\u201cIt\u2019s now an Injustice Department,\u201d said Markus Batchelor, a member of Washington\u2019s State Board of Education representing Ward 8, a predominantly black part of the city where he was raised. \u201cWe\u2019re here because there are concerted efforts to deprive minorities of their rights.

Mr. Castile\u2019s killing, during a traffic stop, was live-streamed on Facebook by his girlfriend.Many of Saturday\u2019s marchers had previously been involved in protests nationwide, including the Charlottesville, Va., clashes with white nationalists. Among their demands were the removal of Confederate monuments, deeper legal investigations into hate crimes, and greater focus on indigenous cultures, colonialism and slavery in textbooks. Throughout the weekend, more than 15 related marches were scheduled to take place around the country.The March for Black Women \u2014 organized to bring attention to the widespread incarceration of black women, sexual violence and murders of black transgender people \u2014 aimed to set itself apart from the huge Women\u2019s March on Washington in January, after Inauguration Day, which received some criticism for a perceived focus on white women\u2019s activism.\u201cLook around, look at the ways you black women show up to a march,\u201d Michaela Angela Davis, a fashion and race writer and activist, said from the rally stage. \u201cBraids, Afro-pops \u2014 y\u2019all can\u2019t fit that under a pink hat.\u201dThe group held a morning rally of several hundred black women and allies before joining the racial justice protesters. Women linked arms as speakers recited the names of black female victims of violence, punctuated by a chant of \u201cSay her name!\u201dThough much smaller, the women\u2019s march did not accidentally overlap with the main rally.\u201cI heard about the March for Racial Justice, and I didn\u2019t think there would be space for black women,\u201d said Farah Tanis, a founder of the group Black Women\u2019s Blueprint and an organizer of the march.But one week after President Trump sparked a national debate over N.F.L. players\u2019 kneeling protest during the national anthem, the two events began together.

So at this point, these guys are just shutting down.\u201dMr. Grazi disagreed. The animals, so-called feeder mice, he said, had been destined to be eaten by reptiles. Here in the shallow tiles beneath gallery-goers feet, they were well-fed and happy.The gallery has been inundated with negative online comments, as well as haranguing phone calls from as far away as Europe. The owner, Vincent Harrison, said the public response had revealed the challenges of weighing criticism against artistic repression, not to mention the well-being of a bunch of rodents.\u201cBothering people, causing conflicting emotions, to me is part of my job as an artist,\u201d Mr. Grazi said. He said he often calls out what he sees as the hypocrisy of treating, say, an eagle better than a chicken in his art. \u201cEverywhere I walk there is some barbaric rat trap, or some sign that says, \u2018We are currently poisoning rats,\u2019 but nobody cares because they are out of sight, out of mind,\u201d he added. \u201cHere the only problem is that they are the opposite: They are in sight, in mind.\u201dMr. Grazi, 33, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, created the mouse-tiled floor installation, called \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d as a commentary on the isolation endemic in social media. Arranged like a chessboard, each tile is roughly a square foot and contains a tiny dish of water, a stick, some food pellets and a little white mouse with red eyes sitting on black sand.On Sunday afternoon, children jumped from square to square, playing hopscotch atop the mice, as the structure creaked.In their little boxes, the mice did mice things, chewing wood or sitting stock-still in tightly knotted poufs. They scrabbled at the clear ceiling, gnawed at the air holes drilled in the top of each box, and tried to shove pink, whiskered noses through the ports.The mice are all available for adoption, and three have been adopted. Those who are not claimed will be fed to Mr. Grazi\u2019s pet ball python, Mr. Clip.In September, the Guggenheim announced the live animals would not be shown, out of \u201cconcern for the safety of its staff, visitors and participating artists,\u201d and said that it was \u201cdismayed\u201d at the attack on freedom of expression. Mr. Grazi said he would consider modifying the piece if he were concerned about animal welfare, but never shutting it down. This week, he will add little hideaways to the terrariums, so the mice have a place to duck into and hide from the shadows above, he said.That did little to satisfy Nicole Hall, an animal activist who lives in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and arrived at the gallery on Sunday to voice her distaste.\u201cI don\u2019t think that living beings should be considered as art,\u201d said Ms. Hall, 47, who works at a rabbit rescue center in Connecticut. \u201cHundreds of years ago, Africans, people from other countries were actually art installations,\u201d said Ms. Hall. \u201cNow, as we have moved away from that, we look back at that and say, \u2018How hideous were we?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Playboy to Feature Its First Transgender Playmate", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time in its 64-year history, Playboy magazine will feature a transgender Playmate, a decision that Cooper Hefner, a top executive at the magazine, said on Thursday was in keeping with its founding mission of embracing changing attitudes about sex.Selecting Ms. Rau \u201cvery much speaks to the brand\u2019s philosophy,\u201d said Mr. Hefner, 26, Playboy\u2019s chief creative officer. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. We\u2019re at a moment where gender roles are evolving.\u201dMr. Hefner said he selected Ms. Rau to be a Playmate two months ago because she\u2019s \u201clovely\u201d and has \u201ca remarkable personality,\u201d but also to resolidify the magazine\u2019s voice. \u201cThis is really a moment for us to take a step back and say that so much of what the brand stood for in the early years is very much still alive in culture.\u201dWhen Ms. Rau \u2014 who has appeared in American Vogue, Italian Vogue and a Balmain campaign, among others \u2014 heard that she would be a Playmate, she cried from happiness, she said on Thursday.\u201cIt was a compliment like I\u2019ve never had,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of beautiful compliments from gentlemen before, but this one really made me feel very special, beautiful and feminine. I was speechless.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of hateful comments,\u201d Ms. Rau said. \u201cI would have never thought about people being so transphobic. I knew we still had a lot of work to do to get to a point where people see trans women as women, but I would have never thought of that.\u201dBut that resistance only adds to her determination, Ms. Rau says. \u201cIt makes me even more proud and happy to have done that, because we need to make a mentality change. We have to.\u201d\u201cMy story is very heavy, and you\u2019re going to always have people who don\u2019t understand and are being very mean, and seeing that, it makes even more sense to fight for awareness and respect,\u201d she said.Mr. Hefner, who said he had not questioned his decision in the slightest, said he was more concerned about moving the conversation around equality and sexuality forward, and less concerned about alienating readers.\u201cI didn\u2019t make that decision based off of whether or not individuals who were paying for products or are fans of the brand are going to be satisfied with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI made the decision because it was the right decision to make, regardless of the comments that come out.\u201dSome commenters on social media insisted that Hugh Hefner would never have allowed a transgender woman to appear in his magazine. But in addition to the fact that Ms. Rau was selected months before his death, her appearance is not the first time Playboy has featured a transgender woman in its pages \u2014 nor is it even Ms. Rau\u2019s first appearance in the magazine.The May 2014 issue came with a special section called Playboy A-Z that featured Ms. Rau fully nude for a spread titled Evolution.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable the lack of knowledge people have in understanding what he was trying to accomplish,\u201d Mr. Hefner said of his father. \u201cAnd that was really to have a conversation about sex that was healthy and bring it out of the closet.\u201dIn March 1965, Playboy had another notable first when Jennifer Jackson, a black woman, was made Playboy Playmate of the Month. Mr. Hefner said the choice elicited letters that used similar language to what he saw on social media on Thursday. Playboy\u2019s social media accounts posted snippets of archival letters from that time alongside new comments about Ms. Rau.One of the letters, which was shared with The New York Times on Thursday, read: \u201cAt the risk of being labeled bigots, racists, reactionaries and sundry other things currently in vogue, we entreat you to return to your time-tested format of Playmate selection, which is more in line with the thinking of the vast majority of your readers.\u201dBut similar to what populated Playboy\u2019s feeds about Ms. Rau, others writing in 1965 applauded the magazine\u2019s progressive stance. \u201cIn your leadership of the avant-garde in modern America, you have taken another giant step forward,\u201d one letter read.When asked about her experience being photographed this year, Ms. Rau said: \u201cI was just thinking of being this little lonely boy in the ghetto, in the shadows in my room. And now I\u2019m in Los Angeles shooting Playboy looking so beautiful, feeling so amazing. I cried of happiness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The public adored the companies\u2019 new devices, educators embraced their tools and politicians extolled their contributions to the economy. Even traditionally powerful voices, like media and telecom businesses, found little success in criticizing the technology industry.The reviews site Yelp, which has long complained about the size and power of Google, has filed a new federal antitrust complaint against the search giant. Media organizations are arguing, to a more receptive Capitol Hill, that internet businesses should have the same advertising disclosure rules that print and television companies do.\u201cWe\u2019ve had low points, when we were out of energy and felt like we weren\u2019t heard,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp. \u201cBut we feel we have a clean slate now.\u201d\u201cBefore, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cBut now the halo is a bit off these companies.\u201dInternet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill. House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending \u2014 a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier. Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers. They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.\u201cIt is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill. In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business,\u201d Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, \u201cand that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.\u201dThe tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well. In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission. In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.\u201cIn the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Google and Facebook and the future of the news business,\u201d Mr. Chavern said in an interview before the hearing.Even nonprofit consumer interest groups are taking advantage of the situation. John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, who is a longtime critic of Google\u2019s collection of personal data, has pushed for online privacy rules and restrictions for self-driving vehicles.

{"Headline": "How the N.C.A.A. Cheats Student Athletes", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusThat shouldn\u2019t really surprise anyone. This scandal isn\u2019t truly about corrupt coaches and shoe salesmen. It\u2019s about the lengths to which the N.C.A.A. goes to control every dollar and branding opportunity associated with college athletics.An illegal economy has operated behind high-level college athletics for a long time. Its root cause is that universities with powerhouse sports teams like U.C.L.A., Ohio State and Texas receive nearly $20 million a year from brands like Adidas or Nike, while the athletes wearing the Adidas or Nike apparel are expected to compete purely for the love of the game.College basketball players are worth a lot of money, but they aren\u2019t legally allowed to make it. So the schools, coaches, agents and shoe companies make the money instead \u2014 all in the name of \u201camateurism.\u201dIt\u2019s clearly time to revise the rules of the N.C.A.A. in favor of the students. But as simply paying the players seems to be a non-starter, let\u2019s begin by reforming the association\u2019s bylaw that prevents college athletes from promoting any personal creative endeavor if they even mention that they participate in a sport.Here\u2019s an example from Macalester College, where I am president. Our school is fortunate to have as a student a young man (whose name I can\u2019t mention) who has published a book (whose title I can\u2019t cite). The book has nothing whatsoever to do with athletics, but among his many activities at the college, he participates in an intercollegiate sport (which, of course, shall remain unspecified).What does this mean in practice? It means that the author\u2019s book biography cannot state that he participates in a college-level sport. It means that, in publicizing the book to students or alumni, the college cannot mention that the author is a student athlete. It even means that the student cannot mention the book on his Facebook page because his Facebook profile shows photos of him engaging in the unspecified sport.Presumably this rule was written to prevent a college athlete, whether from a Division I sports juggernaut or a Division III college like Macalester, from making piles of money after revealing he is an intercollegiate athlete. The N.C.A.A. wants to prevent some Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback or some one-and-done power forward at the University of Kentucky from writing a book or modeling a sweater in order to profit from his collegiate athletic celebrity.Of course, the reasonable response to this concern is: What\u2019s wrong with a person profiting from his own accomplishments and celebrity? Isn\u2019t that more or less the way it\u2019s supposed to work? But the N.C.A.A., not content with the billions in TV and merchandising revenue it already takes in, is determined to leave no spare change under the couch cushions.The most repugnant aspect of this N.C.A.A. rule is that it runs directly counter to the optimal American college education. We want students to have multiple interests, multiple facets to their personal and academic lives, and to explore openly how those various identities play out. We want a student athlete to think \u2014 and talk \u2014 about what it means to be an athlete and an author, or an athlete and an entrepreneur, or an athlete and an artist. But a student who designs and sells greeting cards and mentions on her Facebook page that she is a softball player risks losing her athletic eligibility. That is shameful. Bylaw 12.5.1.3 has got to go.Given all of the stereotypes about student athletes as prizing sports over academics, one would think that the N.C.A.A. would be enthusiastic about opportunities to shatter those. But given the choice between doing so and inadvertently allowing an athlete to profit from even the most tangential connection to his or her own athletic efforts, the N.C.A.A. has decided to force students to disguise who they are.For those few students who star in Division I, it is an invitation to enter into a sad but unsurprising underground economy. For Division III athletes, the hypocrisy is a dispiriting act of silencing. For anyone who cares about fairness, it is a disgrace.Brian Rosenberg is the president of Macalester College.Advertisement"}

The views of Hillary Clinton voters have not changed appreciably over the last few weeks.Both Democrats and Republicans were more likely to report seeing negative news about the N.F.L. around the time of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks in Alabama and the protests that followed. But Trump voters were much more likely to do so, while respondents who said they voted for Mrs.  Clinton were more mixed in the coverage they reported seeing.A helpful way to consider Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. is to compare them with their views on other things. Every day, Morning Consult conducts large online surveys of about 5,000 adults in the United States, asking respondents their opinions about hundreds of brands and companies.Most of the time, ratings are consistent among people of different political parties. For example, Americans have favorable views of Oreos, Home Depot and Bed Bath & Beyond, regardless of who got their vote in 2016. (And, on the whole, both Trump and Clinton voters have slightly negative views of companies like Goldman Sachs and Philip Morris.)But a tiny fraction of these companies are divisive, with politics shaping how Americans perceive them. The N.F.L. has moved near the top of this list in recent weeks:The N.F.L. is now among the nation\u2019s most divisive brands, behind Trump Hotels and a handful of media companies, including The New York Times.But a lesson of outrage in 2017 is that its lifespan is always decreasing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Investor Tries to Shake Up Sina, a Pillar of China\u2019s Internet", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese internet boom has been good to Sina. Maybe, protests one of its American investors, it could have been better.Still, Sina finds itself embroiled in an unusual situation for a company with a surging stock price: a proxy fight. Aristeia Capital, a hedge fund based in Connecticut, is lobbying Sina shareholders to back its two candidates for the company\u2019s board in a bid to shake up Sina\u2019s business and give shareholders fatter returns. This week, the other shareholders will weigh in, casting their votes before a shareholder meeting set for Friday.Proxy fights in general are not uncommon, but one between a Chinese company and an American investor is the first of its kind, according to disclosures tracked by the data provider FactSet. And the campaign has helped to underscore the limits of foreign ownership of Chinese internet companies.Sina, one of the first Chinese tech companies to list its shares in New York, has called Aristeia \u201cself-serving\u201d and na\u00efve about how China\u2019s internet sector works.In turn, Aristeia, which manages $3 billion in investor money, has accused Sina of \u201cfailing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.\u201dForeign investors seem less than worried about any lack of control or lapses in corporate governance if the market is any indication. Shares in those companies have been on a tear in markets around the world as Chinese consumers reliably use their smartphones to buy electronics, shop for groceries, make investments, play games and look for dates.With more than 700 million users, China is the world\u2019s largest single internet market. Weibo has 313 million monthly average users.Still, some investors are quietly complaining about corporate governance practices.Chinese companies that list shares in the United States are not necessarily subject to American rules. Most are incorporated in light regulatory jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands.As a result, Chinese companies often behave differently. While Sina holds a regular annual meeting, some of its peers do not, a standard for the United States. Baidu, the search engine giant, has not held an annual shareholder meeting since 2008. JD.com, the online retailer, has never held one.\u201cInvestors have been getting a bit fed up with companies like Baidu and JD.com not having general meetings,\u201d said Jamie Allen, the secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association.A spokesman for JD.com said: \u201cInvestors appreciate our candor both on earnings calls and in engagement throughout the year. This issue has rarely, if ever, been raised to us.\u201d Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.Foreign investors also typically have fewer shareholder protections. To get around Chinese restrictions on outside investments in sensitive industries, many companies use a complicated legal structure, called a variable interest entity, or V.I.E. Under those arrangements, shareholders have rights to the profits of a company, but they do not control key assets \u2014 potentially leaving them exposed if the company runs into trouble or the Chinese government declares the structure illegal.Sina was a key player in the Chinese internet\u2019s emergence as a social and economic force. Its Weibo service, once derided by critics as a knockoff of Twitter, has grown in size and functionality to the point where it is now a must-read for many people.That separate listing helped set off the fight with Aristeia. Sina\u2019s shares have risen nearly 75 percent so far this year. But Weibo\u2019s performance has been better, with the stock more than doubling. Based on their stock market values, Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina \u2014 a gap that Aristeia says points to lackluster management and poor corporate governance.Sina uses a V.I.E. structure. Only one of the five director seats is available each year. The chairman and chief executive, Charles Chao, has a permanent position; the other members serve four-year terms.Aristeia is pushing for representation on the board so that directors will consider measures that would result in more money for shareholders. These include a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo or a buyback of shares by management.Sina says that any deal proposed by Aristeia would not clear because of China\u2019s complicated telecom and media rules. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, also owns a stake in Weibo, further complicating its options, Sina said.\u201cThe time, resources and capital invested to pursue a transaction with a high likelihood of failure, rather than accretive and value creating opportunities, is not in the best interests of Sina shareholders,\u201d Sina said in a statement.Some outsiders disagree. \u201cI think Sina has built in Weibo a very valuable asset that is not being reflected in its share price,\u201d said Randy Gelber, a managing director at UBS, the Swiss bank.\u201cIt would seem like there should be some common ground from both sides on how to realize that value,\u201d he said.Two proxy advisers \u2014 Glass Lewis & Company and International Shareholder Services \u2014 have given some weight to Aristeia\u2019s arguments. Glass Lewis recommended that Sina expand its board to allow Aristeia\u2019s nominees, and I.S.S. recommended that Sina shareholders support one of the two nominees.\u201cAn examination of the arguments reveals compelling reasons for shareholders to seek change at the company,\u201d I.S.S. said.It is also unfolding as the Chinese government looks to take a more active role in how its corporate giants are managed.Even if Aristeia emerges victorious, the real test could be whether its candidates will be able to push for change internally.\u201cThe question is whether that board member would be able to do anything other than jump up and down at meetings,\u201d said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management.videoAdvertisement"}

About 45 female and five male members spoke for one to two minutes each to a mostly empty auditorium.\u201cAt least one in every three women has been victim of some sort of physical or sexual violence,\u201d Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, said during the session. \u201cBut these statistics do not tell enough personal stories, and the reason we are debating this today is of course because of the global movement of #MeToo.\u201dSeveral lawmakers called for the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, which would require member states to adopt a comprehensive legal framework to combat violence against women. As of today, the convention has been ratified by only 15 of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states.Ms. Reintke demanded measures to \u201cimprove the mechanisms for fighting sexual harassment\u201d in the European Parliament after the \u201cshocking reports about the events\u201d there.Harassment has also been reported to be widespread throughout the European Union bureaucracy in Brussels, especially among junior assistants, interns and trainees. Such assistants usually have precarious work contracts, making them particularly vulnerable.After earning a degree in international affairs, Ms. Hutton said in an email, she was thrilled to land a six-month internship in Brussels at \u201cone of the top consultancies.\u201dBut in the course of her internship, she said, her supervisor began to behave in ways that made her increasingly uncomfortable.\u201cLewd sexual comments were made in meetings, over the company messenger and over Facebook,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would message me after midnight, extremely crude and disgustingly sexual things.

{"Headline": "Finding My Rosie the Riveter", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn March 15, I sat in a Cracker Barrel in Zionsville, Ind., a half-hour north of a factory in Indianapolis that was moving jobs to Mexico.I looked at the clock, worried that the steelworker I was supposed to meet for lunch \u2014 a woman named Shannon Mulcahy \u2014 wouldn\u2019t show.I had already interviewed half a dozen steelworkers who were losing their jobs down at the union hall. I learned a lot from them, but they were all men involved with the union who had refused to train their replacements from Mexico. I also wanted to get the perspective of someone who had agreed to train. I wanted to hear what it felt like to teach the person who would replace you.I had reached out on Facebook to a dozen people who had identified themselves as steelworkers at the plant. Shannon was the only one who wrote me back that same day.But then she canceled our lunch meeting abruptly. She feared that the Rexnord Corporation, the company that owned the factory, would punish her for talking to a reporter.I did my best to convince Shannon that I would protect her identity until she\u2019d received her final paycheck from the company. It was a risky promise. Nobody knew when that would be.\u201cI\u2019m a stranger and you have no reason to trust me,\u201d I wrote her on Facebook. \u201cBut I do want to tell the story of Rexnord and I want to tell it all the way through. I want to find out six months from now or even a year from now what happened to everybody. I want to follow certain people to see where they ended up. I\u2019d love for you to be one of them.\u201dLuckily, Shannon did walk through the door at Cracker Barrel, wearing her signature blue eyeliner. She sat down to lunch and told me the story of her life, which was unlike anything I had ever heard.It was a tale of overcoming sexual abuse and domestic violence to become the first female \u201cheat treat\u201d operator at the plant\u201a responsible for hardening with fire the small rings of steel that would eventually be joined together, one inside the other, to form bearings. Yet Shannon didn\u2019t view herself as a victim or a survivor. She was simply a single mom trying to make it.The reality that Shannon and her co-workers showed me flew in the face of so many assumptions I had about class, free trade and globalization.I had always been told that automation, not trade, was the reason factory workers like Shannon were losing their jobs. But the two are intimately linked, as U.S. factories trying to compete with cheap labor overseas are forced to automate to stay profitable. Far from seeing herself as a competitor to machines, Shannon viewed herself as a loving caretaker of the machines she\u2019d spent years learning to operate and repair.I had always been told by economists, diplomats and academics that workers like Shannon were the few who had to be sacrificed so that the rest of us could be better off: They were the martyrs of globalization. But the more I delved into economic theory, the more I began to question whether people like Shannon were really \u201cthe few.\u201d Our economy is designed for (and by) people with college degrees \u2014 a credential that two-thirds of American adults lack.For those of us who are lucky enough to have graduated from good colleges, globalization and unfettered trade have expanded our horizons and boosted our incomes, as the world opened up to our talent and capital. We rarely think about the downsides to our fellow Americans, the most vulnerable among us. Too often, we just repeat the ubiquitous platitude, \u201cThe factories are never coming back.\u201dGetting to know Shannon and her co-workers helped me understand why so many Americans feel let down by both major political parties in this country. But this story has also given me a huge amount of hope that, despite our many differences, Americans still really do care about one another.\u201cShannon, Rosie the Riveter has nothing on you,\u201d commented a woman from Vermont. \u201cIf ever we are to succeed as a country again, it is because of people like you. Your tenacity, grit, love, humanity, devotion to family and work ethic are what make America thrive.\u201dA man who identified himself as a former manager in tech manufacturing, from Dallas, wrote: \u201cI have seen this story play out over and over again. It is going to take a new breed of committed, smart and courageous leaders both political and in business to turn around this mess.\u201dA judge in California sent me a message saying that the story \u201caffirmed for me how we as Americans are all in this together and should behave that way more.\u201dAmen to that.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Heard of Tennessee Whiskey? Meet New York State Rye", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW PALTZ, N.Y. \u2014 Christopher Williams, intense, wild-eyed and with a face bracketed by a shaggy goatee and wire-rimmed glasses, looks more like a revolutionary than a whiskey distiller.Empire Rye \u2014 an appellation that requires, among other things, that distillers use New York State grain and age their whiskey for at least two years \u2014 represents a novel turn in American distilling. At a time when bourbon is made by small distillers in 48 states, Mr. Williams and his co-conspirators are betting that consumers will buy into the idea of a spirit distinguished by its regional pedigree, in the same way that millions of drinkers worldwide identify Jack Daniel\u2019s as Tennessee whiskey, or Ch\u00e2teau Latour as Bordeaux wine.\u201cMy vision is that bars and liquor stores and the public will see this as a mark of authenticity, and that as a category Empire Rye can be mentioned in the same sentence as Kentucky bourbon, Tennessee whiskey or Scotch,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who grows a significant amount of his own grain in the fields behind his distillery on the outskirts of this Hudson Valley college town.Empire Rye is a potential answer to a problem born of craft distilling\u2019s phenomenal success: Ten years ago there were about 100 companies making spirits in the United States; today there are nearly 1,400, according to the American Distilling Institute. \u201cYou have all these distilleries, all going the same way, so there\u2019s no touchstone,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cWhen you walk up to the craft shelf, you have no idea what to think about, what it means.\u201dAt the same time, craft distillers, like chefs, are thinking more about the sources of their raw ingredients, the stories behind what they\u2019re making and their relationships to their communities.That\u2019s why some of the country\u2019s more forward-thinking distillers are looking toward regionalization, creating new subspecies like Pacific Northwest single malts or mesquite-smoked whiskey in the Southwest.But no one has gone as far as the people behind Empire Rye.The discussion in Denver soon settled on the need for a distinguishing set of standards, a way to define New York rye and an incentive for other distillers to follow suit. \u201cWe shook hands, bleary-eyed, and decided to do something,\u201d Mr. Potter said.Before a distillery can put an official Empire Rye sticker on its label, its whiskey must meet four criteria. At least 75 percent of its grain must be New York-grown rye. It must be distilled to no more than 160 proof; put into a barrel at no more than 115 proof (which is below the industry standard of 125 proof); and aged at least two years in charred, new oak barrels.\u201cEvery distillery has a chance to hit the standards,\u201d Mr. Potter said, \u201cbut also to experiment.\u201dWhy rye? The distillers say that, for all its current cachet among bartenders and whiskey fans, rye remains largely unappreciated by most Americans, and thus especially ripe for innovation.Rye was once a dominant American spirit, especially on the East Coast, where the hardy grain grew better than corn or barley, and where many drinkers knew regional styles like Maryland Rye or Old Monongahela, from Pennsylvania, by name.But during Prohibition, Americans lost their taste for the spirit\u2019s robust, spicy notes, and until recently almost all rye was made in Kentucky, with barely enough of the grain to qualify. (By law, at least 51 percent of the grain in rye whiskey must be rye; the rest is usually corn.)\u201cA lot of knowledge was lost in Prohibition,\u201d said Jason Barrett, the head distiller and president of Black Button. \u201cIt set American whiskey back a hundred years.\u201dOver the last decade, American palates have once again embraced rye\u2019s strength, but the lack of variety in craft ryes leaves a door open for initiatives like Empire Rye.Matt Hofmann, the master distiller at Westland, has been working with university agriculture departments to identify barley varietals that will flourish in the Northwestern climate; he has also used a regional variety of oak, the Garry or Oregon white oak, to make barrels for aging.\u201cWe live in a time when you can make a good copy of anything anywhere,\u201d Mr. Hofmann said. \u201cBut the places I get excited about are the ones that aren\u2019t just copying, but taking the influence of what\u2019s around them and applying it to what they\u2019re doing.\u201dIn some cases, it\u2019s less a matter of innovating than excavating. Herman Mihalich, the founder of Mountain Laurel Spirits in Bristol, Pa., spent years researching the history of Old Monongahela, a style of rye once popular in the Mid-Atlantic states that largely disappeared after Prohibition.It remains to be seen whether consumers will take to the new regional styles. But the fact that regionalization is part of the conversation among craft distillers shows how far, and how rapidly, the industry has moved \u2014 and how far it wants to go.\u201cBourbon means something the world over,\u201d said Mr. Barrett, of Black Button. \u201cMy hope is that in 20 years people will say, \u2018Empire Rye, I know that, too.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of the craft-spirits conference where Empire Rye was conceived. It was Denver, not Washington D.C. The article also misspelled the surname of the master distiller at Westland Distillery in Seattle. He is Matt Hofmann, not Hoffman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "McCain in Twilight: An Unfettered Voice Against Trumpism", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain, the sometimes cantankerous, often charming and eternally irrepressible Republican from Arizona, has never minced words. But in the twilight of a long and storied career, as he fights a virulent form of brain cancer, the 81-year-old senator has found a new voice.In twin speeches \u2014 one in July, where he issued a call to bipartisanship in the Senate, and another in Philadelphia this past week, where he railed against \u201chalf-baked, spurious nationalism\u201d \u2014 Mr. McCain has taken on both his colleagues and President Trump. In the process, his friends and fellow senators say, he has carved out a new role for himself on Capitol Hill: elder statesman and truth-teller.\u201cEven if John were not ill, with his experience and age, there is a part of you that I think begins to focus on your legacy,\u201d said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a close friend of Mr. McCain\u2019s. But with cancer, Mr. Biden said, \u201che\u2019s in the fight of his life, and he knows it.\u201dHaving won re-election last year, Mr. McCain was already free to speak his mind. Were he to run again in 2022, he would be 86, and friends say that his 2016 campaign was almost certainly his last.But colleagues see a shift since his diagnosis.\u201cDo I hear in his voice a little bit more expression of grander ideals? I do,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cWith all that\u2019s happened to him, and the knowledge of where he is, I sense a little bit more of that.\u201dIn Philadelphia, the National Constitution Center awarded Mr. McCain its Liberty Medal, honoring his lifetime of public service. The senator\u2019s acceptance speech was a treatise on his expansive view of America\u2019s role in the world \u2014 a role that, he fears, is being diminished by Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201cThe international order we helped build from the ashes of world war, and that we defend to this day, has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history,\u201d Mr. McCain said.He went on to deplore as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d those who would \u201cabandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe,\u201d in favor of \u201csome half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.\u201dThe speech grew out of a book Mr. McCain is writing with Mark Salter, his longtime speechwriter and co-author. It was not aimed directly at Mr. Trump, Mr. Salter said, but at the philosophy of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, and his hard-charging right-wing website, Breitbart News.\u201cIn my view, and McCain\u2019s too, these guys at Breitbart are crackpots,\u201d Mr. Salter said.Another element of the speech \u2014 Mr. McCain\u2019s gratitude for a life well lived \u2014 was equally important to the senator, Mr. Salter added, but it got lost in the media frenzy around the address.Mr. Biden said he took the speech as a pointed message, if not to Mr. Trump, then to the nation. \u201cI think he was delivering a message to the country, to his colleagues and to any of the opinion makers that would listen, and that is, \u2018Look, this is serious stuff, our role in the world is not guaranteed, democracy is not guaranteed, we know how to do this and, damn it, we\u2019d better focus and know what\u2019s at stake.\u2019\u201dThe president, though, took it personally.\u201cPeople have to be careful, because at some point, I fight back,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m being nice. I\u2019m being very, very nice. But at some point, I fight back, and it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201dTo which Mr. McCain, a former Navy captain who was tortured during more than five years as a prisoner in Vietnam, shot back: \u201cI have faced tougher adversaries.\u201dMr. Biden found the tit-for-tat laughable. \u201cThe idea that Trump is going to intimidate John McCain? Give me a break,\u201d he said.Now, \u201cthere\u2019s not a relationship\u201d between the two men, said John Weaver, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McCain. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they had one that got soured, or they had one that has not improved. There is not one.\u201dIn a brief hallway conversation in a Capitol corridor this past week, Mr. McCain put it this way: \u201cI\u2019m doing what I think is right for the country. I don\u2019t work for Donald Trump, and I don\u2019t work for his administration.\u201dHe has turned his tongue on his colleagues as well. In July, in a dramatic return to Congress after surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye, he delivered a harsh critique of the Senate as he called for Democrats and Republicans to work together.\u201cWe\u2019ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues, because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle,\u201d Mr. McCain said.That speech was \u201cthe kind of speech one gives when they\u2019re leaving,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who has served for decades in the Senate with Mr. McCain. \u201cI think in many ways it was a catharsis for him, and I think that he doesn\u2019t know how much longer he has. I hope he has a long, long time. But I think he\u2019s decided, I\u2019m going to make every moment count.\u201dIf Mr. McCain views himself as a guardian of the Senate as an institution, it is perhaps because he practically grew up in the chamber.In 1977, four years after his release from the Vietnamese prison known as the Hanoi Hilton, the Navy assigned Mr. McCain to be its Senate liaison. He traveled around the world with lawmakers \u2014 including Mr. Biden, then a senator from Delaware \u2014 arranging their schedules and sometimes even carting their luggage.The reaction to his health care vote \u201csurprised him,\u201d Mr. Biden said, \u201chow much impact it had in giving courage to others of his own party.\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s speaking out on much broader issues,\u201d she said.As he walks the halls of the Capitol, often surrounded by reporters \u2014 he once famously referred to the news media as \u201cmy base\u201d \u2014 Mr. McCain is his usual irreverent, prickly self. To a reporter who missed his speech in July, he said wryly: \u201cIt was one of the great speeches ever given. People thought about William Jennings Bryan when they saw that speech.\u201dWhen a Fox News correspondent asked if he would oppose everything Mr. Trump asked him to do, the senator snapped, \u201cWhy would you say something that stupid?\u201dAsk how he is feeling, and he will issue a brusque reply \u2014 \u201cfine, fine, I\u2019m fine\u201d \u2014 before brushing aside further inquiry. But he has grown thinner in recent weeks, and sometimes looks fatigued. Those who know him well see the cancer treatment wearing on him. He is characteristically matter-of-fact about the future.Advertisement"}

They lived in the same town in North Korea, Hyesan, but never met there, and left under very different circumstances.We recently spoke to both students about their transition to New York from one of the world\u2019s most repressive governments.What about life in New York surprised you?\u201cI had seen paintings in school of Americans, with big noses, blue eyes, and they looked liked really evil monsters,\u201d Ms. Park said. \u201cI thought they were one race. But when I came to New York, people all look so different, and they are New Yorkers, they are Americans. It really touched me that this is a kind of dream place where we can all live peacefully.\u201d\u201cWhen I was in North Korea I watched a lot of anti-America propaganda documentaries and I have really powerful memories of the Statue of Liberty, of that women holding the torch, and of North Korea condemning it,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil recently, I saw it in a totally different context. Now, learning the history of so many people immigrating and coming to America to find freedom, it\u2019s a wonderful kind of thing.\u201dWhat should Americans know about life in North Korea?\u201cHave you ever seen the movie \u2018The Truman Show?\u2019\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s like that. No one tells you the truth and you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u201cThere are also people like me who have a business mind, or who don\u2019t rely on the government propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cThat social change is happening now in North Korea, but those changes are not yet strong enough to upset the system.\u201dHow can the situation in North Korea be improved?\u201cWithout China, there\u2019s no North Korea. There\u2019s no Kim,\u201d she said.\u201cThe real weapon of North Korea is the isolation of the people. The international community needs to find some way to engage with the North Korean people.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Fall days don\u2019t get much better than this.That\u2019s not all. A string of sunny and mild days will take us through the weekend.New Yorkers can see the work of North Korean artists this week.So the forum made the best of the situation and asked the three North Koreans to take photographs of cityscapes and museums in Beijing. They also asked a South Korean artist, Zaun Lee, to shoot similar spaces in London and Athens and a Chinese artist, Shen Yang, to snap the same in New York.\u201cThe North Koreans were very interested in children, monuments, and statues of powerful people,\u201d Mr. Hostetter said.The Chinese and South Korean artists expressed broader interests, Mr. Hostetter added. \u201cThey were more interested in architecture and ordinary people in the street.\u201dFor last Thursday\u2019s opening, diplomats from North Korea, South Korea and the United States were invited to attend.To Mr. Hostetter\u2019s surprise, representatives from both North and South Korea made appearances.\u201cBut they declined our offer to introduce them to each other,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Hostetter said, he has hope that the two sides will eventually meet.\u201cWe\u2019ll be trying again at the closing.\u201dThe free exhibition is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10 p.m. to 4 p.m. on the weekends.

{"Headline": "For Music Fans Drawn to Las Vegas, a Retreat Became a Trap", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe weekend was perfect for an escape. It was Las Vegas, the poster city for getting away, and a dazzling lineup of entertainment beckoned, a three-day country music festival known as Route 91.For the devoted, there was no other place to be last weekend, and they came from all over. They flew in from Toronto and Tennessee. They drove from New Mexico and California. Some had talked about the trip for months, counting down to it on their Facebook pages and gloating to friends about their plans.The victims were co-workers who did not know one another well, but had bonded over their love of country music. They were teachers, city employees, an off-duty police officer. They were childhood friends who had reunited for the concert and a mother of two who wanted to take a romantic weekend trip with her husband, leaving the children behind with their grandparents.One woman who was killed, Michelle Vo of the Los Angeles area, had recently ended a relationship and moved into her own apartment, reaching for independence, a friend said. She had taken up paddle boarding and golf; the weekend in Las Vegas was spent meeting new friends.\u201cShe was just starting her life,\u201d said a close friend, Casey Lubin, 32, a banker. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t understand how this could happen.\u201dFor some, the weekend in Las Vegas was both ritual and reward. Adrian Murfitt, a 35-year-old from Anchorage, had just spent a grueling summer working as a commercial fisherman. He had fond memories of attending the Route 91 festival last year, so he booked another trip to Las Vegas to congratulate himself for a summer\u2019s work well done.\u201cHe had such a great time when he went before, and he wanted to treat himself for a successful fishing season,\u201d said his sister, Shannon Gothard.For one couple, the Route 91 festival was a way of making amends. Chris Muniz of Gallup, N.M., forgot his wedding anniversary last year and decided to make it up to his wife, Lisa Romero-Muniz, with a road trip to Las Vegas. She was overjoyed, taking Friday and Monday off work for the long weekend, said Rosie Fernandez, her friend and supervisor at the high school where they worked.\u201cShe was beyond excited,\u201d Ms. Fernandez said. \u201cFor her husband to remember her anniversary and do all of that, this was a big thing for her.\u201dThe authorities have not yet identified all of the people who perished, but with 58 dead and about 500 others injured, the mass shooting on Sunday was one of the deadliest in American history. The notion that many had waited with such anticipation for the weekend \u2014 saving up extra money and days off from work to make it happen \u2014 made those memories all the more painful for grieving relatives.Susan Smith, 53, got permission to take Monday off from her job as an office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley, Calif., so that she could stay up late at the concert Sunday night with her friends. By Tuesday, students there were wearing red, white and blue to school in Ms. Smith\u2019s memory.Cameron Robinson, 28, had taken Monday off from his job as a management analyst for the city of Las Vegas to attend the festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley.The creator of a smartphone app that eased navigation for attendees of the city government\u2019s annual conferences, Mr. Robinson was a frequent volunteer at city events, and had been given a promotion last summer, according to Brad Jerbic, the city attorney and a family friend.\u201cThat\u2019s what he wanted most that weekend, to be with his boyfriend and to listen to country music,\u201d Mr. Jerbic said.Mr. Robinson was shot in the neck, Mr. Jerbic said. He died shortly after 10 p.m. on Sunday night, in Mr. Eardley\u2019s arms.The police in Las Vegas said there was no pattern to where the people who were fatally shot had been standing on the festival grounds when the gunfire broke out. To some survivors, there seemed to be a chilling randomness to where the shots fell. Nowhere seemed safe or certain.Brian MacKinnon, a friend of Mr. Murfitt\u2019s, was standing next to him when Mr. Murfitt was struck by a bullet. Another woman within arm\u2019s reach was shot in the head.

{"Headline": "Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies? Don\u2019t Bet on It", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. They\u2019re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won\u2019t.The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives \u2014 when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms \u2014 Americans turned to their government for a fix.Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants\u2019 power through government \u2014 and, if so, how.On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five \u2014 Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.But there is little to suggest we\u2019ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants\u2019 vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.\u201cIndividuals, lawmakers, we\u2019re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable \u2014 so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.\u201cOur firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cFolks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I\u2019d bet a lot of money a year from now we\u2019ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.\u201dPart of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we\u2019ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They\u2019re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five\u2019s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.\u201cWe\u2019ve all become a bit cyborg,\u201d writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d one of several new books examining the giants. \u201cWhat we need to always remember is that we\u2019re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.\u201dYet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it\u2019s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn\u2019t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn\u2019t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government\u2019s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company\u2019s culture \u2014 which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today\u2019s tech giants. But that\u2019s a big if.\u201cThe big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cHad we been more diligent, we wouldn\u2019t have nearly the problems we have today.\u201dFollow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Fiction Becomes Fact on Social Media", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMindHours after the Las Vegas massacre, Travis McKinney\u2019s Facebook feed was hit with a scattershot of conspiracy theories. The police were lying. There were multiple shooters in the hotel, not just one. The sheriff was covering for casino owners to preserve their business.The political rumors sprouted soon after, like digital weeds. The killer was anti-Trump, an \u201cantifa\u201d activist, said some; others made the opposite claim, that he was an alt-right terrorist. The two unsupported narratives ran into the usual stream of chatter, news and selfies.\u201cThis stuff was coming in from all over my network of 300 to 400\u201d friends and followers, said Mr. McKinney, 52, of Suffolk, Va., and some posts were from his inner circle.But he knew there was only one shooter; a handgun instructor and defense contractor, he had been listening to the police scanner in Las Vegas with an app. \u201cI jumped online and tried to counter some of this nonsense,\u201d he said.Agents with links to the Russian government set up an endless array of fake accounts and websites and purchased a slew of advertisements on Google and Facebook, spreading dubious claims that seemed intended to sow division all along the political spectrum \u2014 \u201ca cultural hack,\u201d in the words of one expert.Yet the psychology behind social media platforms \u2014 the dynamics that make them such powerful vectors of misinformation in the first place \u2014 is at least as important, experts say, especially for those who think they\u2019re immune to being duped. For all the suspicions about social media companies\u2019 motives and ethics, it is the interaction of the technology with our common, often subconscious psychological biases that makes so many of us vulnerable to misinformation, and this has largely escaped notice.Skepticism of online \u201cnews\u201d serves as a decent filter much of the time, but our innate biases allow it to be bypassed, researchers have found \u2014 especially when presented with the right kind of algorithmically selected \u201cmeme.\u201dAt a time when political misinformation is in ready supply, and in demand, \u201cFacebook, Google, and Twitter function as a distribution mechanism, a platform for circulating false information and helping find receptive audiences,\u201d said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College (and occasional contributor to The Times\u2019s Upshot column).For starters, said Colleen Seifert, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, \u201cPeople have a benevolent view of Facebook, for instance, as a curator, but in fact it does have a motive of its own. What it\u2019s actually doing is keeping your eyes on the site. It\u2019s curating news and information that will keep you watching.\u201dThat kind of curating acts as a fertile host for falsehoods by simultaneously engaging two predigital social-science standbys: the urban myth as \u201cmeme,\u201d or viral idea; and individual biases, the automatic, subconscious presumptions that color belief.The first process is largely data-driven, experts said, and built into social media algorithms. The wide circulation of bizarre, easily debunked rumors \u2014 so-called Pizzagate, for example, the canard that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from a Washington-area pizza parlor \u2014 is not entirely dependent on partisan fever (though that was its origin).For one, the common wisdom that these rumors gain circulation because most people conduct their digital lives in echo chambers or \u201cinformation cocoons\u201d is exaggerated, Dr. Nyhan said.In a forthcoming paper, Dr. Nyhan and colleagues review the relevant research, including analyses of partisan online news sites and Nielsen data, and find the opposite. Most people are more omnivorous than presumed; they are not confined in warm bubbles containing only agreeable outrage.But they don\u2019t have to be for fake news to spread fast, research also suggests. Social media algorithms function at one level like evolutionary selection: Most lies and false rumors go nowhere, but the rare ones with appealing urban-myth \u201cmutations\u201d find psychological traction, then go viral.There is no precise formula for such digital catnip. The point, experts said, is that the very absurdity of the Pizzagate lie could have boosted its early prominence, no matter the politics of those who shared it.\u201cMy experience is that once this stuff gets going, people just pass these stories on without even necessarily stopping to read them,\u201d Mr. McKinney said. \u201cThey\u2019re just participating in the conversation without stopping to look hard\u201d at the source.Digital social networks are \u201cdangerously effective at identifying memes that are well adapted to surviving, and these also tend to be the rumors and conspiracy theories that are hardest to correct,\u201d Dr. Nyhan said.One reason is the raw pace of digital information sharing, he said: \u201cThe networks make information run so fast that it outruns fact-checkers\u2019 ability to check it. Misinformation spreads widely before it can be downgraded in the algorithms.\u201dThe authors analyzed the news feeds of some 10 million users in the United States who posted their political views, and concluded that \u201cindividuals\u2019 choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure\u201d to contrary news and commentary than Facebook\u2019s own algorithmic ranking \u2014 which gauges how interesting stories are likely to be to individual users, based on data they have provided.Outside critics lashed the study as self-serving, while other researchers said the analysis was solid and without apparent bias.The other dynamic that works in favor of proliferating misinformation is not embedded in the software but in the biological hardware: the cognitive biases of the human brain.Purely from a psychological point of view, subtle individual biases are at least as important as rankings and choice when it comes to spreading bogus news or Russian hoaxes \u2014 like a false report of Muslim men in Michigan collecting welfare for multiple wives.Merely understanding what a news report or commentary is saying requires a temporary suspension of disbelief. Mentally, the reader must temporarily accept the stated \u201cfacts\u201d as possibly true. A cognitive connection is made automatically: Clinton-sex offender, Trump-Nazi, Muslim men-welfare.And refuting those false claims requires a person to first mentally articulate them, reinforcing a subconscious connection that lingers far longer than people presume.Over time, for many people, it is that false initial connection that stays the strongest, not the retractions or corrections: \u201cWas Obama a Muslim? I seem to remember that....\u201dIn a recent analysis of the biases that help spread misinformation, Dr. Seifert and co-authors named this and several other automatic cognitive connections that can buttress false information.Another is repetition: Merely seeing a news headline multiple times in a news feed makes it seem more credible before it is ever read carefully, even if it\u2019s a fake item being whipped around by friends as a joke.\u201cYour social alliances affect how you weight information,\u201d said Dr. Seifert. \u201cWe overweight information from people we know.\u201dThe casual, social, wisecracking nature of thumbing through and participating in the digital exchanges allows these biases to operate all but unchecked, Dr. Seifert said.Stopping to drill down and determine the true source of a foul-smelling story can be tricky, even for the motivated skeptic, and mentally it\u2019s hard work. Ideological leanings and viewing choices are conscious, downstream factors that come into play only after automatic cognitive biases have already had their way, abetted by the algorithms and social nature of digital interactions.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have direct evidence that all these theories were wrong\u201d from the scanner, Mr. McKinney said, \u201cI might have taken them a little more seriously.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Floyd Mayweather Helped Two Young Guys From Miami Get Rich", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "Celebrity endorsements are helping start-ups raise big money in so-called initial coin offerings. But it is not always clear what they are selling.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Floyd Mayweather, perhaps the greatest boxer of his generation, is not shy about using social media to display the wealth that his years of prize fighting have won him. On Facebook, you can find videos of Mr. Mayweather draped in diamond chains. Want to see him with blocks of $100 bills taped to his torso? There\u2019s that, too.Recently, Mr. Mayweather has shown his appreciation for a new kind of money. In September, he told his 13.5 million followers on Facebook not once but twice that they should buy a new virtual currency known as the Centra token.\u201cGet yours before they sell out,\u201d he wrote above a picture of himself admiring the many boxing title belts he had been awarded over the years. \u201cI got mine and as usual I\u2019m going to win big with this one!\u201dMr. Mayweather is among the many celebrities who have recently endorsed an initial coin offering, the name for a hot but loosely regulated new method of fund-raising in which entrepreneurs sell their own virtual currencies to investors around the world.The boxer\u2019s endorsement of Centra, along with a similar endorsement from the popular rapper DJ Khaled, lent a patina of credibility to a project that has ended up with more than a few problems, including a chief executive who does not appear to have been a real person and a shaky, fast-shifting business plan.Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centra\u2019s founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world. They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case.Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last year\u2019s total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings. Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months.Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens \u2014 Centra, Stox and Hubiits \u2014 has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather.But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs.\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies,\u201d said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology. \u201cBut I\u2019m not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects.\u201dThe original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token \u2014 with no physical backing \u2014 that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records.Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems. The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market. Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks \u2014 like the next generation of the internet.But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators.The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani. The company\u2019s chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well. Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build.\u201cCentra Tech has a brilliant solution, the world\u2019s first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets,\u201d the announcement said.Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time.Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the company\u2019s marketing material. The LinkedIn profile was deleted.The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president. The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums.\u201cWhen I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z,\u201d Mr. Sharma said in an interview.Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card. The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken. The company\u2019s site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo.There was one problem with this plan. The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said.After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website. Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution. He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards.But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed.\u201cCentra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved,\u201d Mr. Gendron said.Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the company\u2019s credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities. A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had.Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour. Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didn\u2019t own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent.The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla., who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month.\u201cHe stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came,\u201d Mr. Fern said. \u201cIt was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.\u201dMr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was \u201ca kid.\u201dHe said the landlord\u2019s statements were \u201cnot accurate.\u201dFor now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising.Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharma\u2019s trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment.\u201cAs defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite,\u201d the indictment said.Mr. Sharma said that he couldn\u2019t speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra.\u201cI\u2019m obviously not comfortable with that situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.\u201dHe and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather.Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami. Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centra\u2019s technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures.\u201cHe\u2019ll do anything we ask,\u201d Mr. Trapani said. \u201cHe\u2019ll go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.\u201dThe boxing champ understood their deal differently. A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra. She did not say how much he had been paid.After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post.Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweather\u2019s spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens. \u201cWe dealt with Floyd directly through my guy,\u201d Mr. Sharma said. \u201cIt was a very direct, individual deal.\u201dRepresentatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment.Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings.Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings. But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project \u2014 a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars.For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money.Assuming regulators don\u2019t step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don\u2019t build anything. But they say that won\u2019t happen.Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November. They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people.\u201cI see us taking over as being the No. 1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets,\u201d Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies. \u201cOnce our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.\u201dSome potential investors did not share Mr. Sharma\u2019s enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms. But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Bouley at Home, a Chef\u2019s Total Philosophy Under One Roof", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, while making his name serving haute cuisine and baking crusty breads, the chef David Bouley has also been exploring \u2014 through travels and research \u2014 how the pleasure of good food made with the right ingredients can benefit health.His latest project, Bouley at Home, provides a showcase for this approach to eating. There\u2019s a dining room with open kitchens, a food lab, a cooking school and a bake shop under one roof, with a catering hall sharing the premises.Bouley at Home, which opens Thursday in the Flatiron district, occupies about 1,600 square feet, with ovens and cabinets around the perimeter and three huge cooking stations combined with three dining counters in the center. There are just 24 seats for eight- to 10-course tasting menus for $225, not including beverages or tip.The cooks, led by Chris D\u2019Ambrosio, include Yoichi Akashi, who handles Japanese food; Etienne Le Bastard, the pastry chef; and Sarah Bouley, the chocolatier and Mr. Bouley\u2019s niece. All the cooks double as servers, communicating with the guests as much as possible.Adrien Falcon, who was the head sommelier at the elegant Bouley, which closed last summer, fills the same role here as well as manager. He has assembled a cellar that holds more bottles than the one at Bouley.Though the size of the space may suggest overkill for the number of seats, Mr. Bouley has taken a sharp pencil to the ledger. He has no waiters. At each seat is a drawer with silverware. (Help yourself, as at home.)He won\u2019t use online reservation services, saying they are too expensive and not responsive enough. Instead, he has set up his own ticketing system (like Tock, used by Eleven Madison Park) on his website for prepaid seats at eight time slots throughout the evening.

He delivers theories with zeal, along with a taste of something (French cultured butter, for example, or rosy Ib\u00e9rico ham) to prove a point about beneficial fats, salt with good minerals, fermentation, or the scandal of the sugary starches that are used in much of what\u2019s gluten-free.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to share my passion for how food tastes and the feelings it brings, and now I can share the science of food, too,\u201d he said.He has little use for much of what passes as \u201cwellness\u201d these days. To him, the term is as meaningless as calling foods natural.\u201cYoung people are so nervous about what to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an epidemic out there of intolerances,\u201d referring to allergies and autoimmune and digestive problems, among other ailments. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that in the old days, in France where my uncles live, and it doesn\u2019t have to be like that today.\u201dHe is evangelical about what he calls the \u201cliving pantry,\u201d the real, seasonal foods devoid of industrial processing that are part of his teaching.Soon, near the entrance of Bouley at Home, he will open a bakery selling fresh-baked breads.

{"Headline": "A Providence Chef Has Connections at the Docks", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review13 PhotosBut I gave it a shot, and it was great: sliced cold and neatly fanned out like sashimi, then sprinkled with olive oil and salt and pickled garlic-chive buds, the bluefish was chewy and soft at the same time, somehow, and had a rich, oily flavor that was especially delicious because I knew that in 24 hours it would taste half as good and a day after that it wouldn\u2019t be worth eating at all.His shopping list got longer when he opened Oberlin a few blocks away early last year. Fish isn\u2019t the only thing on the menu here, but there is a lot of it, and the ways Mr. Sukle uses it illustrate the exploration of local ingredients that makes Oberlin the most rewarding new restaurant I know of in Southern New England.The menu starts with a long list of raw seafood that is a snapshot of what\u2019s swimming around Rhode Island at the moment. \u201cWhen I go to the docks I\u2019m not just picking the best of the catch,\u201d Mr. Sukle said. \u201cIt\u2019s all great.\u201dI last ate there in the middle of September, when the raw fish included bonito and bigeye tuna, striped bass, mahi-mahi, both Spanish and Boston mackerel, and scup. A week or so later, the final gasps of a hurricane had chased the fish away, and Oberlin\u2019s raw bar was down to a dish dreamed up in the last hurricane season, mussels marinated in their steaming juices and a slug of aioli. Slightly rich and spicy under crunchy little sweet-potato chips, it is a terrific thing to eat even with plenty of fish around.Buying whole fish instead of fillets helps Mr. Sukle, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Heidi, keep prices down and the menu varied. I loved Oberlin\u2019s shiny, alluringly pasty brandade, made not with cod but with salted remnants of more abundant white-fleshed fish such as scup, mahi-mahi and fluke. It is served with a green splash of herbed olive oil on top and lightly toasted slices of the restaurant\u2019s excellent sourdough on the side.Salty pink hunks of cured bigeye tasted like the canned tuna of my dreams, alongside cucumbers and explosively ripe heirloom tomatoes seasoned with basil, wild mint and seaweed.Cured local bluefish stands in for imported anchovies in a bracingly original interpretation of puttanesca sauce in which the flavor of each ingredient \u2014 garlic and tomato and chiles and bluefish and razor-thin shavings of green olives \u2014 was clear and distinct.Birch is the smaller, tidier and quieter of Mr. Sukle\u2019s restaurants. Lamb pelts thrown over the backs of high leather-upholstered seats project a studied cool borrowed from Scandinavia. The handmade ceramics are plated with more delicate precision. Greater subtlety is drawn out of, or spirited into, the ingredients.There were delicious surprises in everything I tasted, and the set price of $55 for four painstaking courses was remarkably fair. When I ate there, charred cucumbers dressed with pistachio butter lurked below a translucent shingling of marinated cucumber. Airy fronds of fennel and a single preserved beach-rose petal had been airlifted into place on top.Mr. Sukle took Mr. Redzepi\u2019s teachings the right way. Edible discoveries get slightly more play at Birch, but the next time I\u2019m set loose in Providence for a night, odds are my feet will carry me to Oberlin. I like the friendly spontaneity of the dining-room crew. They\u2019re busier and can be harder to flag down than the staff at Birch, but once you have their attention they seem more engaged.Seating is in a rhythmic hodgepodge: high tables and bar stools to the right, regular tables to the left and out on the sidewalk, and a few wooden stools at the short counter facing the cooks who put together salads and slice raw fish under a sign that reads, \u201cTime flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.\u201d (An absurdist streak is one of Providence\u2019s underappreciated charms.)Then I would get down to business, starting with raw fish, of course. A submerged Italian theme surfaces on the menu from time to time. My experience with Oberlin\u2019s handmade pastas, though, was patchy. The filled pastas I ordered were not very good; both the duck inside triangular pansotti and the pork folded into doughy ravioli were dry and a little severe. But then there was that inspired puttanesca tossed with fusilli, and some wonderful potato gnocchi that were browned on one side and stirred into a buttery clam broth with tender littlenecks.Most nights see two whole, bone-in fish on the menu, one grilled and the other roasted. I\u2019ve had yellowtail flounder and Boston mackerel, and both were cooked just the way they should be, with a hint of pink along the spine.The same two desserts were offered each time I went. One was a rustic blueberry tart that was slightly underbaked on a first encounter and perfect the second time around. The other was a peach-blossom custard topped with fresh fruit. The custard had the fluffiness of a soft meringue. It was, in fact, a panna cotta infused with flowers that were preserved just like the rose petals and then frothed with a nitrous oxide canister. It was studiously put together but easy to like, which come to think of it is not a bad description of Oberlin itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if Platforms Like Facebook Are Too Big to Regulate?", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyBut in larger markets with bigger taxi companies, municipal governments bristle at the company\u2019s deep, evident disdain for their authority \u2014 and they\u2019re capable of striking back. Last month, in a sudden show of force, London told Uber that its license to operate in the city wouldn\u2019t be renewed. The city\u2019s transit authority cited a number of reasons for its actions: Uber\u2019s approach to reporting crimes; its background-check policies; its aggressive attempts to thwart regulators; general appeals to \u201cpublic safety\u201d and \u201ccorporate responsibility.\u201dLondon\u2019s threat to Uber is clearly existential: Being shut out of one of its largest markets is terrible for business and sets a dangerous precedent for the company as it tries to expand around the globe. But governments similarly perceive, in Uber, a broader challenge to their legitimacy. Uber doesn\u2019t so much do business in cities as unilaterally install itself as infrastructure. Its incompatibilities with local regulations or national employment law are presented as neither features nor bugs but as evidence of evolution and progress. It identifies, vets and credentials drivers. It fields complaints and arbitrates disputes, exercising authority over those it deems bad actors. It lets riders rate drivers and vice versa, creating a sort of customer-service-centric accountability. Because Uber purports to be self-regulating, its users and drivers share in the company\u2019s feeling that outside interference is unwelcome and even unnatural. It now has a constituency, hundreds of thousands strong, angry with their government on behalf of a corporation.Facebook had recently disclosed that it believed Russian state actors purchased political ads during the 2016 election; more broadly, it had been accused of allowing disinformation and misinformation to thrive on its platform. Among the measures that Zuckerberg said his company would take included expanding \u201cpartnerships\u201d with election commissions around the world and \u201cworking proactively to strengthen the democratic process.\u201d Most striking, coming from the C.E.O. of a publicly traded American social-media company, was this line: \u201cWe have been working to ensure the integrity of the German elections this weekend.\u201dSocial-media companies aren\u2019t new to defending themselves in ideological terms \u2014 they\u2019re just not used to doing it on their home turf. While to authoritarian regimes, the threat of social media is obvious, in the United States, Facebook, Twitter and Google have for years talked about themselves freely in the language of democracy, participation and connectivity. The emerging tension between internet platforms and democratic governments, however, seems to stem less from their obvious rhetorical differences than from their similarities.The problem was that Facebook had outgrown every context except its own. Though it neither thinks like nor resembles a government, it has effectively sewn itself into the fabric of users\u2019 public and personal lives. Facebook accounts have now become something like IDs, enabling an ever-growing range of activities: commerce, job-seeking, leisure. Networks stand in for community; encryption, in owned and operated services like WhatsApp, stands in for guarantees of liberty; newsfeeds become sources of diverse information, including ads, yes, but also calls to register to vote \u2014 to apply elsewhere what you\u2019ve increasingly experienced online.It\u2019s very likely that any approach to regulating Facebook will look more like diplomacy than anything else \u2014 a cautious search for d\u00e9tente with an institution that ultimately gets to set its own laws, whether a government likes it or not. Indeed, the company has been presenting itself as a willing, generous participant in American investigations, but more generally as a supranational, self-regulating force for good, and, boldly, as indispensable for the continuation of democracy around the world. \u201cWe will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world,\u201d Zuckerberg said, \u201cbut also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere.\u201d For citizen users, it\u2019s a gesture of good faith. To skeptical countries, it\u2019s a gentle declaration of independence, or maybe a dare. For Facebook, it\u2019s something distinct, new and unmistakably statelike: a claim of sovereignty.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Tasty \u201cpresents cooking from the point of view of the cook,\u201d said Andrew Gauthier, BuzzFeed\u2019s head of global strategic projects.That means keeping hands manicured and clean, but also avoiding distracting details like longer nails and intricate polish. \u201cIt triggers different people in different ways,\u201d Mr. Loitsch said. Because the hands are stand-ins for the viewer, any flair can feel alienating. One recent Tasty commenter was set off by a bracelet: \u201cUGH!

A hand reaching down from above \u201cfeels disembodied, like someone is making it for you,\u201d he said, but if it arises from below, \u201cthe hands become proxies for your hands.\u201dElsewhere on the internet, video makers are working in the opposite direction, imbuing the otherwise anonymous hand with personality and character through tiny, ornate decorations. The blankness of the hand \u2013 the same dynamic that makes a Tasty producer\u2019s bracelet a distraction \u2014 can be used to build a particular hand\u2019s brand.

Just as Instagram selfies have placed a spotlight on the assets of models and celebrities, and subjected all women to a kind of internet-wide beauty competition, nail art eliminates the distractions of the face and body, focusing instead on pure artistry and immaculate detail.If the face has come to represent narcissism online, directing human energies into beautified selfies and funneling issues through the personal testimonies of YouTube personalities, the hand projects a quiet seriousness of purpose. In an online landscape of endless chatter, it\u2019s all business.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.K. Lawmakers Ask Facebook About Russian Influence in Brexit Vote", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Parliament is asking Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies for information about Russian efforts to use social media to influence the British vote to leave the European Union, expanding on several parallel American congressional investigations around the election of President Trump.The British inquiry adds to the mounting pressure for more disclosure from the internet giants, which have already acknowledged broad Russian efforts to influence national elections in both the United States and France.Any indication of Russian meddling in the British vote last year to leave the European Union could raise doubts about the integrity of the outcome, further complicating the already vexed domestic politics surrounding the departure, commonly called Brexit.The Kremlin, which has long viewed the European Union as a threat, had a strong interest in promoting the groups that favored Britain\u2019s leaving the bloc. And the most visible tools of Russian propaganda, like the English-language broadcaster RT and the news agency Sputnik, heavily supported the initiative. The leave camp won with 52 percent of ballots cast, about 1.3 million more votes than the remain side drew.\u201cAny interference in the democratic process of the United Kingdom by people acting illegitimately is a serious matter,\u201d Damian Collins, a Conservative who heads a parliamentary committee leading an inquiry into \u201cfake news,\u201d wrote in a letter released on Tuesday that requested information from Twitter.A spokesman for Facebook said the company would respond \u201conce we have had the opportunity to review the request.\u201dA spokesman for Twitter declined to comment, but said in an email that the company was adapting to \u201cpatterns of malicious activity\u201d and now catches more than 3.2 million suspicious accounts each week. The company says that is more than twice what it detected each week last year, in the period before the Brexit referendum. It was unclear how much of that difference was attributable to better detection and how much to a growing number of suspect accounts.Facebook has acknowledged that Russian agents covertly bought advertising on its platform in an effort to swing the 2016 presidential election in favor of Mr. Trump. The company said in September that it was turning over more than 3,000 Russian-linked ads to congressional committees investigating interference in the race. Some of the Russian-linked content sought to influence the election obliquely, by inflaming social issues or racial tensions.\u201cIt is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation-states attempting to subvert elections,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are committed to rising to the occasion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "N.F.L. Players May Have an Ally in Their Protests: Labor Law", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs National Football League team owners consider President Trump\u2019s call to fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, they have stumbled into one of the most consequential debates in today\u2019s workplace: How far can workers go in banding together to address problems related to their employment?In principle, the answer in the N.F.L. and elsewhere may be: Quite far.To the extent that most people think about the reach of federal labor law, they probably imagine a union context \u2014 like organizing workers, or bargaining as a group across the table from management.As it happens, the law is much more expansive, protecting any \u201cconcerted activities\u201d that employees engage in to support one another in the workplace, whether or not a union is involved. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have defined such activity to include everything from airing complaints about one\u2019s boss through social media to publicly supporting political causes that have some bearing on one\u2019s work life.The league\u2019s operations manual says players must be on the sidelines during the anthem and should stand. While the law might not bear on whether an individual player can kneel during the anthem, many experts say it could protect players from repercussions for making such a gesture together \u2014 or taking other action \u2014 to show solidarity on the job.And as unionization continues its decades-long decline, some believe that these alternative forms of taking collective action may be crucial to enabling workers to speak up.\u201cWorkers without a traditional organization that is meant to protect them at work are kind of scrambling around for new ways of protecting themselves,\u201d said Benjamin Sachs, a labor law professor at Harvard University. \u201cIt does feel like these are nascent forms of something new.\u201dTo be protected under federal labor law, an employee\u2019s action must be conducted in concert with co-workers, it must address an issue of relevance to their job, and it must be carried out using appropriate means. Workers can\u2019t, say, damage property or threaten violence. (If the workers have a collective bargaining agreement with their employer that forbids certain actions \u2014 like striking \u2014 they can\u2019t do that, either.)Many experts believe that some of the recent protests by N.F.L. players meet all three conditions, and that as a result, their teams cannot discipline or fire them for taking part.More recently, the Obama-era labor board appeared to bless a relatively informal definition of the term \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d so that spontaneous banter, and not just well-orchestrated action like a formal protest, could qualify as protected.Together, said Matthew Bodie, a law professor at St. Louis University who is a former attorney for the labor board, these precedents suggest that federal labor law would most likely protect collective protests of the president\u2019s argument that players should be fired over political gestures \u2014 or his suggestion that league rules designed to protect players from debilitating injury are too strict.Mr. Bodie added that a player was also likely to enjoy federal protection for any protest in support of other players who had been disciplined.\u201cIf they\u2019re standing up for other players\u2019 rights to kneel in the context of their job and keep their job, it seems to me to be protected concerted activity,\u201d Mr. Bodie said.Michael J. Lotito, a lawyer with the management-side firm Littler Mendelson, agreed that players who protested Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to stifle their colleagues\u2019 political gestures could be engaging in protected activity. But he argued that under the law, which he said the Obama-era labor board had interpreted too broadly, the activity would have to entail more than kneeling during the national anthem.He said players would need a more overt connection to their cause, like passing out, to other players, fliers that took issue with the president\u2019s meddling in their workplace.Mr. Lotito also said the players\u2019 collective bargaining agreement with the owners could lawfully prohibit these sorts of protests. But Michael LeRoy, who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois, said the league\u2019s bargaining agreement was somewhat ambiguous on the question of protests with a political dimension.The N.F.L. and its players association did not respond to requests for comment.Experts said the \u201cconcerted activity\u201d right could be even more profound in workplaces, unlike the N.F.L., where employees aren\u2019t unionized and, therefore, have fewer tools for challenging their employers.\u201cPeople naturally have complaints, and they don\u2019t go away just because you kill unions,\u201d said Wilma B. Liebman, a former chairwoman of the labor board during the Obama administration.With a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and a Republican majority on the labor board, federal law is likely to move in this direction.Even so, there is probably no reversing the trend of employees\u2019 piping up en masse in the workplace. \u201cPeople\u2019s instinct, whether you know the word \u2018solidarity\u2019 or not, is to look for people to join you,\u201d said Ms. Liebman, the former board chairman. \u201cThe growth of social media, Twitter, different avenues for expressing solidarity, is kind of remarkable.\u201dKen Belson and Adam Liptak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Federal Doma Cafe in Federal, New South Wales", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare8 PhotosFEDERAL, New South Wales \u2014 To get to Federal Doma Cafe from the New South Wales coastline, you cross the Pacific Highway and turn onto Possum Shoot Road, which twists and turns up the side of a dramatic hill into the hinterlands above Byron Bay. The road is narrow, there are no guard rails protecting you from the sheer drops into the valley and the locals drive at crazy speeds.But the slight terror inherent in learning the sharp curves of these hills is entirely worthwhile, for the breathtaking scenery \u2014 banks of wildflowers, tunnels of trees, the green landscape stretching toward the blue ocean and the lighthouse that marks Australia\u2019s easternmost point \u2014 and for what awaits you at the top of the hill, which is surprising in almost every way.Federal, New South Wales, is a town of approximately 700 residents, and its main drag holds a tiny collection of businesses: an aged general store (which also doubles as the post office and bottle shop), a coffee shop, a caravan (in American parlance, a camper trailer) that has been retrofitted to serve Mediterranean food, and Doma Cafe.The cafe\u2019s wooden-slatted building is surrounded by weathered seating, as well as raised garden beds with wild overgrown herbs, tomatoes, and tiny pansies that decorate the desserts sold inside. Chickens wander among the tables with entitled beady stares, begging for scraps. Inside, up some ramshackle steps, a line of customers forms early at lunchtime to order at the counter and take a number. If they get there after noon they\u2019ll spend some time outside hovering until one of the tables or benches is vacated. (A park across the street provides some needed extra seating.)Sushi is available at lunch as prepackaged rolls to go, daily specials listed on a blackboard and freshly made hand rolls. The most economical tactic is to order one or two of the rolls from the short menu beside the cash register, but you\u2019ll miss out on the gorgeous salads that accompany the special roll of the day.The salads here might be punctuated with pink peppercorns, or pepitas, or thin threads that resemble saffron but are actually dehydrated red peppers of varying degrees of spiciness. Tasmanian sea trout sashimi comes fanned out in sweet, pinkish-orange buttery slivers under a mound of greens, herbs and flowers. The impossibly tender beef filet is nestled among one of these kaleidoscopic salads, the meat kissed with yuzu and fresh coriander, as is the eggplant dengaku, which is cooked to a puddinglike fudge along with sweet white miso and served over organic quinoa. If this sounds a little like the gluten-free grain bowls in high demand down the hill in Byron, that\u2019s exactly what it is, upgraded considerably by a dose of deft Japanese technique and flavor.The short list of burgers here has influences beyond Japan, with extras like Greek halloumi cheese or a sauce made from Spanish-smoked paprika. The patties are shot through with fennel and coriander, and that halloumi burger also sports korokke, a crispy potato patty described on the menu as a Japanese hash brown.Customers are mainly locals \u2014 the restaurant has no website; no one else would know to make the drive up here \u2014 but that \u201clocal\u201d designation has wide meaning. This part of the world still has a true rural Australian soul, but it now has some of the highest property values in the country, thanks mainly to its proximity to Byron Bay (a former hippie mecca that has morphed into a playground for the moneyed boho set). The customers sitting on the worn wooden benches in Doma\u2019s yard range from newcomers wearing designer linen caftans \u2014 colored to match their designer dogs \u2014 to tradespeople in dusty boots on their lunch break. If there\u2019s a tension between the two types of locals, it feels easy here among the chickens and flowers.At breakfast, there are egg and bacon sandwiches, very good espresso drinks and breakfast sushi hand rolls. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a Japanese hash brown tastes like when rolled up in nori, here\u2019s your chance. (Answer: silly, salty, a little unnecessary, but fun above all else.) The Doma Brekkie is a huge plate of creamy scrambled eggs, a pile of bacon, alarmingly red tomato slices, avocado, sweet onion relish, and sourdough or Japanese brown rice.In so many ways, Doma is an exemplar of the great Australian cafe \u2014 international in its scope, wonderfully casual, but blessed with quality and creativity worthy of fine dining. There\u2019s even avocado toast at breakfast. Of course there is.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Russian agents intending to sow discord among American citizens disseminated inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google\u2019s YouTube service, according to copies of prepared remarks from the companies that were obtained by The New York Times.The detailed disclosures, sent to Congress on Monday by companies whose products are among the most widely used on the internet, came before a series of congressional hearings this week into how third parties used social networks and online services to influence millions of Americans before the 2016 presidential election.In its prepared remarks sent to Congress, Facebook said the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin, had posted roughly 80,000 pieces of divisive content that was shown to about 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017. Those posts were then liked, shared and followed by others, spreading the messages to tens of millions more people. Facebook also said it had found and deleted more than 170 accounts on its photo-sharing app Instagram; those accounts had posted about 120,000 pieces of Russia-linked content.Facebook, Mr. Stretch said, was \u201cdetermined to prevent it from happening again.\u201dThe new information also illuminated when Facebook knew there had been Russian interference on its platform. Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations.Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users\u2019 News Feeds everyday. Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook.Twitter, in its prepared remarks, said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts on its service that were linked to the Internet Research Agency between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts, which Twitter has suspended, posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period.Outside of the activity of the Internet Research Agency, Twitter identified more than 36,000 automated accounts that posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that three-month period. The tweets received approximately 288 million views, according to the company\u2019s remarks.Twitter noted that the 1.4 million Russia-linked election tweets represented less than three-quarters of one percent of all election-related tweets during that period.Google, in its prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria.Google said it had found 18 channels that were \u201clikely associated\u201d with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube. All told, those accounts \u2014 now suspended \u2014 uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017. Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts that added up to 309,000 views between the middle of 2015 and late 2016. Only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers, the company said.Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those were not related to the Kremlin.\u201cWhile we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable,\u201d wrote Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel. The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity \u2014 or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such \u2014 as a reason for taking down the accounts.Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill. Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network.The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures. Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate. The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year.Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads. The company is working to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Google\u2019s AdWords \u2014 for example, web search ads \u2014 and YouTube. Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad.Mike Isaac reported from Washington and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Andrew spent Sunday in Dhahran taping a television interview for CNBC at Saudi Aramco\u2019s headquarters with its C.E.O. ahead of the kingdom\u2019s Future of Finance Initiative \u2014 known informally as Davos in the Desert \u2014 that starts Tuesday morning. Throughout the week, we\u2019ll bring you all the back-room chatter and details about an Aramco I.P.O.But the question the Saudi oil giant has been careful to avoid answering is: Where will that offering take place?Amin Nasser, the oil giant\u2019s chief executive, told Andrew that the listing remained on track and denied reports that it could be delayed or shelved in favor of selling private shares.\u201cWe have always said that we will be listing in 2018, and to be more specific, in the second half of 2018. However, I think journalists and writers \u2014 they are expecting more and more information, and we are governed by, you know, certain rules with regard to talking about the I.P.O. and all of that.\u201dNote that Mr. Nasser doesn\u2019t mention whether both parts of a potential Aramco I.P.O. \u2014 listings on both Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul exchange and on an international stock market like the N.Y.S.E. or the London Stock Exchange \u2014 are on track. He also denied that the company was talking with Chinese investors about a private placement. But do remember to parse those remarks: It is possible that the kingdom, not the company, would negotiate with the Chinese or others.For the betting types, here\u2019s what Mr. Trump told Maria Bartiromo: \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing a number of people and most people are saying it\u2019s down to two, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Powell. I also met with Janet Yellen, who I like a lot.\u201dThat may mean that John B. Taylor of Stanford University, who reportedly has the backing of Mike Pence, is the interest rate hawk more likely than Mr. Warsh to be nominated.For a plan that White House officials publicly hope can be passed by year\u2019s end, the proposed Republican tax overhaul still seems awfully in flux.

From the NYT:Asked about the allegation of a nonconsensual sexual relationship, a representative for Mr. O\u2019Reilly, Mark Fabiani, said that 21st Century Fox was \u201cwell aware\u201d Ms. Wiehl had signed a sworn affidavit \u201crenouncing all allegations against him,\u201d adding that after receiving the document Fox News offered Mr. O\u2019Reilly \u201ca record-breaking contract.\u201dAnd then there was FidelityBrian Hogan, president of Fidelity\u2019s stock-picking division, held an emergency meeting to stress the firm\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy.\u201d From the WSJ:The issue of workplace conduct has been simmering within Fidelity\u2019s stock-picking unit in particular for years.

{"Headline": "A Times Correspondent Describes Meeting ISIS Militants in Iraq", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHome LeaveRod Nordland, The New York Times\u2019s International correspondent at large, first went to Iraq in the 1980s, during the Iran-Iraq war. In the years since, including several as a correspondent for The Times in Baghdad, Mr. Nordland has covered the complex political and social currents of a nation seemingly in perpetual turmoil.Mr. Nordland, who had been visiting The Times in New York City during his scheduled \u201chome leave,\u201d spoke with Herbert Buchsbaum, The Times\u2019s Middle East editor, while viewers submitted questions for Mr. Nordland about his career. Here are edited excerpts from the Facebook Live broadcast.Were you afraid?He was unarmed and his hands were tied behind his back, yet even so, we\u2019ve been nurtured on this image of the ISIS boogeyman, and I think it affects all of us \u2014 aside from his physical presence, just the idea of what these people had been capable of. But the more I talked to him, the more that went away. I had that impression with a lot of the guys I talked to. They start out kind of scary-looking, but once you talk to them you reduce them to just another person.It was just dawning on them that what was going to happen to them was that they were going to a court, and probably to jail for having been in ISIS. And this guy was concerned. His wife was very pregnant, about to have their first child, and he realized in the course of my talking to him that he was not going to see his wife. He was pretty beaten down by that. So he has some human feelings after all.They\u2019re human beings \u2014 human beings that took an ugly path, but still human beings.The question I think a lot of people have is: Is ISIS finished? Are we seeing the end of them?I think, in some ways, yes. The ISIS prisoners we talked to said they had been ordered by their leaders to surrender themselves and to escape. They were also very bitter and their morale was at a real low point. They felt that they had been betrayed by ISIS leadership, that their leaders were just saving themselves and that the whole organization was finished. And it\u2019s true that they have basically lost all their important territory.But, they started out as an underground organization, and there\u2019s every reason to believe that they\u2019ll continue in that capacity. They still have a lot of ability to wreak havoc in that form.Why are there so few news organizations in Iraq and Syria? Did you see reporters from other organizations there?It was a fairly large media presence. But it\u2019s expensive to cover wars \u2014 especially to do it in a conscientious way, in which you take a lot of precautions. A freelancer who, for instance, went to Kurdistan would find himself facing fixer/translator fees of $500 a day typically. A driver would cost maybe $200 a day. And if you\u2019re going for anybody on assignment they should be providing you with some sort of security. And that\u2019s very expensive. That can be as much as $1,000 a day from some companies.Do you travel with armed guards?We don\u2019t usually. In general, the principle that most journalists follow is that the lower your profile, the safer you are. In Afghanistan, where I work a lot, there are typically embassies and international organizations that move around in armored car convoys. We never do that because when you move like that, you\u2019re making yourself a target. You can protect yourself against gunshots, but gunshots are not what we\u2019re worried about these days. It\u2019s bombs. Roadside bombs. And no amount of armor is going to protect you much against those.When you\u2019re in a place like Iraq, in a war zone for weeks at a time, is there stuff that you miss?Nowadays we can pretty much get everything everywhere. Like in Kurdistan, one night a couple of us were sitting around and said \u201cLet\u2019s go to the movies.\u201d So we went to the mall with a multiplex with 15 screens and we watched a movie. \u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Doesn\u2019t Like Being First?", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrowsingHere\u2019s how to get a jump on next season\u2019s trends right now.It\u2019s good to be ahead of the curve, especially when it comes to fashion. The spring 2018 collections, fresh off the runways, offered a little something for everyone. Provocateurs may gravitate toward the completely sheer (at Sonia Rykiel) or fringe laden (Calvin Klein); pragmatists will appreciate the abundance of blazers (Balenciaga), anoraks (Public School) and trench coats (Margiela). There were also some surprises: Bicycle shorts, which haven\u2019t seen the light of the runway in some time, showed up at Dolce & Gabbana, Off-White and Saint Laurent, a welcome addition for the shorts lover who\u2019s after more coverage but doesn\u2019t exactly yearn for baggy Bermudas. Here, a look at some of the trends \u2014 and how to wear them now.Blame it on the millennials: What began with that ubiquitous shade of \u201cmillennial pink\u201d has inspired a taste for something sweet elsewhere in the spectrum. Baby blues, yellows and, of course, candy-coated pinks appeared in head-to-toe looks at Versace, Michael Kors and Herm\u00e8s. In outerwear and knits, this typical springtime shade feels particularly fresh, and tempers a dark winter wardrobe.In the age of oversharing, there\u2019s no longer such a thing as TMI, even, or especially, as it applies to your wardrobe. The urge to bare, whether it\u2019s seen as refreshingly upfront or hopelessly narcissistic, was on display in the sheer looks at Dolce & Gabbana, Emilia Wickstead and Sonia Rykiel. Shy souls can dip their toes in the trend with tulle socks, while bolder sorts can layer a long-sleeve mesh turtleneck underneath a blouse or tee. If you opt to wear a sheer garment on its own, don\u2019t forgo the underwear. Freeing the nipple is best left on Instagram.As we careen steadily closer to a future of driverless cars and A.I. bots, fashion seems nostalgic for simpler times. In a mass-produced world, it\u2019s the homespun and handcrafted that have started to feel like the ultimate luxury \u2014 beautifully illustrated by J. W. Anderson\u2019s fall offerings, which combine granny-approved quilt patterns and contemporary shapes.What\u2019s that about if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it? This season, designers adhered to a new adage: If it ain\u2019t broke \u2026 break it. At Margiela, Balenciaga and Loewe, the classic trench was contorted, twisted and shredded in new ways. In the real world, the stores are offering less inventive tweaks to the standard khaki design, but they\u2019re far more wearable. The best way to wear them now? With everything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bowing to the Inevitable, Advertisers Embrace Advocate Role", "Date": "2017-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, advertisers have striven to stay away from any topic that might prove controversial or divisive. Times have changed.That was a recurring theme during the recently concluded Advertising Week New York, an annual industry conference in Manhattan that has turned into its own global enterprise. (Next year, regional versions of the event will be held in Mexico City, London, Tokyo and Sydney.)The responsibility of companies, particularly advertisers, to advocate on social issues and to provide a moral compass in a fraught political environment came up repeatedly during the week.While appearing on a panel of chief executives discussing diversity and inclusion, J. Clifford Hudson, the chief executive of Sonic Drive-In, which franchises its restaurants and is based in Oklahoma City, said he has been stymied on how public to be about efforts made within his company after a report last year showed that more Sonic customers associated with President Trump than any other presidential candidate. That was \u201cto my surprise,\u201d he said, \u201cwith believe me, no effort on our part whatsoever.\u201dMr. Hudson said he was proud that most of his senior team is made up of either women or ethnic minorities but he has wondered, \u201cDo I do that quietly or do I become more public about it?\u201d He added, \u201cThe for-profit private sector is going to be playing a stronger role in the next number of years at trying to reset the bar, for fear that the bar shifts in such a way that it\u2019s not healthy for society.\u201dA separate panel focused on the representation of women in commercials and highlighted recent research from the advertising company J. Walter Thompson New York and the Geena Davis Institute that showed men get far more screen time in ads compared with women, who are less likely to be depicted as funny or even employed.\u201cPeople don\u2019t trust government and big authorities, they\u2019re looking for companies to take courageous stands and really do more good in the world,\u201d said Debra Bass, president of global marketing services at Johnson & Johnson Consumer. \u201cWe know advertising creates stereotypes which shape culture and it\u2019s our responsibility to change culture so more women will have education and economic empowerment and less abuse.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in an environment where, wherever you stand on the political spectrum, I think it\u2019s clear to all of us right now that we\u2019re looking to actors outside of our government to help drive the social justice agenda,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. \u201cTo be part of an organization like ours and in this partnership with the N.F.L. is allowing us to start to do that.\u201dBoth companies have been smarting lately. Major brands like AT&T and Coca-Cola pulled ads from YouTube earlier this year after they were discovered on videos promoting offensive content like hate speech. More recently, Facebook disclosed that Russians had used fake accounts and online ads to fan divisive issues during the presidential campaign. The social network has also had to respond to the revelation that advertisers were able to target users who used terms like \u201cJew hater\u201d to describe themselves.Still, video is too enticing for issues like those to scare advertisers away.\u201cYou just have what I would actually liken to a gold rush in the content space,\u201d Rob Master, vice president of global media, categories and partnerships at Unilever, which owns brands like Dove soap and Lipton tea, said during a presentation. \u201cThe amount of money pouring into producing and developing content is unbelievable,\u201d he said, naming Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Fox and Hulu.Marketers are watching that, as well as how younger generations are using their smartphones, and figuring out where they might fit in, he said.\u201cWhat is the commercial model for a video on a phone or on the web across these different platforms?\u201d Mr. Master said. \u201cToday, some platforms call video what I would call a digital moving billboard. So how do we think about that in terms of media \u2014 how do you plan or buy for that?\u201dThere were also, of course, discussions that did not touch on seismic industry or societal shifts.During a panel on Instagram, the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, who sells goods under a namesake label, described how she decides to make work-related posts to her highly-followed account.\u201cI feel sort of honor-bound to the people who follow me to not exploit the relationship, not to trade on the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel better talking about the business on our business pages frankly.\u201d But when it does happen, she said, \u201cI try to be very thoughtful and plot out those occasions where I invade the personal with business.\u201dImran Khan, Snap\u2019s chief strategy officer, said that Snapchat users were creating more than three billion pictures and videos a day.\u201cThe problem with text is that text never captured your true voice \u2014 text might grab your attention but it never captured your imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, the way we communicate is changing, it\u2019s becoming visual. With texting, I always had to translate my feelings over text. Now with camera, I can do that instantly.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the announcement of a settlement between the California attorney general\u2019s office and Gatorade. The announcement was in September, not October.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kitchen of the Future: Smart and Fast but Not Much Fun", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conference, now in its third year, brings together people on the front lines of kitchen technology to try to figure out how to move the digital revolution deeper into the kitchen. The kitchen is where Americans spend 60 percent of their time at home when they are not sleeping, said Yoon Lee, a senior vice president at Samsung. That\u2019s why so many tech companies are focused on it.Almost everyone here this week at Benaroya Hall, the home of the Seattle Symphony \u2014 whether an executive from a major appliance manufacturer, a Google engineer or a hopeful young entrepreneur with a popular Kickstarter concept \u2014 agreed that it was only a matter of five to 10 years before artificial intelligence had a permanent seat at the dinner table.The coming kitchen technology, they said, will go well beyond a screen on the refrigerator door that allows you to check the weather while you search recipes and update the family calendar.Your power blender may be able to link to a device on your wrist that\u2019s been tracking your diet, then check in with your freezer and your kitchen scale. It could set up the right smoothie recipe based on what\u2019s on hand, how much weight you\u2019ve gained and which fruit you prefer.Your oven will be able to decide how and when to start roasting the salmon, then text the family when dinner\u2019s ready. Your refrigerator may be able to place a grocery store order, based on a careful study of how much you like to pay for certain items, whether you want them organic and whether peaches are in season.Artificial intelligence will eventually understand your cooking needs so well that you need only tell a device that you\u2019d like to make your grandmother\u2019s chicken and noodles on Thursday, and all the ingredients will be ordered, paid for and delivered in time to cook. And when you start to cook, a virtual sous-chef will help with technique; a smart pan will suggest you turn down the heat before you scorch the onions.The smart kitchen might even track how much of the dish you end up throwing away, and let you know who took the last beer in the refrigerator. (Don\u2019t worry! It ordered more.)\u201cWe are talking to them and they are talking back to us,\u201d she said in a speech to the conference, which she urged to think first about what cooks might need in the kitchen and then design the technology to help them.But based on the buzz here, many people see a future in which no one will need to know how to cook at all.\u201cYou\u2019ll get appliances and hardware that lets you perform at a higher level of proficiency than what you can train for,\u201d said Nikhil Bhogal, a founder and the chief technical officer of June, which makes a WiFi-enabled countertop oven by the same name that recognizes the food you put into it and tells you how to cook it precisely.Much of this is still just a glint in an engineer\u2019s eye. To truly connect everything in the kitchen, technology and recipes will have to be standardized in such a way that food can be tracked from the farm to the plate.The dreamers here talked of inventing a single database, like iTunes, for recipes, or even doing away with recipes altogether.Some of the hits and misses from the Smart Kitchen Summit held this week in Seattle.Innit is still in development, but it appears to be software based on online recipes that have been broken down into preparations for various starches, produce and proteins. It will eventually learn, through the miracle of artificial intelligence, what sauce you like on your chicken and whether you have chicken in refrigerator, and then give you a recipe for it.Cooks at the conference were skeptical. It was hard to find anyone who wanted to discuss the joy that comes from cooking, or the escape from a hectic, technical life that softly scrambling an egg in the morning can bring.None of technical solutions seemed to account for how a cook might consider the ripeness of a pear, or thrill from creating a new recipe out of a pile of fresh chanterelles. The sense of satisfaction in learning a new dish or getting better at something didn\u2019t seem to be part of the kitchen of the future.\u201cThe assumption is that we\u2019re all very busy, but want to cook like a chef at home so we don\u2019t waste time making a meal that doesn\u2019t look or taste good,\u201d said Amanda Gold, a former food journalist who now consults with chefs and food companies.Although she embraces technology that brings people back to the kitchen, Ms. Gold says cooking is both creative and emotional.\u201cIf cooking becomes such a guided process that you don\u2019t have any emotion around it, you\u2019re going to take the heart out of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mogadishu Truck Bombings Are Deadliest Attack in Decades", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOGADISHU, Somalia \u2014 When a double truck bombing shattered the night in Mogadishu on Saturday, rescue workers began the grim search for survivors that has become all too common as Somalia battles an Islamist insurgency. They picked through burned-out cars and hunted as best they could in a collapsed hotel.\u201cThis is the deadliest incident I ever remember\u201d since the 1990s, when the government collapsed, a shaken Senator Abshir Ahmed said in a Facebook posting.The attack came as the United States under President Trump has made a renewed push to defeat the Shabab, Somali-based militants who have terrorized the country and East Africa for years, killing civilians across borders, worsening famine and destabilizing a broad stretch of the region. While no one had yet claimed responsibility for the bombings, suspicion immediately fell on the group, which frequently targets the capital, Mogadishu.The Shabab \u2014 which once controlled most of the city \u2014 have lost much of their territory in recent years, the result of attacks by African Union forces, a fitfully strengthening Somali Army and increasing American air power. But the group remains a potent killing force, despite years of American counterterrorism operations.Some of the militants have proclaimed allegiance to Al Qaeda, while others support the Islamic State.As the death toll grew Sunday, the Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, declared three days of national mourning. He donated blood for the victims and asked his fellow citizens to do the same.On Sunday, fires were still burning at the scene of the bombings. Senator Ahmed, deputy speaker of the upper house of Parliament, wrote on his Facebook page that the director of one hospital had told him at least 130 bodies there were burned beyond recognition.Witnesses said the attack was made even worse by the number of cars stuck on the road where one of the bombs exploded.\u201cThere was a traffic jam, and the road was packed with bystanders and cars,\u201d a waiter at a nearby restaurant said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster.\u201dDoctors at hospitals in Mogadishu struggled to save the wounded on Sunday. The Associated Press quoted one nurse as saying staff members had seen \u201cunspeakable horrors\u201d in a hospital where the smell of blood was strong. The news agency reported that exhausted doctors fought to keep their eyes open even as the screams of victims echoed through the halls.Hopes for Somalia tend to ebb and flow after more than 25 years of chaos since its central government collapsed. In recent years, there has been a bit more optimism with a new government in power. Still, in the fragile world of Somali politics, the threat of the Shabab never went away. Hundreds of people have been killed or wounded in attacks on the capital this year alone.Counterterrorism specialists said the size of the bombings Saturday, which were well beyond what the Shabab have conducted before, suggested that the group might have received help from operatives with the Qaeda arm in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is renowned for its prowess with explosives.Africa specialists said the attack could backfire on the Shabab \u2014 and that may be one reason the group has not claimed responsibility, at least so far.\u201cWhen the group feels under pressure, it lashes out with more significant attacks,\u201d said Tricia Bacon, a Somali specialist at American University in Washington and a former State Department counterterrorism analyst. She called the attack \u201ca bad miscalculation\u201d by the Shabab that will likely shore up public resolve for the government\u2019s commitment to fighting the militants.Some analysts also suggest that the Shabab may have been trying to take advantage of Somalia\u2019s most recent political instability; the federal and regional governments have disagreed over which side to support in a political standoff between Qatar and a group of countries led by Saudi Arabia. One of those countries, the United Arab Emirates, supplied weapons to some of the regional governments in 2015.Previous attacks on the capital this year have killed or wounded at least 771 people, according to data compiled by the Long War Journal. The operations included remotely detonated vehicles, suicide car bombings and suicide assaults. At least 11 of these attacks have been assassination attempts against Somali military, intelligence, and government personnel, as well as Somali journalists.The blast occurred two days after the head of the United States Africa Command was in Mogadishu to meet with Somalia\u2019s president, and after the country\u2019s defense minister and army chief resigned for undisclosed reasons.About 200 to 300 members of American Special Operations forces work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes.Hussein Mohamed reported from Mogadishu, Somalia, Eric Schmitt from Washington, and Mohamed Ibrahim from Helsinki, Finland.Advertisement"}

Yes, there were marshmallows, polyester and nudity.Hello, muddah. Hello, faddah. Here I am at Camp John Waters.The kids are nice. Actually, they\u2019re grown-ups, among them a vaudeville troupe from Montreal; a pair of bartenders from Key West, Fla.; burlesque dancers; nudists; and at least one pornographer. There are plastic pink flamingos outside the cabins, and the activities, alongside tennis and kayaking, include Scotch & Cigars and a campfire screening of \u201cFemale Trouble.\u201dBefore the bus comes to take us home, here\u2019s a recap:\u201cThe Pope of Trash.\u201d \u201cThe People\u2019s Pervert.\u201d To his fans, Mr. Waters is a countercultural demigod, a dirty class clown at 71. His gleefully transgressive films, including \u201cPink Flamingos\u201d and \u201cSerial Mom,\u201d created a topsy-turvy world in which gross is glamorous, housewives are homicidal, and the noblest title one can achieve is Filthiest Person Alive.The campers, who paid up to $599, were a self-selecting group of exhibitionists and oddballs for whom Mr. Waters\u2019s movies were a beacon of belonging. \u201cWe\u2019re here to meet a bunch of filthy freaks, and maybe make some new friends,\u201d said Jennifer Sisley, one of the Key West bartenders. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got a common interest.\u201dAlastair McQueen, a 28-year-old filmmaker, grew up in North Carolina and saw \u201cPink Flamingos\u201d when he was 12. \u201cMy whole life was different after that,\u201d he said, sneaking a cigarette behind the buffet tent. \u201cThat\u2019s when I understood there were other weirdos like me.\u201dHe was wearing cutoff jeans, a leopard-print V-neck and an eye patch (\u201cI have pinkeye\u201d), and had big plans for the Saturday meet-and-greet with Mr. Waters. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint a picture of him with my penis,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to have him sign my penis.\u201dMr. Waters, as it turned out, had been a camper himself. From ages 8 to 13, he attended Happy Hollow, in his hometown, Baltimore, then went to a boating camp as a teenager. \u201cI learned so much as a young man from summer camp,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI learned to smoke unfiltered cigarettes.\u201d Then he mentioned other, less PG-rated activities.He had a crush on one of his counselors, but the other campers didn\u2019t beat him up for being gay, \u201cbecause all the brutes thought I was crazy,\u201d he said in an interview the next day. \u201cI wanted to be a bad teenager. I remember listening to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll secretly and smoking. Anything that was juvenile delinquent, that\u2019s what I wanted to be.\u201dSaturday morning began with a 9:30 flag ceremony, where beer was served and an oversize bra was hoisted up the flagpole. From the lawn you could see the shimmering waterfront, framed by pine trees, log cabins and Adirondack chairs. \u201cWhat\u2019s the nudity policy?\u201d someone asked over breakfast.After a drag lunch, some campers gathered on the lawn for color war, while others joined the Baltimore Bar Hike, turning the archery range into a makeshift pub. At the arts and crafts table, projects included enemy bracelets and satanic Christmas ornaments.Outside her tent, Dominique Maciejka, who owns a vintage-clothing store on Long Island, had set up a pop-up shop for those who forgot to pack their polyester onesies. \u201cWe have lace masks, rainbow suspenders, bow ties, sunglasses,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have kaleidoscope crystal glasses, which are fun because they make you feel like you\u2019re on drugs, even if you\u2019re not.\u201dAt 5 p.m., Mr. Waters held court at the central lodge for a three-hour meet-and-greet. Stationed at a table below crisscrossed canoe paddles, he signed everything from books to plastic dog feces.As the sun set over the lake, the campers gathered at the boathouse for a costume contest, judged by Mr. Waters.There were multiple Tracy Turnblads (the zaftig heroine of \u201cHairspray\u201d), in headbands and roach-print dresses. A few people came as Johnny Depp from \u201cCry-Baby,\u201d with gelled hair and biker jackets. (It\u2019s the easiest thing for lesbians to pull off, one woman said.) One guy was dressed as an Odorama scratch-and-sniff card from \u201cPolyester.\u201dThe boathouse had been decorated as the 1960s dance-off show from \u201cHairspray.\u201d As Mr. Waters looked on, contestants walked the stage and introduced themselves. (\u201cHi, I\u2019m Jerry, and I\u2019m the pervert from \u2018Desperate Living.\u2019\u201d)Some campers stayed to dance, while others went out to the fire pit to toast marshmallows under the stars. Mr. Waters slipped out the back door and stood beneath the pines, elated. \u201cIt\u2019s like Jonestown, but with a happy ending,\u201d he said.Sunday was quiet, even wistful. Ms. McCarthy, still reveling in her second-place finish, taught an impromptu burlesque class on the basketball court. \u201cLove your skin!\u201d she instructed the students, having stripped down to panties and pasties and smeared herself with peanut butter.A fellow camper approached her and said, \u201cYou are the filthiest person here.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d she said, beaming.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the person showing off a John Waters tattoo. He is Casey Stines, not Scooter LaForge.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of a drag queen. She is Pissi Miles, not Pissy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Times Issues Social Media Guidelines for the Newsroom", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York Times announced on Friday an updated and expanded set of guidelines for our journalists\u2019 use of social media.The new guidelines underscore our newsroom\u2019s appreciation for the important role social media now plays in our journalism, but also call for our journalists to take extra care to avoid expressing partisan opinions or editorializing on issues that The Times is covering.In the interest of transparency, we\u2019ve included the complete guidelines below, along with an introductory memo sent to the newsroom by Dean Baquet, our executive editor.We\u2019re always interested in hearing from our readers. Do the new guidelines raise any questions for you? If so, please share your thoughts in the comments section._____To the newsroom:The New York Times has been a dominant force on social media for years. Our newsroom accounts have tens of millions of followers. Many of our journalists are influential voices on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other platforms. The voices of our readers, listeners and viewers inform and improve our reporting. We believe that to remain the world\u2019s best news organization, we have to maintain a vibrant presence on social media.But we also need to make sure that we are engaging responsibly on social media, in line with the values of our newsroom.That\u2019s why we\u2019re issuing updated and expanded social media guidelines.The guidelines were developed in a collaborative way by Cliff Levy, Phil Corbett and Cynthia Collins, and are rooted in the very experiences of our journalists. Please read them closely, and take them to heart.\u2014 Dean Baquet, Executive Editor_____Social media plays a vital role in our journalism. On social platforms, our reporters and editors can promote their work, provide real-time updates, harvest and curate information, cultivate sources, engage with readers and experiment with new forms of storytelling and voice.We can effectively pull back the curtain and invite readers to witness, and potentially contribute to, our reporting. We can also reach new audiences.But social media presents potential risks for The Times. If our journalists are perceived as biased or if they engage in editorializing on social media, that can undercut the credibility of the entire newsroom.We\u2019ve always made clear that newsroom employees should avoid posting anything on social media that damages our reputation for neutrality and fairness. This memo offers more detailed guidelines.Department heads will be responsible for ensuring that these guidelines are followed by all staff members in their departments. Violations will be noted on performance reviews.We sought extensive feedback across the newsroom in order to ensure that this was a collaborative process rooted in our journalists\u2019 experiences. Several Times reporters who are prominent on social media reviewed the guidelines, offering very helpful input, and endorsed them.Those reporters include: Yamiche Alcindor, Peter Baker, Rukmini Callimachi, Nick Confessore, Max Fisher, Maggie Haberman, Katie Rogers and Margot Sanger-Katz.\u2022 In social media posts, our journalists must not express partisan opinions, promote political views, endorse candidates, make offensive comments or do anything else that undercuts The Times\u2019s journalistic reputation.\u2022 Our journalists should be especially mindful of appearing to take sides on issues that The Times is seeking to cover objectively.\u2022 These guidelines apply to everyone in every department of the newsroom, including those not involved in coverage of government and politics.\u2022 We consider all social media activity by our journalists to come under this policy. While you may think that your Facebook page, Twitter feed, Instagram, Snapchat or other social media accounts are private zones, separate from your role at The Times, in fact everything we post or \u201clike\u201d online is to some degree public. And everything we do in public is likely to be associated with The Times.\u2022 On that same note, we strongly discourage our journalists from making customer service complaints on social media. While you may believe that you have a legitimate gripe, you\u2019ll most likely be given special consideration because of your status as a Times reporter or editor.\u2022 Avoid joining private and \u201csecret\u201d groups on Facebook and other platforms that may have a partisan orientation. You should also refrain from registering for partisan events on social media. If you are joining these groups for reporting purposes, please take care in what you post.\u2022 Always treat others with respect on social media. If a reader questions or criticizes your work or social media post, and you would like to respond, be thoughtful. Do not imply that the person hasn\u2019t carefully read your work.\u2022 If the criticism is especially aggressive or inconsiderate, it\u2019s probably best to refrain from responding. We also support the right of our journalists to mute or block people on social media who are threatening or abusive. (But please avoid muting or blocking people for mere criticism of you or your reporting.)\u2022 If you feel threatened by someone on social media, please inform your supervisors immediately. The Times has policies in place to protect the safety of our journalists.\u2022 We believe in the value of using social media to provide live coverage and to offer live updates. But there may be times when we prefer that our journalists focus their first efforts on our own digital platforms.\u2022 We generally want to publish exclusives on our own platforms first, not on social media, but there may be instances when it makes sense to post first on social media. Consult your supervisors for guidance.\u2022 Be transparent. If you tweeted an error or something inappropriate and wish to delete the tweet, be sure to quickly acknowledge the deletion in a subsequent tweet. Please consult our social media corrections policy for guidance.\u2022 If you are linking to other sources, aim to reflect a diverse collection of viewpoints. Sharing a range of news, opinions or satire from others is usually appropriate. But consistently linking to only one side of a debate can leave the impression that you, too, are taking sides.\u2022 Exercise caution when sharing scoops or provocative stories from other organizations that The Times has not yet confirmed. In some cases, a tweet of another outlet\u2019s story by a Times reporter has been interpreted as The Times confirming the story, when it in fact has not.\u2022 We want our journalists to feel that they can use social media to experiment with voice, framing and reporting styles \u2014 particularly when such experiments lead to new types of storytelling on The Times\u2019s platforms.\u2022 Of course, it\u2019s worth emphasizing again that just because our journalists can try new things on social media, that does not mean they have a license to veer into editorializing or opinion.\u2022 If you don\u2019t know whether a social media post conforms to Times standards, ask yourself these questions:1. Would you express similar views in an article on The Times\u2019s platforms? 2. Would someone who reads your post have grounds for believing that you are biased on a particular issue?3. If readers see your post and notice that you\u2019re a Times journalist, would that affect their view of The Times\u2019s news coverage as fair and impartial? 4. Could your post hamper your colleagues\u2019 ability to effectively do their jobs?5. If someone were to look at your entire social media feed, including links and retweets, would they have doubts about your ability to cover news events in a fair and impartial way?As always, if you are unsure, please consult with your supervisor or other newsroom leaders about your social media practices.As you can see, we have tried to strike a balance. We want our newsroom to embrace social media, which offers us so many opportunities to connect with readers, listeners and viewers (not to mention sources), extending the reach of The Times. But we also hope that our journalists will take to heart these social media guidelines \u2014 and especially the insights that we have collected from our colleagues about how to engage on these platforms.We warmly welcome your feedback. Please contact Cliff Levy, Phil Corbett or Cynthia Collins with questions about these guidelines. Given the dynamic nature of social media, we are sure that the guidelines will continue to evolve.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the Mainland, a Duty to Help Puerto Rico", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySide StreetAfter a month of silence since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Edwin Aponte finally made contact last week with the world beyond his town of Coamo. It came via a Facebook post, a simple check-in from afar that his friends celebrated as if it brought news that they had hit the lottery. Sure, he had no water, power and little food. Nor did he have his apartment, which was flooded.But he had hope.\u201cCoamo was hit hard,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut we will be reborn stronger than ever.\u201dThe devastation is widespread and heartbreaking, he said a few days later by phone. The first glimpse he got of federal emergency workers, he said, was 12 days after the hurricane. Some military rations and a case of water were dropped off at his childhood home on day 33. By then, people were getting desperate, he said, with some resorting to theft while tempers flared over minor dust-ups. Like thousands of other Puerto Ricans, he is leaving for Florida, at least until water and power are restored.\u201cWe are talking so much time and money to do the proper thing,\u201d Mr. Aponte said. \u201cThe Trump administration wants to turn around and put a Band-Aid on this. We need the diaspora to pressure Congress and make sure they step up. Nothing the diaspora does alone can finance what is needed. People have to call their representatives and tell them to vote yes on any bills for Puerto Rico assistance.\u201dMr. Aponte knows about large-scale reconstruction. Before returning to Puerto Rico to help a relative manage several properties, he had spent 25 years on the mainland doing quality control work on major projects like highways, airports and subways. Before that, he had been in the Air Force and, before that, at Yale (where we met in the late 1970s).He is both alarmed at what has happened, and not. The island had already been reeling from a brain drain as a result of an economic crisis triggered by the island\u2019s crippling $73 billion debt. He likened that burden to the economic millstone the French left on their once-enslaved colonial subjects in Haiti after the 1804 independence rebellion. The French demanded 150 million French francs \u2013 later reduced to 90 million francs, or about $40 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2013 in compensation for lost property.\u201cHaiti could never rise above that,\u201d Mr. Aponte, 58, said. \u201cThis is what is happening to Puerto Rico. We have an unpayable debt. I have been saying this for a while, but this is like a third world country.\u201dThis is where the diaspora can help. While the island has a nonvoting member of Congress, stateside Puerto Ricans have voting representatives who can advocate for their concerns, including debt relief, financial aid and the lifting of maritime laws that make imported everyday items more expensive. They can also put pressure on lawmakers to ensure that the rebuilding process is transparent and not a victim of the island\u2019s culture of patronage and back-scratching.The relationship between the two communities has never been a full partnership, said Hector Cordero-Guzm\u00e1n, a professor of public and international policy at Baruch College. \u201cThe island\u2019s political and economic elites have seen the diaspora as a convenient lobbying entity to be activated on behalf of the homeland when the homeland feels it needs them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been a transactional relationship and, at times, paternalistic.\u201dYet, as he and others point out, the diaspora is already helping, not just with rallies, protests and fund-raising events, but by providing direct aid to friends and family on the island \u2014 even taking them in and resettling them in places like Orlando, Fla., or New York City.As he prepared to leave, Mr. Aponte, like many others, wondered if the sluggish and inadequate emergency response was not by design. Land, he said, was now less expensive, and outside investors had been circling even before the hurricane.\u201cFor me, Mother Nature just helped the gringos move forward to where we will be a minority in our own land,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will become Hawaii, an overpriced place controlled by white people while bomba dancers do demonstrations for tourists.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sex, Sanctimony and Congress", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur topic for today is hypocrisy. The scene is \u2014 where else? \u2014 Congress.This week the House of Representatives voted 237 to 189 to make it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion on a woman who has been pregnant more than 20 weeks. Victory for the anti-choice forces. One of whom was apparently very interested in maintaining all options when he thought his own girlfriend was expecting.Meet Tim Murphy, a Republican congressman from the Pittsburgh suburbs who has a doctorate in psychology, and is the co-author of a couple of books with titles like \u201cOvercoming Passive-Aggression.\u201d He\u2019s married but \u2014 prodded by information revealed at his lover\u2019s divorce trial \u2014 he admits having strayed with another psychologist.Whoops. This is not actually a unique story. There\u2019s a history of lawmakers who are eager to restrict abortions in every case not involving their own personal sex life.Back in the \u201990s Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican, was targeted by his ex-wife, who claimed he had helped her get an abortion while they were married. It was a particularly embarrassing episode since Barr was so dedicated to the anti-choice movement he once said he\u2019d stop his wife from having an abortion even if she had gotten pregnant via a rape. (This was a different ex-wife from the one who announced Barr had taken her to the abortionist. One of the things the various stars of this story have in common is a certain friskiness.)More recently, Representative Scott DesJarlais, a Tennessee Republican who bragged about his \u201c100 percent pro-life voting record,\u201d was confronted with pesky divorce records that showed he\u2019d encouraged women to have abortions, including his ex-wife and a patient with whom he was having an affair. DesJarlais, a physician, is still in Congress and this week he was right there voting again against other people\u2019s abortion rights.In the case of Tim Murphy, the girlfriend\u2019s pregnancy was a false alarm. But The Post-Gazette texts showed him apologizing to her about the anti-abortion Facebook posts. He then denied having written them and blamed everything on \u201cstaff.\u201dMurphy is not one of those genial lawmakers whose affable demeanor makes him popular with his peers. Or even with his own office. The Post-Gazette also came up with a memo, apparently written by his chief of staff, complaining about constant turnover due to his \u201chostile, erratic, unstable, angry, aggressive and abusive behavior.\u201dThere was also a reference to an evening in which Murphy drove some of his staff members to an event in the pouring rain. His \u201cdangerous and erratic\u201d performance behind the wheel was possibly due to the fact that, according to the memo, he was also reading his iPad, playing YouTube videos and texting.If so, the most effective way to fight against late-term abortions would obviously be programs like teen pregnancy prevention. And making it easy for low-income women to afford contraceptives. And providing easy access to clinics like Planned Parenthood that offer both health services and counseling on effective birth control.And the Republican majority seems keen on cutting back spending on health care for poor children.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything else to call that but pure hypocrisy: We love it until it is born, and then it is somebody else\u2019s problem,\u201d said Representative Louise Slaughter of New York, who was leading the Democratic opposition to the anti-abortion bill.So that\u2019s our story. The moral is to beware of aggrieved, texting girlfriends. And politicians who want to be called pro-life without having to pay for it.Advertisement"}
