{"Headline": "The Frightful Five Want to Rule Entertainment. They Are Hitting Limits.", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that\u2019s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline.Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing \u2014 in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches \u2014 are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit.This is the first of several columns in which I\u2019ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment \u2014 their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked.Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201dThe Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.There\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201dThis story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?It\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It\u2019s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Pixel 2 Smartphone Is a Powerful Extravagance", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last smartphone I reviewed was the original Apple iPhone, which ushered in the mobile revolution back in 2007. At the time, I didn\u2019t exactly give the device a rave. Two weeks after waiting in line for hours outside the San Francisco Apple Store and paying $540 for the iPhone, I even returned it and got my money back.It was obvious to me that the iPhone was a powerful thing and everyone \u2014 from Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, right down to the people I passed on the street \u2014 kept telling me how great it was. But it was also an extravagance. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t really justify its $500-plus cost for another year.Ten years on, I\u2019m now reviewing the Pixel 2, the new flagship phone from Google that goes on sale Thursday. And my take is pretty much the same: People who want the latest and greatest phones won\u2019t be disappointed by the Pixel. But for most of us, this device, with a starting price of $649, is an extravagance.Google has found tremendous success convincing the world that it should prefer smartphones that run Android, its mobile operating system, which dominates global market share over Apple. But Google has had much less success designing and selling its own phones.Now comes the Pixel 2. After testing the gadget for nearly a week, I found I prefer it to the iPhone \u2014 though this is mostly because I have always carried Android phones. Android is what I\u2019m used to, and all my digital data is stored with Google, even though my daughters think I\u2019m silly for not buying an iPhone.Compared with other Android devices, the Pixel 2 XL, the model I tested and the larger of the two versions of the device, was also a big improvement. I own a Samsung Galaxy S7, widely considered the best Android phone on the market a year ago when it went on sale.(Incidentally, she meant it was not just better than my Samsung but also better than her iPhone. And that is not sacrilege. The detail and the colors are far sharper, even to an untrained eye like mine.)The Pixel also charged quickly; a few minutes plugged into the wall gets you hours of battery life. Google said the device is water-resistant. And the screen, 6.2 inches along the diagonal, was enormous \u2014 though not so huge that I couldn\u2019t comfortably hold the phone in one hand. It was nice that, for those rare occasions when I watched extended YouTube videos, the image stretched to the edge of the phone.Yet is any of this all that different from other top-of-the-line phones? Not really. And Google knows this. Even the steep $849 pricing for the Pixel 2 XL was in line with rivals.\u201cIt sounds more normal,\u201d my 13-year-old said. Still, she added that the improvement was small.That sums up all these services. Many are technically impressive, and some are useful. But they took the Pixel only so far past the status quo.Google Lens gave my 9-year-old several minutes of fun over the weekend. But it\u2019s not something she \u2014 or I \u2014 would use on a regular basis. (And it mistook a picture in my bedroom of New York\u2019s Flatiron Building for the Empire State Building.)The Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. My younger daughter loved it. (At one point, she said it was more fun than me.)But like those other assistants, it could not deal with more than just a handful of simple tasks, typically delivering web pages or preset answers in response to questions. When I asked the Assistant whether $824 was expensive for a smartphone, it gave me a YouTube video of a guy unboxing some sort of $20,000 monstrosity.Google boasts that you can instantly switch the Assistant into a mode that lets you type questions rather than ask them orally. But as my wife said, these assistants are useful only because they let you handle basic tasks \u2014 like sending a text or setting an alarm \u2014 without typing. If I wanted to type, I would just visit google.com.Still, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL. On the way to dinner on Saturday night, it correctly identified every song that played on the local 1980s station, from \u201cThe Warrior\u201d to \u201cDer Kommissar.\u201dEven so, I plan to keep the $849 for now. The smaller version of the new Pixel goes for $649, and I might go for that, when I finally need a new phone.Advertisement"}

Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \u201ccognitive diversity\u201d is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of \u2014 individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won\u2019t do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies. Whether companies do it intentionally or not, I worry that they will adjust the definition of diversity so that, conveniently, it\u2019s already achieved.Ms. Smith said in the email clarifying her remarks, \u201cOur commitment at Apple to increasing racial and gender diversity is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d That kind of diversity \u2014 the old-fashioned kind, that still remains elusive \u2014 is what I hope my industry won\u2019t abandon.B\u00e4r\u00ed A.

A \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d-style sled. A black mountain climber. A genderless person, available in a range of races and ages.Apple\u2019s new emojis are here.Emojis, colorful and playful pictograms that are available on a range of devices, have altered the way humans communicate with one other and have become a powerful force in pop culture, both online and off.Nevertheless, emojis have provided a cheeky visual shorthand for such common experiences as laughing, vomiting and, with the latest update, the desire to reference a hedgehog in everyday conversation.The latest update appears to continue a yearslong trend toward greater diversity among emojis, which began in earnest in 2015, when Apple allowed users to select the skin tone of most of the human pictograms.Among the options announced on Friday were a woman in a head scarf, a woman breast-feeding, and what the company called the love-you gesture, which it said was designed after the sign for \u201cI love you\u201d in American Sign Language, which combines the signs for the letters I, L and Y.So, how does a new emoji find its way to your screen? The process is complicated enough that it might make you feel like a smiley face with a nuclear mushroom cloud erupting from your head. (Yes, that is one of the new ones.)The process is shepherded by the Unicode Consortium, a little-known group that meets quarterly and includes executives from several large technology companies, including Apple and Google.The consortium was founded in the 1980s to develop a standardized code for text characters \u2014 including letters, numerals and, in the present day, emojis \u2014 that enables different computers easily to communicate with one other.Among the factors he cited for inclusion were whether the symbol had been translated into Unicode, and how likely it was to be popular or useful.\u201cCompleteness\u201d was also an influential factor, he said, citing the addition of a mosque and a synagogue to the emoji lexicon that had already included an image of a church.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Would That Couch Look at Home? Check Your Phone", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is not unusual to order a piece of furniture and realize, once it arrives, that it is completely wrong for your room. A red couch that looked amazing in the showroom may turn out to overwhelm your small space. And the last thing you want to do is invest in a heavy piece of furniture you have to pay to return.To help visualize that couch in your living room, furniture sellers and interior design firms have been rolling out new apps and online programs that allow you to try furniture at home using virtual and augmented reality.The new tools generally come in three flavors: 3-D features that enable you to virtually place furnishings in your room using the camera on your cellphone; styling apps that let you snap a picture of your space, clear it of all furniture and drop in new options as you shop online; and interior decorating services that do it all for you, selecting furnishings on your behalf and creating 3-D renderings of your room from photos you provide.To see how well they really work, I tried out a few from the comfort of my bedroom and living room \u2014 both of which need a refresh, if not an entirely new look. Some were trickier to use than others, but each one offers a glimpse at the future of online furniture shopping and interior design.For $69 per room, this online interior design service offers two surprisingly lifelike 3-D renderings of your space. The process is easy. You provide feedback on the room you want to design, including a rough budget, and take a quiz to help determine your style, selecting photos of rooms you are drawn to. (Because Modsy is an online software program, you can use your cellphone or computer.)Then, you snap eight photos of your room (one from each corner, and one from each wall) and upload to Modsy. In 10 days or less, you receive an email indicating your renderings are waiting for you in your Modsy account. If you like an item in your room, you can add it to a shopping cart. A personal shopping service coordinates shipping and delivery, ensuring that you have to enter your address and credit card only once.The style quiz, which determined I was a \u201cmod enthusiast,\u201d was fairly spot on: \u201cYou go for Danish Modern design and streamlined furniture, but incorporating some traditional pieces for comfort strikes the perfect balance.\u201dThe 3-D renderings I received were not only surprisingly realistic, but also fun to explore, showing each room outfitted with two sets of new furniture to scale and presented at various angles, including top-down and 360 views. And while a few pieces of furniture were not my first choice, most of it appealed to me.The first bedroom design had a similar layout to my current setup, replacing my simple teak bedroom set with a Tate upholstered bed (from Crate & Barrel) and Culla night stands (from Article) for a \u201csoft midcentury look,\u201d according to Modsy\u2019s design description, which was emailed to me when the renderings were finished. A Marbled wool rug (from West Elm) anchored the space while an Aspect walnut desk (from Crate & Barrel) was paired with a deep blue Helvetica chair (from West Elm).The second design, which was bolder with richer blue and white tones, flipped the bed to the other side of the room \u2014 a layout I had never considered but now would consider trying \u2014 replaced the desk with a dresser, reading nook and added a Dowel mirror (from West Elm).The few hiccups I encountered were easily resolved by tapping on a service bell icon for help with my design and dashing off a note about my issues: a couple of items, including a table lamp I was interested in, were not itemized in my list of products to buy; and I was not in love with the sectional that Modsy suggested for my living room or the art on the wall.For $199, you can get unlimited revisions and access to a Modsy designer via phone, chat or video. I opted for the cheaper version, which allows for one revised design per room and unlimited use of the \u201cstyle editor,\u201d which allows you to swap products and adjust layouts yourself.While using the bell service was a breeze, I found the \u201cstyle editor\u201d a bit clunky. It was not available on my phone. And when I tried to swap out a piece of art in my living room design using my laptop, I encountered a glitch that did not allow me to scroll down to see more options. As a result, I could access only a handful of alternative artworks, none of which appealed to me.Jacqui Wimberly, a Modsy publicist, pointed out that the style editor is an experiment. \u201cThere was such a high demand from customers to be able to make changes on their own that Modsy decided to release it in the beta state while they continue to work on a full-fledged editing feature,\u201d she said.In the end it didn\u2019t matter, as the Modsy designer I reached via the service bell icon was willing to swap it out for me.If you would rather create your own renderings for free, Hutch may be the app for you. Hutch, which debuted this year for iPhone and Android users, lets you be the designer by snapping a photo of your room and decorating in 2-D.Within an hour of submitting a photo of your room, Hutch virtually clears out all furniture, children\u2019s toys and clutter so you can fill it with furniture sold via the app. You can create your own look by selecting from furniture and accessories sold by Hutch\u2019s partners or choose from a list of completed designs called \u201cfilters\u201d to superimpose a specific look onto your room, complete with a price list of the furniture used.Don\u2019t like the Deco Inlay nightstand (from Anthropologie) under the \u201cflea market finds\u201d filter? You can easily swap it out with a Marotta end table (from Wayfair). Tapping an item sends you to the seller\u2019s website to find dimensions or to buy.While the filters were easy and fun to play with, I was disappointed by the lack of options when trying to create my own look. Though I was designing a living room and bedroom, there were no options to customize other spaces like a dining area, children\u2019s bedroom or playroom. And while I wanted to put a TV console under the window in my living room, the only categories available were sofas, coffee tables, lamps, art, curtains and rods, bouquets, and side tables.A few of the categories, including side tables, table lamps and chairs, only offered one option: sold by Hutch, all of which were out of stock. And for nontraditional spaces, you may have to use your imagination or try a couple of different angles before you find a filter that fits your layout.Beatrice Fischel-Bock, Hutch\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, said more rooms are in the works and that she will have her team look into what must have been a glitch I experienced when personalizing my living room. \u201cWe have thousands of products in the system,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be seeing just one. There should be at least 10 backup options.\u201dBy November, Hutch plans to let you play with layouts to make it easier to design nontraditional spaces.Apple\u2019s latest operating system for iPhones and iPads rolled out on Sept. 19 along with a flurry of new apps that leverage Apple\u2019s new augmented reality development platform. Houzz, the home renovation and design site, was among them, with a new version of its 3-D shopping feature, \u201cView in My Room 3D,\u201d which lets you immediately place three-dimensional images of furniture, for free.Say you are shopping online for a floor lamp for your dining room. A tap of a button below the item lets you view the lamp in your room by accessing your phone\u2019s camera and superimposing a 3-D image of the lamp on the screen.(Ikea, Wayfair and others rolled out similar features in the App Store with Apple\u2019s latest operating system. Wayfair\u2019s version also works on devices supported by Tango, Google\u2019s augmented reality platform.)Houzz\u2019s new version comes with a catalog of 500,000 products in 3-D. It eliminates a quirk of the previous iteration, which required users to pinch and zoom furnishings into place \u2013 an arduous task in my experience, that resulted in inadvertently shrinking items down to the size of a pea whenever I tried to fit them to my space. Now the app eliminates that frustration by automatically sizing images to scale. A new version of \u201cView in My Room 3-D\u201d was released on Sept. 26 for Android users.Seeing the images at scale removes the guesswork involved in figuring out whether that coffee table will actually fit in your cramped living room. You can also now walk up to that coffee table to get a better sense of its texture. Multiple items can be viewed at once on the screen, with each automatically added to a shopping list so you don\u2019t have to leave the app to buy. Just don\u2019t try to virtually hang a ceiling lamp in your room. The app does not yet support ceiling lamps in 3-D.If all you want is to get an idea of how a specific piece of furniture will look in your room, Houzz is a good, fast option. For those who want to play around with different looks, Hutch will help you do that for free. For those of us who want more hand-holding while decorating a room, Modsy is a solid, low-cost alternative to seeing an interior designer in person.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Amazon, Diversity Concerns Flare Up After Harassment Accusations", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon on Friday tried to quell concerns among employees about sexual harassment accusations against an executive, sending an email to its staff saying the company would review its policies to ensure that \u201cthey are doing their job to provide a harassment-free workplace.\u201dThe email is the first broad internal communication by Amazon since Roy Price, who oversaw Amazon Studios, left the company this week after details of the accusations became public. A lawyer for the woman who has made the accusations said Amazon previously investigated and knew all the details about the episode, which happened in 2015.Amazon\u2019s handling of Mr. Price has set off confusion, debate and finger-pointing inside the company, according to two employees. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies, said numerous employees were heatedly discussing the timing of Mr. Price\u2019s departure.Some current and former employees are suggesting that the scarcity of women at the upper echelons of Amazon could have made the company more lenient toward Mr. Price until his actions became a public relations embarrassment.Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.The episode involving Mr. Price occurred in 2015 when he was in a car with Isa Dick Hackett, a Hollywood producer. She told investigators for Amazon shortly after the car ride that Mr. Price made unwanted sexual advances toward her.But there is confusion among some Amazon employees about why Mr. Price did not lose his job in 2015 after the company learned of Ms. Hackett\u2019s accusations. One consequence Mr. Price faced after the episode was being told to be careful how much alcohol he drank at work functions, according to a third employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies. The employee was briefed on the decision.Some of the frustration inside the company has been directed at Jeff Blackburn, the Amazon senior vice president who directly managed Mr. Price. Mr. Blackburn sent the email to Amazon\u2019s film and television employees on Friday, and it was more broadly distributed by other executives to their groups.In his email, Mr. Blackburn said Amazon was \u201ctaking this situation, and the general issue of sexual harassment, very seriously.\u201d He said it was not appropriate to share personnel details publicly, but said that Mr. Price\u2019s departure \u201cfollowed new information that surfaced last week, as well as other factors.\u201dCharles Harder, a lawyer for Mr. Price, did not respond to messages requesting comment.The pinnacle of Amazon is an elite group known as the S-team, roughly 16 senior executives, fewer than a dozen of whom report directly to Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive. Just one member of the S-team is a woman, Beth Galetti, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for human resources, according to two of the three employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In August, at a staff meeting for Amazon employees held at a basketball arena, Mr. Bezos was asked about the dearth of diversity \u2014 implying gender and race \u2014 on his senior leadership team. Amazon employees applauded loudly at the question.Mr. Bezos replied that diversity was important at Amazon, according to two of the employees who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. But Mr. Bezos said that adding more diversity to the leadership team would happen slowly because of low turnover in its ranks \u2014 an answer that left many employees disappointed.One of the Amazon employees, who recently looked at an organizational chart, said Amazon\u2019s S-team members and the people who report directly to them amount to roughly 90 people, about 75 of whom are men.Amazon has taken some steps in recent years to make working at the company more appealing to women. Two years ago, it instituted a more generous maternity leave policy, providing birth mothers with up to 20 weeks of paid leave.But the company\u2019s office culture still has a hard-charging reputation that could make it harder to recruit more women. Textio, a Seattle start-up that uses software to analyze language, has examined public job postings for all the major internet companies. The company found that the language in Amazon\u2019s skewed most sharply to the masculine end of the spectrum, with frequent use of words like \u201cwickedly,\u201d \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201cmaniacal.\u201dJodi Kantor contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

The company\u2019s goal, executives said, is to allow anyone with an internet connection to become proficient with technology and prepare for a job in areas like information technology support and app development.Google detailed its job training program as Silicon Valley faces increasing criticism over what some say is an unchecked influence over business and society. Google is also among a number of companies facing scrutiny over the role their internet services played in Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\u201cWe understand there\u2019s uncertainty and even concern about the pace of technological change, but we know that technology will be an engine of America\u2019s growth for years to come,\u201d Mr. Pichai said. \u201cThe nature of work is fundamentally changing, and that is shifting the link between education, training and opportunity.\u201dGoogle plans to donate $1 billion to nonprofits through its charitable arm, Google.org, with the aim of addressing the gap between the skills required by modern companies and the skills that are taught in schools. Google said it was donating $10 million to Goodwill Industries, for example, for digital job training programs. Company employees also will volunteer one million hours at those nonprofits.Google has long been a leader in research on artificial intelligence, and Mr. Pichai has made it the centerpiece of his company\u2019s plans. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are leaning on A.I. technology in all manner of products, from new smartphones to self-driving cars. But with that automation comes disruption and concern that breakthroughs may upend entire industries and eliminate millions of jobs, particularly in trucking and transportation.Google has been put under a harsh light over the last year, an unaccustomed spot for a company that has long been one of the tech industry\u2019s most admired outfits and is still considered one of the best places in the world to work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe May Collide on Taxing Apple and Amazon", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat rivalry has the potential to fuel tensions between the United States and its allies. Yet it could turn out that the European crackdown on American multinationals will ultimately help \u2014 rather than hobble \u2014 Washington\u2019s efforts to get them to pay up. The harder that other countries make it for American companies to take advantage of tax havens and sweetheart deals abroad, the weaker the incentives are for businesses to stash money out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\u201cIf we don\u2019t move to a more modern system, we may lose the ability to gain that revenue,\u201d Mr. Camp warned.\u201cThose are like dinosaurs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving towards extinction.\u201dSo far, the team of Trump administration officials and lawmakers who drew up the latest framework for rewriting the tax code has released mostly general principles.Now the I.R.S. taxes the worldwide profits of American corporations, but the tax kicks in only after that income is repatriated to the United States. As a result, American multinationals simply don\u2019t bring much of it home. Republicans have made clear they intend to switch to taxing only profits earned within the United States, what\u2019s known as a territorial system.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.The $2.6 trillion in foreign profits that corporations already parked overseas in order to escape paying the I.R.S. would be required to be repatriated \u2014 although taxed at a steep discount. And there are promises to prevent the tax base from shrinking, and discourage businesses from putting more operations and earnings overseas. At the same time, the official corporate rate would be slashed to 20 percent, from 35 percent, to make American companies more competitive with their foreign rivals.But this frame still lacks a picture, missing the details of how to accomplish those ambitious if sometimes conflicting goals.Without tough safeguards, for example, the shift away from a worldwide system could end up curbing rather than promoting investment at home as American companies move even more operations overseas to avoid paying any United States taxes.To some experts, like Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College, the only way to prevent American companies from exploiting loopholes in a new territorial regime is with a minimum tax. If a company\u2019s tax rate fell below the floor in, say, Bermuda, it would have to pay the difference to the I.R.S.Other experts, though, suggest borrowing another idea to broaden the tax base from foreign tax regulators \u2014 like more aggressive efforts to tax foreign multinationals.\u201cAll of these other countries are basically trying to beef up and protect their tax base by ensuring foreign multinationals pay tax on income earned in their country,\u201d he added, \u201cand not on income earned by their own domestic multinationals.\u201dThis is a different tack from the one taken in the United States, where tax dodges by homegrown billion-dollar corporations have been criticized for increasing the tax burden on companies that can\u2019t shield assets.The complaint that the American tax code favors foreign multinationals over domestic ones did, however, arouse interest last week at Senate hearings on a tax overhaul.The delay, he said, means that the United States is, in effect, paying \u201cforeign investors to take over our companies with our own tax dollars.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what you need to know about the premium iPhone.Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.There are various ways to pay that hefty price.The simplest route is to pay for the device outright. This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device \u2014 like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier \u2014 whenever you want.You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan. For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month. This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.There are various early upgrade plans on the market. With Apple\u2019s early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once you\u2019ve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate. (I\u2019m not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)So what\u2019s the difference? Mainly, the screen.\u25a0The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.\u25a0The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels \u2014 the border surrounding the display \u2014 whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ. The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner. The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person\u2019s head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner. The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.Face ID is brand new \u2014 there hasn\u2019t been anything like it on a smartphone before. It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Because the shape of a person\u2019s head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone else\u2019s face is one in a million, according to Apple.It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces. If you\u2019re skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boom in American Liquefied Natural Gas Is Shaking Up the Energy World", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil and MoneyHOUSTON \u2014 A shale gas drilling boom over the last decade has propelled the United States from energy importer to exporter, taking the country a giant leap toward the goal of energy independence declared by presidents for half a century.Now the upheaval of the domestic energy sector is going global. A swell of gas in liquefied form shipped from Texas and Louisiana is descending on global markets, producing a broader glut and lower energy prices.The United States was supposed to be a big L.N.G. importer, not a world class exporter. The frenzy of drilling in shale gas fields across the country changed that over the last decade, creating a glut far larger than domestic demand could possibly consume. Companies that spent billions of dollars to build import platforms suddenly had useless facilities until they spent billions more to convert them for export.The switch will remake the global gas market for decades to come. Energy experts are predicting that the transformation will weaken Russia\u2019s dominance over European power markets, help clean the air in cities across China and India by replacing the burning of coal and eventually provide cheaper and cleaner fuel to African villages.The full dimensions of the wave over the next four or five years, including its impact on the environment and climate change, are hard to predict, in part because they will depend on the policies adopted by many governments. But as several American multibillion-dollar export terminals come on line, few doubt that the influence of more gas, as the cleanest burning fossil fuel, will be consequential for powerful and poor countries alike.Experts point to Mexico as an example of how transformative gas can be in a matter of only a few years. As the American shale boom accelerated, producing more gas than its northern neighbor could consume, Mexico decided to import as much cheap gas as possible. Mexico replaced its dirtier burning coal and petroleum products, and now more than a quarter of the country\u2019s electricity is powered by American gas.Four additional cross-border pipelines are to be completed over the next two years, and many more are in the planning phase. The gas imports have improved air quality, helped Mexico reach goals to reduce its carbon footprint to meet Paris climate agreement targets and freed capital to invest in more exploration and production of oil, which is more valuable on world markets.Because Mexico has a border close to Texas oil and gas fields, pipelines have made the transformation relatively easy. Exporting and importing liquefied gas is more complicated. Gas is expensive to ship overseas because it must be cooled to minus 260 degrees, condensing it to what is called liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., to be shipped in giant tankers. The importing country then has to turn the liquid back into gas so it can be transported by pipelines. But even though liquefied gas is usually more expensive than piped gas or even coal, demand and supplies are growing fast.\u201cThis bulge of L.N.G. is going to completely upset the apple cart of world energy politics and the global competition of fuels that is still hard for people to comprehend,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cRussia will be the loser. We can already see their leverage on the gas market in Europe and the leverage they are trying to create over China dissipating.\u201dEnough L.N.G. export capacity is under construction to catapult it from 33 percent to nearly 40 percent of the total international gas trade by 2022, even while piped gas shipments are also growing globally.Roughly 60 percent of the new L.N.G. export capacity is being built in the United States, which only began exporting large supplies last year, giving Washington a new tool for its foreign policy toolbox and raising the country to the top tier of exporters, which includes Qatar, Australia and Russia.Lithuania became the first former Soviet republic to import a shipment of American natural gas in August, a symbolic move that came as Washington pledged to reduce the dependency of Europe on Russia, which has been known to use gas as a political weapon.The Lithuania shipment came only a month after Poland became the first Eastern European country to import American gas. Russia has already been forced to lower its gas prices to Europe in an attempt to diminish European thirst for American gas. That effort has cost Russian companies revenues and made expansion of L.N.G. facilities in the Arctic less economically feasible.Russia has gained European market share, in large part because North Sea and Dutch production are declining. But energy experts say that the United States will surely cut into Russian market share with its new L.N.G. exports because Europe is alarmed by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and interference in the elections of several Western democracies. There are few ways to punish Russia more than reducing its energy revenues, which account for nearly half of the Kremlin\u2019s budget and spreads political benefits to President Putin\u2019s powerful cronies.\u201cForcing Russia to compete in a more competitive gas market in Europe and giving European consumers alternative sources of supply significantly weakens Russia\u2019s geopolitical influence in Europe,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, who was a senior energy adviser to President Obama and is now director of Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy. \u201cThe transition of the U.S. to one of the world\u2019s largest gas exporters has very significant economic, environmental and geopolitical implications.\u201dEuropeans tend to be suspicious of hydrocarbons like gas, and especially the hydraulic fracturing methods that coax gas from hard shale rock, much preferring renewables. Many skeptics in Europe and the United States note that the production and transport of gas can leak methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, making it less reliable as an environmental solution.Natural gas consumption in Europe had been declining in recent years as the continent moved strongly to renewables and as some countries also burned more cheap coal to replace nuclear. But demand for gas rebounded in 2015 and 2016, principally at the expense of coal.The United Kingdom may be leading the way, with carbon pricing and other policies designed to phase out coal power by 2025, thus giving gas a big opening. For most of the other big economies, gas is a supplement, especially in France when its nuclear plant fleet needs repairs as it did in 2016. German gas-fired power plants that were dormant in 2015 have come back on.Oil company executives with a stake in natural gas say gas is a perfect complement to Europe\u2019s push for renewable energy, by maintaining power when the sun does not shine or the wind does not blow.\u201cIncreasingly, European countries are seeing that they do need gas-fired power generation to balance out renewables,\u201d said Tor Martin, senior vice president for marketing and supply at Statoil, the Norwegian oil and gas company that is also investing in offshore wind power.The biggest increase in demand for liquefied natural gas will come from China and India, as their growing middle classes demand more power and as their industries grow.The International Energy Agency estimates an annual growth rate of 8.7 percent in Chinese gas consumption through 2022.Gas is more expensive than coal in China, but the government is phasing out coal-fired boilers and switching to gas-fired ones, principally to help relieve air contamination in Beijing and other cities. The government is aiming to replace coal in textile factories.Under the country\u2019s five-year economic plan, through 2020, gas is the only fossil fuel that is supposed to increase its share in the energy consumption mix for heating, cooling and even commercial truck fleets \u2014 from 6 percent to up to 10 percent by 2020. Cheaper L.N.G. could also offset China\u2019s future dependence on piped Russian gas and force Russian companies to lower prices to stay competitive.In India, the energy agency projects an average growth of 6 percent annually of gas through 2022, in part driven by cheaper L.N.G. deliveries. Demand for it could increase by 11 percent annually.\u201cIn many cases the increased use of gas, particularly in some of the importing markets in Asia, has the potential to displace coal, so it can play a very positive role in mitigating the growth of emissions,\u201d said Tim Gould, a senior energy analyst at the energy agency.Only 15 countries imported liquefied gas in 2005. Twelve years later it has more than tripled, with such major economies as Pakistan, Thailand, Jordan, Egypt, Poland and Colombia becoming importers in the last few years.Bahrain, Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti, Namibia, Panama, the Philippines and Uruguay are building import terminals, according to the International Energy Agency.At the same time, gas demand for public transport is growing in Iran, Pakistan and Argentina.Germany has largely given up on nuclear power, and it needs natural gas without Russian strings to replace some of the lost power. African countries are beginning to deploy offshore modular terminals to import gas, which should help deliver power to rural villages, although the lack of pipelines will slow the process.Even Saudi Arabia is looking to invest in export terminals around the world to import gas to replace some of the oil the country burns for power.Such an investment, which could come with the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco planned for next year, could free significantly more oil on global markets.Many countries see the replacement by gas of coal and heating oil as a relatively painless way to reduce their carbon footprint, especially if potential methane leakage can be addressed. But many environmentalists say gas is only useful as a bridge fuel to a new age of renewables, if the bridge is short.Major oil companies are understandably bullish on gas in the hope that it extends their economic sustainability as the world moves to new, cleaner energy.\u201cIn the near term, gas will replace coal, in the medium term it will partner with renewables,\u201d said Maarten Wetselaar, director of integrated gas and new energies at Royal Dutch Shell, \u201cand in the long term it will take care of those parts of energy demand that cannot be electrified,\u201d such as ships and aircraft.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U., Citing Amazon and Apple, Tells Nations to Collect Tax", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European competition regulators on Wednesday mounted a push against tax avoidance by Silicon Valley giants, announcing plans to take Ireland to court for failing to collect back taxes from Apple and ordering Luxembourg to claim unpaid taxes from Amazon.Officials in Europe have been particularly focused on flexing their regulatory muscles against American technology companies, including assessing penalties for antitrust violations and opening investigations into the mishandling of customer data.Critics have argued that the measures show that the European Union is unfairly targeting such companies \u2014 an accusation that officials in Europe deny.The moves to address tax avoidance have special resonance in the region, much of which has endured painful austerity measures stemming from the financial crisis. Opponents of those measures complain that big companies have skirted their tax obligations, leaving small firms and individuals to make up the difference.European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.A year later, \u201cIreland has not recovered any money, not even in part,\u201d she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid \u201cmore conflictual waters,\u201d a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.At the time of the ruling, Europe\u2019s competition watchdogs said that Apple\u2019s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\u201dThe Irish Department of Finance said that it \u201chas never accepted the commission\u2019s analysis\u201d in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager\u2019s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had \u201cmade significant progress on this complex issue\u201d and accused the European authorities of taking a \u201cwholly unnecessary step.\u201dApple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had \u201cno valid economic justification\u201d and that the company had been able to \u201cavoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.\u201dAmazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.\u201cWe believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it \u201cpaid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\u201dAmazon said it would study the commission\u2019s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to \u201cillegal state aid.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. \u201cThe main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.\u201dA broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.\u201cThere are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,\u201d Mr. Fuest said.The European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc\u2019s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries.Advertisement"}

Colony has not and will not provide a cash infusion, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Wednesday to discuss private deliberations. It was unclear why the preliminary agreement had fallen apart.Colony, which has experience in distressed Hollywood assets, continues to explore the purchase of some or all of the Weinstein Company\u2019s assets. But Colony found more disorder than it had expected \u2014 and less value \u2014 once it started closely examining the studio\u2019s assets, according to two people who were briefed on the matter. They added that Colony saw bankruptcy as the most likely near-term outcome for the studio.Representatives for Colony and the Weinstein Company declined to comment.The Weinstein Company still has options. Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that has lent money to beleaguered film companies in the past, has been working on a potential financing package for the studio valued at roughly $35 million, which would provide enough liquidity for the studio to operate roughly through January, according to three people briefed on the matter.In her complaint, Ms. Huett said Mr. Weinstein had lured her to a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2010 with a promise to discuss acting roles and instead forced her to engage in sex acts. A spokesman for the Weinstein Company did not respond to requests for comment on the suit on Wednesday.Adding to the complexity, \u201cno one is interested in salvaging a company which would benefit Harvey,\u201d Mr. Barrack said. In other words: Would it be possible to structure a sale so that Mr. Weinstein did not benefit financially? Mr. Weinstein owns roughly 20 percent of the studio. His brother, Bob, owns an identical share. The rest is owned by about 25 investors, who hold portions of varying sizes.Several major entertainment companies have looked at buying pieces of the Weinstein Company and come away with mixed to negative reactions, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Lionsgate had interest in only one of the studio\u2019s coming films, \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d which is set for release in January. But even that family sequel has limited potential; the Weinstein Company mainly holds domestic rights.Endeavor, which owns the William Morris Endeavor talent agency and the IMG sports and fashion business, took a look at the Weinstein Company to see if there was a way to protect clients who have projects in the works there. But it concluded that clients should instead use legal tactics to pry projects loose.The Endeavor-related projects include a film adaptation of the musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d created by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes; a documentary about President Trump by Michael Moore; and a planned adaptation of \u201cThe Boys in the Boat,\u201d Daniel James Brown\u2019s book about the American rowing team that won a gold medal at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.The studio has made inroads in television, selling series to the likes of Amazon and Viacom and lining up potential shows with Showtime and Apple. But Amazon pulled the plug on its deal after the harassment scandal. Apple also walked away. Showtime said it would move forward with its project only if the Weinstein Company dropped out.Michael J. de la Merced and Kate Kelly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They\u2019ve got a gazillion users but they\u2019ve struggled on the revenue side.\u201dBoth of Mr. Dorsey\u2019s children, as he is known to refer to the companies, bear the imprint of their creator and his careful, trimmed-down aesthetic.At Square, Mr. Dorsey has led one of Silicon Valley\u2019s more understated success stories, built from the little plastic white square that allowed small businesses to accept credit card payments via their iPhones. Square has grown into a much broader financial services company, despite some hiccups, like a much-heralded partnership with Starbucks that flamed out.Although Twitter\u2019s overall revenue shrank 5 percent in the second quarter from the year before, expanding the company\u2019s losses, at Square, revenue grew 26 percent, moving the company closer to profitability.At Square, on the other hand, Mr. Dorsey was able to build the whole company from the ground up, with knowledge from Twitter of how things can go wrong.\u201cSquare wasn\u2019t Jack\u2019s first rodeo,\u201d said Randy Reddig, who was on the founding team at Square in 2009. \u201cIt was obvious early on at the company that he took lessons learned from his time at Twitter and applied them at Square.\u201dMr. Reddig said that Mr. Dorsey\u2019s education from Twitter\u2019s fractious early years was particularly apparent in the control that Mr. Dorsey kept over hiring and compensation decisions at Square, with a focus on creating a loyal team.Through Twitter and Square, Mr. Dorsey declined to comment for this article.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s success at Square and his trouble at Twitter also tell a broader story about Silicon Valley, where the boring, back-end businesses often end up generating more money than the flashy social networks and consumer services that capture the public\u2019s eye.Capgemini recently estimated that electronic payments should grow 10.9 percent a year between 2015 and 2020. It is no coincidence that the most successful American financial start-up of the last decade, aside from Square, is Stripe, which helps online businesses take payments.Beyond just payments, though, Square has taken aim at the much larger goal of providing a tech-savvy alternative to the big banks, expanding out from payments to lending and online deposits.This summer, Square applied for a bank charter in Utah, one of just three so-called fintech firms to take such a bold step (the others are Social Finance and Varo).Square is most visibly positioned to use a bank license with its business customers, but the company has also been building more banklike services for consumers, most notably with its app Square Cash.Square Cash is often described as a competitor and imitator of Venmo, the popular app owned by PayPal that makes it possible for friends to send one another payments by smartphone.In recent months, though, Square Cash has quietly bypassed Venmo to become the most frequently downloaded financial app of any kind on both Apple and Android phones, according to Apptopia. At various points over the past week, Square Cash was ahead of Venmo and Twitter on the charts of the most downloaded iPhone apps.The big banks had aimed to challenge Venmo with their own service, Zelle, but that has not posed a credible challenge to either Venmo or Square Cash so far, the rankings show.Mr. Dorsey and his team made several early design choices with Square Cash that helped make it different from Venmo. As would be expected from Mr. Dorsey, Square\u2019s app has a clean, green interface, compared with Venmo\u2019s busy blue dashboard.Square also made an apparently boring technical decision, to use the debit card networks rather than bank transfers, to move money around. That has made it easier for Square Cash to put money instantly into the bank accounts of its users, and to collect a fee for the service.These differences appear to have made Square Cash more popular with lower-income customers who more often need instant access to their money and who don\u2019t have as wide a variety of credit cards and other financial options.\u201cWe are reaching an audience that may not have a bank account or may not have a full suite of services from a bank,\u201d Mr. Dorsey told analysts last quarter.The shift in people using Square Cash as something more like a bank account has been an important one for Square\u2019s bottom line. While Square and PayPal generally don\u2019t make money when customers send money to one another, they can take a cut when customers start using the service to make payments at stores.This all looks like a similar playbook to the one Square used with its original credit card dongle, starting with a simple service for an underserved audience and then building from there.Keith Rabois, who was the chief operating officer at Square until 2013, said that the Cash app reflects Mr. Dorsey\u2019s ability to make deceptively simple products that answer a complicated need.Even though the revenue from Cash is small compared with the money that Square pulls in from businesses, Mr. Rabois said that \u201cit may be the most important thing Square is working on.\u201dDuring Mr. Rabois\u2019s tenure at Square, the future did not always look so bright. The company\u2019s first attempt at a consumer application, Square Wallet, never took off and was discontinued, bringing down the Starbucks partnership with it.Many analysts also expected that Square would have to reduce the price it charged businesses to process credit card transactions as it began working with larger businesses that had more options.Over time, though, Square has been able to keep its prices stable by offering its business customers other services, such as payroll and scheduling.A KeyBanc analyst recently polled 20 businesses that use Square and found that most of them had been offered lower card transaction fees by other companies but passed them up because of the add-ons that Square offers.One of the most profitable such services is Square Capital, which offers small loans to businesses. The revenue from these loans has been increasing faster than the overall growth of the company and has Square looking more like a bank every day.These days, one of the biggest concerns that analysts voice about Square is the time that Mr. Dorsey has to spend on Twitter, with all its problems.During a talk at Silicon Valley\u2019s Computer History Museum in August, Mr. Dorsey said he thought he had proved that he didn\u2019t need to make a choice between the two.\u201cThey both have different needs and are in different phases,\u201d he said. \u201cFocusing on one thing doesn\u2019t mean you completely lose sight of something else.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the firm where Ron Shevlin is the director of research. It is Cornerstone Advisors, not Capstone Advisors. The article also misstated how Jack Dorsey divides his workday. He typically works at Square in the afternoon and Twitter in the morning, not the other way around.Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter @nathanielpopperAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Google\u2019s Physical Keys Will Protect Your Password", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYet passwords remain the primary way we log in to online accounts containing our personal and financial information. Google has a new pragmatic solution: Embrace the password, but lock it down with extra physical security.This way, even if hackers stole your password in a data breach or successfully phished for it, by tempting you to hand over your credentials on a fake login page, they couldn\u2019t do anything unless they got their hands on the keys as well. And minimizing risk with minimal effort is a boon to anyone who cares about online security.\u201cI am a big fan of this,\u201d said John Sabin, a former hacker for the National Security Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the easiest and most secure multifactor for the masses.\u201dThe physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you. Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.The idea of Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message. Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group? Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.So we tested Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses. The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys. But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you. To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it. (The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.) This process takes a few minutes.On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins. That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.But there are trade-offs. Google\u2019s Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys. For the time being, that means only Google\u2019s Gmail mail app, Google\u2019s Backup and Sync app, and Google\u2019s Chrome browser.On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Google\u2019s Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser. So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, you\u2019re out of luck. Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A. hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons. On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.On the other hand, if you lose the keys or don\u2019t have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account. Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account. In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle. She said Google\u2019s requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account. That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Google\u2019s program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.\u201cIt\u2019s something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys,\u201d Ms. Sandvik said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason you shouldn\u2019t turn this on.\u201dWhile the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Google\u2019s apps from Apple\u2019s and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Google\u2019s mail, messaging and cloud storage services. But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature \u2014 Apple\u2019s V.I.P. alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you. Google\u2019s iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature. For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P. alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which won\u2019t work with the keys.If you decide to wait, don\u2019t procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages. While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well. When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Google\u2019s keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: \u201cNo comment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Said to Order Luxembourg to Collect Back Taxes From Amazon", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials will order Luxembourg to collect back taxes from the online retail giant Amazon, a source with knowledge of the decision said Tuesday, the latest in a series of moves where Brussels has sought to flex its regulatory muscle over Silicon Valley.It was not clear how much Luxembourg would be ordered to reclaim, according to the source, who did not want to be identified discussing information that was not yet public. Officials in Luxembourg and the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, declined to comment.The actions have highlighted the heightened scrutiny faced by low-tax nations in the European Union. Those countries, critics argue, help multinationals funnel revenues from larger markets in order to lower their overall tax bill. Such behavior has infuriated larger countries like France, whose budgets have been squeezed in recent years.At the time, the commission said that, in a deal struck in 2003, authorities in Luxembourg had conferred \u201can advantage on Amazon.\u201d The commission added that the \u201cadvantage is obtained every year and ongoing,\u201d and that it \u201cis also granted in a selective manner.\u201dAmazon does business across the 28-nation bloc, but lists its European headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000. The agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg effectively capped the amount of tax Amazon paid, and relied on a method called transfer pricing, according to the commission.Transfer pricing has long been used by multinational companies to assign profits to different units, depending on factors like their role in the overall business and assets. But, according to the commission, these rules are harder to apply for technology companies, because their assets, like intellectual property, are intangible.European regulators have claimed that Amazon sent most of its European revenue from one unit in Luxembourg to a separate subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax in the country. As a result, it was able to reduce the profit it generated from its European operations and cut its tax bill, the commission said.It is not illegal in the European Union for countries to try to lure businesses with low tax rates. But offering special deals to companies that are not available to their competitors can amount to what is known as illegal state aid.Both Amazon and Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry have previously denied that the online retail giant received special tax treatment or benefits.Amazon has already been in the commission\u2019s cross hairs this year for unfair competition.Efforts to curb multinationals from dodging tax have risen in prominence in recent months.Last month, the European Union began considering new proposals broadly aimed at tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.The prominence of Luxembourg has put Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in an awkward position: his role includes oversight of the investigations yet his critics accuse him of having helped turn Luxembourg into a tax haven during his nearly two decades leading that country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tech Is Starting to Make Me Uneasy", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s gadget season in the tech world. Think of it like New York Fashion Week, untucked white-man edition.But despite the baubles and billion-dollar office parks, I\u2019m really not feeling it this year. The technology industry is still exciting; it still packs the capacity for surprise. But where the surprise once felt like Christmas morning, it\u2019s now like the entering-the-darkened-basement scene of a horror movie.Technology has crossed over to the dark side. It\u2019s coming for you; it\u2019s coming for us all, and we may not survive its advance.I\u2019ve been covering tech for nearly 20 years; for the past three, since I inherited the State of the Art column from David Pogue, I\u2019ve explored for The New York Times how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future.Not only am I lucky enough to have my dream job, but it\u2019s perfectly timed, too. In the years that I\u2019ve written the column, the technology business has swallowed the world, becoming by far the largest and most consequential industry on the globe. Silicon Valley today is like Wall Street in the 1980s, or the defense industry in the 1950s: enjoying gargantuan growth and shaping much of the rest of the rest of the economy, not to mention art, culture, politics, education and healthcare.So why am I feeling so bad about tech?Well, who isn\u2019t, right? Look around you. It\u2019s difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when smartphones and social networks might be ruining the world. The technologies we were most excited about 10 years ago are now implicated in just about every catastrophe of the day. (See how Russian propagandists used Facebook and Twitter to inject false narratives into the news media last year.)These companies are not evil; they\u2019re all led and staffed by smart, well-meaning people who believe that technology can radically improve the world. But as I argue in the series, we have not, as a society, come to grips with the scope of their control over our lives. And we don\u2019t have many good ways to limit it, if we decided that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do.A lot of these worries aren\u2019t new. Though Silicon Valley runs on heedless optimism, much of The Times\u2019s coverage has long been properly skeptical and critical of the implications of new tech. Consider the evil of \u201crevenge porn,\u201d or the rise in accidents caused by drivers looking at their phones. I\u2019ve shared other fears: In 2008, I wrote a book predicting that the internet would lead us into a \u201cpost-fact\u201d world.Still, until this year, the problems caused by tech felt manageable \u2014 bumps on the road to a better tomorrow that we\u2019d eventually figure out. I managed to retain the capacity to be viscerally excited by tech, to instantly fall for its potential and possibilities. And I bought into it personally. You should see my house: I\u2019ve outfitted it with every kind of doodad you can imagine, including cameras that record everything we do, lights that switch on by voice, a toilet you have to plug in and, once, an electronic trashcan. (Manual is better, trust me.) There\u2019s a lot about it I now can\u2019t live without; every time I want to snap a picture of my kids, which is maybe five times an hour, I\u2019m grateful for the smartphone.And yet now it all comes freighted with worry. That\u2019s what\u2019s different. In 2007, when Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone, just about everyone greeted the new device as an unalloyed good. I was one of them. Here was a genuinely new thing that would Make Your Life Better, we all thought: It would be convenient, it would be fun, it wasn\u2019t serious or dangerous or globe-shattering. That\u2019s no longer true.The State of the Art, today, is a bag of mixed emotions. Tech might improve everything. And it\u2019s probably also terrible in ways we\u2019re only just starting to understand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s New Gadgets Come With a Big Helping of A.I.", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s unveiling of new smartphones, smart speakers and other gadgets had all the makings of a typical technology product launch: a fawning crowd of superfans, skeptical journalists, slick product videos, not-so-subtle jabs at the competition, and overly romanticized descriptions of design choices, colors and materials.But one nagging question lingered for Google, which makes nearly all of its money from selling online advertisements: Is it finally serious about making devices?On Wednesday, Google did its best to demonstrate its commitment. It introduced two new Pixel smartphones, Google Home speakers both small and large, a laptop running the company\u2019s Chrome software, a new virtual reality headset and wireless headphones.But Google\u2019s pitch for why its hardware is different had little to do with the hardware itself.Unlike the way an Apple event is conducted \u2014 usually chock-full of talk about chip speeds and screen resolutions \u2014 Google didn\u2019t spend much time on product specifications. Instead, its focus was on artificial intelligence. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, spent the first 10 minutes explaining how artificial intelligence was helping Google Maps and its translations.Mr. Pichai said that as an \u201cA.I. first\u201d company, this is a \u201cunique moment in time\u201d for Google to combine hardware, software and artificial intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s radically rethinking how computing should work,\u201d he said.Google executives said it has been getting harder to find new hardware breakthroughs like bigger and better screens, but they believe significant improvements will come from artificial intelligence software that is developing at a faster clip than physical components.Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president of hardware, compared the company\u2019s strategy for building devices to search and email. Google was not the first search engine and Gmail was hardly the first free web-based email provider \u2014 but both services reimagined what those products should do.On Wednesday, Google demonstrated how every hardware product had received an A.I. makeover. The Pixel smartphones come with an image-recognition app called Lens that can help users find information just by pointing a camera at a movie poster or an ad. The new \u201csmart speaker\u201d uses artificial intelligence to adjust its sound for the layout of a room. And new wireless headphones allow for instant translation of different languages.The question of Google\u2019s commitment to hardware is a testament to the challenges of competing against devices made by Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Most other companies have found it hard to turn a profit in that product fight, and a flop can follow a company around for years \u2014 both in money and reputation lost.It is also a recognition of Google\u2019s history of fits and starts with devices. The company once acquired Motorola, only to sell it a few years later to Lenovo. It bought Nest and Dropcam, but the introduction of new products from those home device companies seemed to stagnate after they joined Google, now operating under the parent company, Alphabet.Whether Google\u2019s device push sticks over the long haul remains to be seen, but its checkbook for hardware is still open.The deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval, early next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose Situation", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But so what? Hasn\u2019t that always been the case?As the men who run Silicon Valley will be the first to tell you, a company\u2019s size doesn\u2019t matter here. For every lumbering Goliath, there are always one or two smarter, faster Davids just now starting up in some fabled garage, getting ready to slay the giants when they least expect it.Well, maybe not this time.The technology industry is now a playground for giants. Where 10 or 20 years ago we looked to start-ups as a font of future wonders, today the energy and momentum have shifted almost completely to the big guys. In addition to the many platforms they own already, one or more of the Five are on their way to owning artificial intelligence, voice assistants, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, home automation, and every other cool and crazy thing that will rule tomorrow.The best start-ups keep being scooped up by the big guys (see Instagram and WhatsApp, owned by Facebook). Those that escape face merciless, sometimes unfair competition (their innovations copied, their projects litigated against). And even when the start-ups succeed, the Five still win.Because today\u2019s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don\u2019t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition \u2014 they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.The small guys won\u2019t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don\u2019t have the whole game won.They said the Five\u2019s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five\u2019s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren\u2019t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.\u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019d say it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, \u2018Why won\u2019t Microsoft do your business?\u2019 Then six years later it was, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Google do it?\u2019 Now it\u2019s a combination of why can\u2019t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?\u201dMr. Levin\u2019s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller\u2019s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day\u2019s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.IAC\u2019s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie\u2019s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five \u2014 both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that\u2019s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys \u2014 for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms \u2014 because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.\u201cWe think that a smart voice provider will say, \u2018If I want to win at all costs, we\u2019ll go get the very best partner\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s us,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn\u2019t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It\u2019s not betting on their demise; rather, it\u2019s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.IAC\u2019s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. \u201cI think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia \u2014 whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.\u201cI\u2019m mixed as it relates to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers \u2014 and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.\u201dBut like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here\u2019s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.Advertisement"}

Ted Sarandos, the company\u2019s chief content officer, said that Netflix released eight films this quarter. By the end of next year, he expects the streaming service to release 80 original movies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Alternate Universe of Shopping, in Ohio", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 It was a scorching day outside, hot even for late summer in Ohio, and yet I was freezing. I had stepped inside the EB Ice Box, a meat-locker-like display at the Eddie Bauer store here that was cooled to 13 degrees Fahrenheit. The metal-sheathed room looked out onto the promenade of an upscale shopping mall, and featured a large block of ice for a bench. Even though I was wearing a down jacket (the room is meant to be a place where customers can test Eddie Bauer wear), the frigid air had gotten under my skin.The ice box was a gambit designed to attract the one thing so many stores like Eddie Bauer seem to be missing these days \u2014 customers.For shoppers, this city of 860,000 smack in the middle of a swing state, can feel like an alternate reality, a place where up is down and down is up. Frumpy department stores feature personal shopping services and boutique wellness amenities. Workaday grocery stores like Kroger offer exotic fruits and freshly baked artisan breads.Even the fast-food business is living in the future. McDonald\u2019s is offering table service from friendly waiters. Robots are taking orders at Wendy\u2019s. Chipotle started a chain that serves hamburgers.That kind of experimentation has long been a feature of the Columbus shopping scene, but these days it stems as much from desperation as from innovation. The physical retail market, crumbling in the face of competition from e-commerce sites, is in the midst of a transformation as fundamental as the one that shifted consumers to suburban shopping malls \u2014 and away from Main Street \u2014 half a century ago.Upstart brands powered by social media are stealing customers from established companies, and the carnage is widespread. More than a dozen major retailers, from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us to Payless ShoeSource, have sought bankruptcy protection this year. Thousands of stores have closed.Now, as brick-and-mortar retailers around the country stumble, the experimentation has taken on new urgency. Stores are trying out all manner of gimmickry \u2014 anything, really \u2014 to win back shoppers. And when brands want to try out new concepts, they often come to Columbus.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect melting pot for folks like us to test new concepts,\u201d said Roger Rawlins, chief executive of DSW, the shoe retailer, which is based in Columbus.Ohio State University\u2019s 65,000 students mean young shoppers are always on hand. Columbus is within a day\u2019s drive of nearly half of the United States population, making it a convenient hub for distribution. The city\u2019s relatively small size and contained media market make it affordable for companies to run advertising campaigns and measure their effectiveness. And its relatively low profile allows brands to try something and fail \u2014 without the scrutiny they would draw in New York or Los Angeles.Perhaps most important, a robust network of retailers and service providers \u2014 from big brands like Abercrombie & Fitch to small design firms that focus on store layouts \u2014 has taken root in Columbus. Today there are more fashion designers in Columbus than in any other American city besides New York and Los Angeles.But despite the central role that Columbus plays in the retail industry, there are no clear signs that all this experimentation will be able to save the hometown brands. Half a dozen major retailers \u2014 from Abercrombie & Fitch to the parent company of Victoria\u2019s Secret \u2014 have their headquarters in Columbus. Just about all of them have suffered significant declines in their market value over the past year. Retail employment is falling.Local boosters put an optimistic Midwestern spin on the situation. \u201cA lot of the challenges that retailers are grappling with, there\u2019s a whole ecosystem of companies here who are working on fixing that,\u201d Ms. Alvarez said. And in Columbus and beyond, there is much about the retail business that needs fixing.Shoppers in Columbus once flocked to two malls, Eastland and Westland. Two decades ago, both were thriving retail temples, anchored by department stores, stuffed with windowless shops and served by mediocre food courts.On the other side of town, Eastland is not faring much better. Most of the big brands have moved out, leaving just a collection of eyebrow salons, discount retailers and off-brand fast-food providers.\u201cThere are a lot of zombie malls out there,\u201d said Steve Morris, a co-founder of the Asset Strategies Group, a Columbus firms that helps companies manage their real estate holdings. \u201cWe\u2019re just over-retailed in the U.S.\u201dYaromir Steiner, a real estate developer, concurred \u201cWe\u2019ve been building malls like there\u2019s no tomorrow,\u201d said Mr. Steiner, chief executive of Steiner & Associates. \u201cAmerica overbuilt.\"Yet Mr. Steiner, it could be argued, is partly responsible for the slow demise of centers like Eastland and Westland. He is a disrupter in the mall industry, and his most successful development, Easton Town Center, on the northeast edge of the city, serves a vital role in the test market ecosystem.In the early 1990s, Mr. Steiner, a Turkish immigrant, was an aspiring developer in Miami. Asked to help develop a shopping center in the upscale Coconut Grove neighborhood, he took a cue from the bustling open-air commercial districts of Istanbul. Instead of building a big box and stuffing stores inside, he proposed turning the mall inside out, placing shops along tree-lined pathways and bringing in upscale restaurants with outdoor seating.Working with some of the most influential retail forces in Columbus, Mr. Steiner designed and now manages Easton Town Center, a development that is less a mall than a small city. In addition to hundreds of stores, there are millions of square feet of office space, restaurants, apartments and hotel rooms.It was hardly a guaranteed success. \u201cA guy with an accent comes from Miami and says we\u2019ll do an open-air project in a place that gets 40 inches of snow?\u201d Mr. Steiner said. \u201cI didn\u2019t stand the chance of a snowball in hell.\u201dEaston Town Center is also where many retailers do their experimenting. The Eddie Bauer store is there. Nearby, an explosion of neon lighting and skimpy lingerie signals the presence of a La Senza store, a Canadian brand that is just being introduced to the United States. And around the corner, Lane Bryant, the plus-size women\u2019s clothing company, has introduced LaneStyle Studio, a personal shopping program that offers customers one-on-one appointments.Also at Polaris, Mr. Rawlins, the chief executive of DSW, is tinkering with his own business model. At a location he calls \u201cthe lab store,\u201d Mr. Rawlins is testing new offerings including shoe rental, shoe storage and cobbler services, even a nail salon.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for other ways to retain our customers,\u201d he said.Les Wexner, a Columbus native, remembers that when he attended Ohio State University in the late 1950s, his professors told him an unusual fact: Columbus was a major test market for consumer goods companies. When corporations wanted to see if a new soap or detergent would have broad appeal, they came to Columbus.A few years later, Mr. Wexner opened his first women\u2019s clothing store in town, calling it The Limited. As the company expanded, he took his education to heart, trying out new styles and store designs in his hometown before rolling them out to new markets.\u201cBefore I even started the business, Columbus was a great test market,\u201d Mr. Wexner said in an interview. \u201cThe customers here were average, and the thinking was that things they liked or rejected would be predictive for the rest of the country.\u201dThe strategy worked. The Limited grew into a retail behemoth. Over the years, Mr. Wexner acquired some brands and introduced others, and at one time or another owned Lane Bryant, Abercrombie & Fitch and Express under the umbrella of his company, L Brands. All along the way, he tested new ideas.\u201cLes was never satisfied,\u201d said Denny Gerdeman, who once designed stores for Mr. Wexner and is now a co-founder of the Columbus design firm Chute Gerdeman. \u201cEvery six months we had to redesign the stores.\u201dMr. Wexner, the longest-serving chief executive of a major American company and a billionaire many times over, is not particularly modest about his accomplishments.\u201cWalt Disney invented characters, and I invent businesses,\u201d Mr. Wexner said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly inventing, reinventing and spinning off businesses.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Wexner made his fortune with a preternatural ability to see retail\u2019s future. He anticipated the rise of casual attire, spotted underappreciated brands and knew when to sell them off before they lost their luster.Mr. Wexner\u2019s penchant for experimentation extended beyond his stores, too. It was he, along with a developer called the Georgetown Company, who called up Mr. Steiner in Miami and helped develop Easton Town Center.Over the years, Mr. Wexner spun off most of the brands he had acquired, seeding Columbus with a new crop of independent companies that in turn tossed off their own spinoffs and imitators. And over the years, an industry emerged. In same way that Hewlett-Packard gave birth to Silicon Valley\u2019s technology sector, Mr. Wexner\u2019s relentless deal making has spawned a network of companies that now shapes people\u2019s tastes from coast to coast.Today the L Brands headquarters share a campus with Express, which is now a public company of its own. The Abercrombie & Fitch headquarters are a short drive away.\u201cIt all stems from Les Wexner,\u201d said Steve Zawada, chief operating officer at Eloquii, a plus-size women\u2019s clothing company based in Columbus.But with few exceptions, the industry that Columbus helped create is now under threat. After years of job gains, retail employment in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, has decreased over the last year, according to the Columbus Chamber of Commerce. Today, retailers employ some 68,000 people, down from more than 93,000 in 2001.Shares of Express are down about 45 percent this year. Ascena, the Columbus company that now owns Lane Bryant, has seen its stock plummet by 69 percent over the same time. And Abercrombie & Fitch and DSW have also fallen over the last full year.Even Mr. Wexner\u2019s company, after decades of success, appears to be in decline. Shares of L Brands, which today includes Victoria\u2019s Secret, Bath & Body Works, Henri Bendel and La Senza, have fallen by 42 percent over the past year. Sales at Victoria\u2019s Secret were down 12 percent from last year through September, as women buy their lingerie elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m perfectly willing to accept that women may never wear bras,\u201d Mr. Wexner said, tossing aside the notion that his products might one day be obsolete. \u201cBut probably women will still wear bras. The categories we are in we think have futures.\u201dOlder brands can only hope for such happy problems, and instead are left trying to innovate their way back to relevance.Smaller details are being tinkered with, too. The trays have higher edges to reduce spills. Fries are served in cups instead of sleeves. Through a partnership with the digital music service Pandora, Wendy\u2019s curates the restaurant\u2019s playlist based on what people in a five-mile radius are listening to. There is even counter seating that looks into the Wendy\u2019s kitchen, where line cooks are preparing salads made to order \u2014 a first for the chain.\u201cCustomers have a certain idea about what they think fast-food restaurants are,\u201d said Abigail Pringle, chief development officer at Wendy\u2019s, which is based in the Columbus region. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to shake that up.\u201dThen there is the EB Ice Box. Colin Berg, Eddie Bauer\u2019s brand historian, said the idea was actually an old one. In the 1950s, Eddie Bauer himself would instruct employees to spend time in cold storage lockers and make sure the company\u2019s parkas kept them warm.But the company may have to do more than install a nifty in-store display to ensure a successful future. Mr. Berg said \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d suggested that the EB Ice Box had been a hit with customers, who enjoy popping in for a blast of arctic air. Yet on a series of recent afternoons, the EB Ice Box, along with the Eddie Bauer store itself, was mostly empty.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "By DesignWith his love of brass, arches and color, Harry Nuriev creates environments that seem tailor-made for the social media aesthetic.Supported byThe aesthetic, you might say, is global minimalism \u2014 softened with pastel colors and curves. It pulls from postwar Scandinavian furniture, \u201980s postmodernism, the spareness of Japanese design and various art-world references, like Bauhaus and neoplasticism. You can find the style (as distinctive as it is unnamed) in homes, studios, hotels and cafes in Paris and Los Angeles, Brooklyn and Barcelona; much as the \u201990s consolidation of stations by corporate-owned radio filed away local flavor on the airwaves, the prevalence of this look on social media and #IRL \u2014 in real life \u2014 has had a homogenizing effect on design.The 33-year-old Russian architect and furniture designer Harry Nuriev has emerged as one of the style\u2019s masters. Like his contemporaries \u2014 Brooklyn-based Bower, Milan-based Studiopepe, Los Angeles-based Etc.etera \u2014 he pairs the high polish of brass with rough-hewn materials (broken ceramics, raw ceilings), returns often to the natural curve of the arch (\u201cit\u2019s the shape of the human body,\u201d he says) and has used millennial pink (before it was called that, mind you) on everything from fur chairs to bathroom walls.You can see examples of this in his apartment, a small prewar one-bedroom (his \u201cdacha\u201d) throughout which that now-infamous pink appears often. There\u2019s a modular bookshelf that resembles an Italian Fascist building, with spinning components inspired by a Lazy Susan, and a chair that is reminiscent of one of Donald Judd\u2019s cubes; Nuriev made both from rose-gold stainless steel. A tenement window separating the kitchen and the dining room has been fitted with a piece of pink Plexiglas that makes the room beyond look flushed.When it comes to color, Nuriev is a serial monogamist. \u201cColors to me are like people,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I fall in love, I try to make the relationship work.\u201d Pink was a great passion, but his latest obsession is royal blue \u2014 a flat, bright shade that, along with the brass he favors, was once a symbol of czarist Russia.In the kitchen, the appliances are hidden in twin blue cabinets; the faucet and sink have been powder-coated the same hue. In the airy front room, the low-slung sectional sofa is nothing more than blue vinyl cushions topped with blue cotton pillows. The adjacent blue coffee table is one of the three-legged stainless steel pieces, \u201c1 on 2\u201d and \u201c2 on 1,\u201d for which Nuriev is known, and which are sold by Not So General in West Hollywood. In the dining room, there are six chairs of the same color and design \u2014 where one leg is an arch that ingeniously doubles as the back \u2014 set around a long, blue-flecked marble table. In both the dining room and the kitchen hang pendant lamps Nuriev created out of blue-capped Bic pens. \u201cWhy these particular pens?\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cFirst of all, all Soviet kids had pens like these in school. Second, it\u2019s my color.\u201dMANY OF US, let\u2019s admit it, have gone to a museum or ordered dessert simply to post the experience on social media. Likewise, many interiors on Instagram seem to have been created with a future photo in mind. But these spaces frequently feel inert, overly composed; there is none of the sense of life, of organic coherence, that accrues over time in a place that\u2019s actually been inhabited, not just arranged for a picture. Nuriev\u2019s apartment is certainly photogenic \u2014 he has a knack for dividing spaces with color-blocking, essentially creating areas made to be framed \u2014 but it also radiates an air of imperfect coziness. That human touch is evident in the black plastic hand-shaped chair he found on the street, or the bowl of McIntosh apples that sits on his desk because their scent reminds him of growing up in Stavropol, an agricultural hub in the Caucasus. Even as his apartment serves as his showroom \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s not like a website where you go and see pictures,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s honest.\u201dFor Nuriev, honesty \u2014 that intangible virtue \u2014 is fundamental to good design. \u201cThis sofa,\u201d he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, \u201cit\u2019s pure function, but it\u2019s still beautiful.\u201d His goal when designing a room, he says, is to \u201cleave only what\u2019s only useful.\u201d He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a \u201cmachine for living.\u201d These are often the references for Nuriev\u2019s cohort of global minimalists, even if they don\u2019t always realize it. \u201cSo many people are riffing on things they don\u2019t know about,\u201d says Patrick Parrish, Nuriev\u2019s New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins. \u201cHarry\u2019s not like that. He knows exactly what he\u2019s referencing.\u201dThis style, in part, follows last decade\u2019s midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting. It\u2019s also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration. Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, they\u2019ve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Marg\u2019s apartment. And then there\u2019s the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, don\u2019t require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because \u201cit was very classic \u2014 Roman, Italian, Greek,\u201d and he wanted to figure out how to \u201cuse it in real life, to make it sexy.\u201d He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, \u201cit looked weird.\u201d The pink, likewise, \u201clooked girlish,\u201d and people would ask him why he was using it. \u201cIt\u2019s not that everybody copied me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I sensed something.\u201dWhat\u2019s difficult to spot are references to Nuriev\u2019s Russian upbringing, but they\u2019re in fact there, if quietly. On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls \u201cthe Patti Smith of Russia.\u201d Above the sofa, he\u2019s taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhood\u2019s Russian Orthodox Church: \u201cIn Russia,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.\u201d His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.In his home office, there\u2019s a mood board on which he\u2019s pinned sketches for his latest project, to be shown at Design Miami in December. For the first time, he\u2019ll embrace his heritage directly: Nuriev is working with Russian tinsmiths to create a series of lamps based on traditional chimneys. The artisanal latticework is beautiful and ornate \u2014 a clear departure from his bright minimalism. But the lacelike shadows they cast are no less Instagram-worthy.Before I leave, he shows me images of a beauty salon called Bronze Glow he designed in Moscow, with his signature high-low contrast of shiny fixtures and crumbling walls. The salon\u2019s bathroom is entirely red: ceiling, walls, everything. \u201cI think red is my next color,\u201d Nuriev says. I ask what draws him to a color and when he knows one\u2019s played out. \u201cIt\u2019s like any relationship,\u201d he says. \u201cYou will never know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.\u201cIt is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill. In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business,\u201d Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, \u201cand that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.\u201dThe tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well. In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission. In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.\u201cIn the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Google and Facebook and the future of the news business,\u201d Mr. Chavern said in an interview before the hearing.Even nonprofit consumer interest groups are taking advantage of the situation. John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, who is a longtime critic of Google\u2019s collection of personal data, has pushed for online privacy rules and restrictions for self-driving vehicles. He has struggled to get attention in the past, but that is not much of a problem now.\u201cI\u2019m getting more calls these days,\u201d Mr. Simpson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies? Don\u2019t Bet on It", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. They\u2019re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won\u2019t.The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives \u2014 when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms \u2014 Americans turned to their government for a fix.Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants\u2019 power through government \u2014 and, if so, how.On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five \u2014 Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.But there is little to suggest we\u2019ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants\u2019 vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.\u201cIndividuals, lawmakers, we\u2019re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable \u2014 so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.\u201cOur firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cFolks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I\u2019d bet a lot of money a year from now we\u2019ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.\u201dPart of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we\u2019ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They\u2019re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five\u2019s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.\u201cWe\u2019ve all become a bit cyborg,\u201d writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d one of several new books examining the giants. \u201cWhat we need to always remember is that we\u2019re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.\u201dYet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it\u2019s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn\u2019t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn\u2019t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government\u2019s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company\u2019s culture \u2014 which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today\u2019s tech giants. But that\u2019s a big if.\u201cThe big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cHad we been more diligent, we wouldn\u2019t have nearly the problems we have today.\u201dFollow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
