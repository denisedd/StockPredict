{"Headline": "Protect Alaska\u2019s Last Great Wilderness From Oil Drilling", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsFew landscapes remain virtually untrammeled by the growing impact of the planet\u2019s seven and a half billion inhabitants \u2014 places where the natural environment is so overwhelmingly intact and truly wild that coming across so much as a boot print is a surprise. It seems unlikely in this day and age, but such areas do still exist.The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one such place. Lies and misrepresentations have characterized this Arctic region as a \u201cbarren wasteland.\u201d In fact, this is a landscape of surprising beauty and biological diversity: 31,000 square miles of the craggy Brooks Range, valleys of spruce forest and flower-filled tundra extending north to the Arctic Ocean.In this terrain and the adjacent Arctic Ocean, you\u2019ll find roughly 700 kinds of plants and a multitude of different species: 200 bird, 47 mammal and 42 fish species. It\u2019s a place of living grandeur.Those of us who have explored the Arctic refuge treasure seeing grizzly bears, wolves, Dall sheep and thundering herds of caribou. With awe we have watched golden eagles and flocks of migrating birds from across the globe, many of which nest there in the summer after a winter spent in such faraway places as the Amazon, the coastal wetlands of Patagonia or the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bangladesh.Yet this stunning landscape is now in the cross hairs of the United States Congress. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to allow oil drilling in the refuge in order to generate revenue to offset the cost of tax reform. This expedited process allows Republicans in the Senate, where they hold a narrow edge, to pass a reconciliation bill with a simple majority, bypassing a filibuster from the Democrats. This is not the way we should consider a measure that threatens irreversible damage to our wilderness heritage.The refuge was originally suggested for protection in the early 1950s, when Alaska was not yet a state. To investigate its conservation value, Olaus Murie, the president of the Wilderness Society, and his wife, Mardy, who both had spent years in Alaska, suggested a biological survey to Fairfield Osborn, president of the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society). The Sheenjek River Valley and surrounding areas on the southern slopes of the Brooks Range were selected as the focus of the expedition.In the summer of 1956 the Muries and a team \u2014 consisting of the ornithologist Brina Kessel from the University of Alaska, along with graduate students Robert Krear and one of us (Dr. Schaller) \u2014 roamed these remote mountains. They made lists of plants and animals and absorbed, in Olaus Murie\u2019s words, \u201cthe precious intangible values\u201d of the place.As early as 1952, Dr. Schaller noted that oil development had already begun in northern Alaska. He wrote the secretary of interior, Fred Seaton, warning that unless the region were shielded from development it \u201cmay in future years resemble one of the former Texas oil fields.\u201dIn 1960, the Eisenhower administration established the nearly nine million acre Arctic National Wildlife Range to preserve \u201cthe unique wildlife, wilderness and recreational values\u201d of this landscape.Congress and the Carter administration doubled the size of the refuge, to 18 million acres, in 1980 under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, renaming the area as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. (With an addition, it is now 19.6 million acres.) Native people retained their hunting rights, and licensed trophy hunters were permitted to kill Dall sheep and caribou.The refuge also includes the 1.5 million acre \u201c1002 area\u201d adjoining the Arctic Ocean. This swath of coastal plain is thought to be rich in oil and gas, and even though vast portions of the Arctic slope and coastal waters of northern Alaska are open for oil leasing and drilling, the Trump administration, and oil interests and their allies in Congress want to invade and squander this pristine area, which takes up less than 5 percent of the coastal plain.This part of the Arctic slope extending northward from the Brooks Range to the Arctic Ocean is a critical site for polar bears to make their dens and give birth. It is also the calving ground of America\u2019s largest caribou herd, which migrates widely through the region. The Gwich\u2019in Indians of Arctic Village in the Brooks Range and the Inupiat of Kaktovik on the coastal plain depend on the animal for food and clothing.The Gwich\u2019in call the calving area that oil companies hope to develop \u201cthe sacred place where life begins.\u201d As Trimble Gilbert, chief of Arctic Village, said: \u201cWe hurt because we see the land being destroyed,\u201d and added that \u201cwe believe we have something to teach the world about living a simple life, about sharing, about protecting the land.\u201dOn the 50th anniversary of the Murie expedition in 2006, the explorer and author Jonathan Waterman organized a return trip to the Arctic refuge. We joined the team, along with graduate students Forrest McCarthy and Betsy Young.It was exhilarating for Dr. Schaller to return after 50 years and still find no roads, no buildings, no garbage. On the Sheenjek River, even an eagle nest he had seen on a cliff in 1956 was still there. Arctic loons still called near our camp on Last Lake, and caribou continued to meander across the coastal plain as we floated first the Canning and then the Hula Hula Rivers.On this trip, we visited the famous Prudhoe Bay oil field on the Arctic slope. After a major petroleum discovery in 1968, an 800-mile pipeline was constructed to transport oil to southern Alaska. Oil started flowing in 1977. Look at Prudhoe Bay and all its satellite fields now. Those who treasure the splendor of industrial sprawl must visit this morass of pipe lines, buildings drilling rigs, gravel pits, roads and pools of toxic chemicals.Prudhoe Bay is the largest oil field in North America and one of the top 20 globally. It has undoubtedly brought wealth and prosperity to Alaska, but spills of oil and chemicals, large and small, take place each year. Various laws require that this region be cleaned up once the oil has been exhausted. But who will pay for that in this pro-development world is anyone\u2019s guess.The Arctic refuge must continue to be preserved as a symbol of America\u2019s natural heritage. It remains a healthy ecosystem supporting wildlife, and native peoples as they adapt to profound climate-related changes. True wilderness holds a spiritual value that can nourish us. That is why the American public enjoys its national parks, monuments and other protected areas.There will always be pro-development forces and those with political agendas who are prepared to dismantle, cripple, gut and destroy our natural heritage for short-term gain, heedless of the long-term cost to us as a civilization. In that effort they forget that everything we want, need and have comes from nature.Congress should stop its headlong rush to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration and extraction. Surely patriotism encompasses the protection of the most pristine and beautiful representations of America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No, That Robot Will Not Steal Your Job", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe recovery from the crisis of 2008 has been one of the weakest on record, but never in postwar history has so little growth created so many jobs. The unemployment rate in the developed world is down to 5.5 percent and approaching a 40-year low. This flies in the face of all the dire warnings about a \u201cjobless future.\u201dThere are jobs, jobs everywhere. Unemployment in Germany is now lower than at any point since the country reunified in 1990. It is hitting lows last seen in 1975 in Britain and 1994 in Japan. The United States jobs report on Friday showed a slip in job creation, a result of the devastation of the recent hurricanes, but unemployment dropped yet again, to just 4.2 percent from 4.4 percent, both lows rarely seen in the past half-century.How is it that the aftermath of 2008 could do so much damage to the economy, yet lead to such a low unemployment rate? One answer is demographics: The world is aging, and the number of people entering the work force every year is slowing sharply. A striking example is Japan, which has one of the oldest and most rapidly aging populations in the world; the economy is barely growing, but the jobs market is booming, and unemployment is now under 3 percent.The other basic answer is churn. The popular angst about jobs focuses on shuttered stores along Main Street and factories in the Rust Belt but overlooks the new openings. Many of those new jobs are in fields that require creativity, language or motor skills not possessed by robots, like gardening, nursing, teaching and software programming.The pessimist\u2019s basic mistake is to focus too much on what is lost to competition and technology, and too little on what is gained. Over the past 25 years, as McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, has pointed out, about a third of the new jobs created in the United States were types that did not exist or barely existed 25 years ago.In the natural world, matter is neither created nor destroyed, but things are transformed. The same is true in the economic world. When new technology destroys, it leaves behind a layer of ash in which new jobs grow.In New York City the car replaced the horse carriage within the first 15 years of the 20th century, killing off the carriage trade and giving birth to the taxi trade \u2014 as well as to highly paid auto mechanics. Uber threatens the taxi trade, and the self-driving car threatens the Uber driver. But it has also brought multimillion-dollar signing bonuses for self-driving-car engineers and created new opportunities for mechanics. People tend to find a way to work with and profit from new technology.Doomsayers argue that Uber epitomizes the problem: Yes it creates new jobs, but they are mainly low-wage, part-time and without much in the way of benefits. Even the better jobs, like self-driving-auto engineer, are so few that they only widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.The percentage of companies that report difficulty finding qualified workers is back to levels last hit before the Great Recession, and many have responded with plans to increase wages and signing bonuses \u2014 \u201cpossible harbingers of stronger wage gains to come,\u201d according to Ms. Yellen. The latest jobs report confirmed her optimism, with hourly wages rising 2.9 percent from last year, the fastest rate yet recorded in this recovery.The dire view taken by economic populists and writers denouncing the rise of the robots is no longer the view of most American households. The share of workers who are in part-time jobs has actually been falling since 2010, and the number of reluctant part-time workers \u2014 those who would prefer full-time work \u2014 has fallen to five million from around nine million. The number of discouraged workers \u2014 people who have given up looking \u2014 has fallen back to levels last seen before the 2008 recession.United States consumer confidence, which often reflects trends in the job market, is at a peak surpassed only a few times since the early 1960s.There are still reasonable questions about whether many jobs of the future will be well paid. But there is no evidence so far to support forecasts of a nearly jobless future. If robots threatened human labor, human joblessness would be growing. But it\u2019s not. In fact, since 2008, job growth has been strongest in countries like Germany and Japan, which deploy the most robots.The pain being felt right now is a symptom of rapid churn, as old industries retreat and new ones emerge. It is no accident that dystopian visions of a jobless future are often reported from Rust Belt cities or rural towns, where manufacturing is indeed dying and good jobs are far from plentiful. But at least some of the workers laid off by shuttered Main Street stores have been hired by Amazon warehouses, which can pay higher wages \u2014 all because they work with robots that make them much more productive.Today, many politicians and editorial writers frame every policy proposal, from cutting taxes to raising trade barriers, in terms of the number of jobs it will create. But they should recognize that while the world faces many problems, from rising inequality to angry economic populism, job creation is not one of them.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rupi Kaur Is Kicking Down the Doors of Publishing", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Monday, about 1,000 people, most of them young women, lined up at a New York City theater for a poetry reading by Rupi Kaur. Giant fake sunflowers outside made a safe space for guests to pose for Instagram in their hijabs, baseball caps, pantsuits, combat boots and cocktail dresses.\u201cInstagram makes my work so accessible and I was able to build a readership,\u201d Ms. Kaur said recently in a cafe in SoHo. \u201cBut then I always feel like within the literary world there\u2019s of course downsides, because you have that label attached to your work and then, for some reason, that means you aren\u2019t a credible literary source.\u201dMs. Kaur appended a note: \u201ci will not apologize for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in an underwear but not be okay with a small leak.\u201dMs. Kaur too has been accused of writing about experiences that she hasn\u2019t had herself. Asked about this, she shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated,\u201d she said. It\u2019s also not, historically, a requirement for poetry. Writing poems is how she processes the news and the world around her, she said, and for what she hasn\u2019t lived, she tries to understand.The underlying message of all this criticism is that Ms. Kaur\u2019s work isn\u2019t \u201creal literature.\u201d The literary world doesn\u2019t have a great track record of embracing or even acknowledging artists like Ms. Kaur, who are different in some notable way, but who attract an enormous and fervent audience.\u201cCritics might think that Kaur\u2019s readership is young and female, so her work can\u2019t be serious, which is obviously wrong,\u201d said Matthew Hart, a professor of English and comparative literature Columbia University. \u201cHer style doesn\u2019t seem na\u00efve.\u201dJane Austen, Dr. Hart said, was \u201cone of the most important figures in allowing us to get over the idea that the ordinary business of ordinary young women\u2019s lives can\u2019t be the topic of important art.\u201dBut Austen died 200 years ago. Ms. Kaur\u2019s work reminds us that the ordinary business and experience of millennial minority women is not to be dismissed.I spoke with dozens of Ms. Kaur\u2019s fans and critics, most of them young women. Those who dislike her work agree with enthusiasts that she\u2019s addressing weighty issues like violence, sexual assault and trauma in a way that is admirable.\u201cWe\u2019re best friends and we\u2019ve been apart for two years, but we\u2019d send each other her poems on Instagram when one of us was feeling down or lonely,\u201d said Katharina Gadow, 28, who attended Ms. Kaur\u2019s reading with a friend who had just moved to New York.For Shannon Donnelly, 24, \u201cMilk and Honey\u201d was \u201csometimes difficult to read\u201d because she has struggled with depression and anxiety. Ultimately, reading the book was like \u201cworking through my pains with a therapist,\u201d she said.Ms. Kaur has \u201chit the nail on the head in every single way,\u201d said Tiffany Praimnath, 19. \u201cGuyanese culture is reminiscent of Indian culture to me, especially how men treat women, and I think because Rupi\u2019s of Indian ancestry, that really resonated.\u201dMany fans told me they share her poems with friends via Instagram or screen shots sent as texts, as encouragement or as a way to let Ms. Kaur\u2019s work speak for them. Ms. Kaur becomes permission and voice both, a reminder and a vehicle that they have every right to speak, even when they are made to feel like they should be silent. Organizations including the National Eating Disorders Association, Moms Can Code, and Curvy Girls Scoliosis all broadcast Ms. Kaur\u2019s work on social media as encouragement, solidarity or motivation.Two chapters of her new book were written after Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration. In them she tells the story of her family. Poems about her ancestors and her mother\u2019s bravery in leaving Punjab read as thank-you notes.\u201cI wonder what it was like for my mom,\u201d Ms. Kaur said. \u201cHow the hell did she pick up, move and do that all by herself?\u201dThe gratitude she feels to her parents for working hard and giving her the opportunity to get an education will resonate with children of immigrants. It\u2019s hard to ignore the power of such work in a moment when the White House pushes for mass deportations of people like Ms. Kaur\u2019s family. Her father, Suchet Singh, arrived in Canada as a refugee in the early 1990s.On Monday, when asked about Ms. Kaur\u2019s work, her mother just smiled. Her father said that he also had no words to describe how proud he and his wife are of their daughter, but he did say: \u201cShe\u2019s following her soul\u2019s purpose.\u201dAfter stumbling upon Ms. Kaur\u2019s work on Tumblr nearly three years ago, Rijoota Gupte, a fan of the writers Jhumpa Lahiri and Khaled Hosseini, couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Ms. Kaur\u2019s words.\u201cRupi\u2019s not like other writers, and that\u2019s exactly why I like her,\u201d she said. Her mother was beside her.\u201cShe\u2019s thought-provoking in a different way, and she opened my eyes to issues not normally talked about in Indian families \u2014 things like abuse, violence towards women, trauma,\u201d Ms. Gupte said. \u201cHer poems are important to South Asian women like me. She\u2019s breaking into this industry that doesn\u2019t represent people who look like her \u2014 who look like me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Frightful Five Want to Rule Entertainment. They Are Hitting Limits.", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that\u2019s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline.Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing \u2014 in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches \u2014 are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit.This is the first of several columns in which I\u2019ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment \u2014 their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked.Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201dThe Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.There\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201dThis story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?It\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It\u2019s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Pixel 2 Smartphone Is a Powerful Extravagance", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last smartphone I reviewed was the original Apple iPhone, which ushered in the mobile revolution back in 2007. At the time, I didn\u2019t exactly give the device a rave. Two weeks after waiting in line for hours outside the San Francisco Apple Store and paying $540 for the iPhone, I even returned it and got my money back.It was obvious to me that the iPhone was a powerful thing and everyone \u2014 from Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, right down to the people I passed on the street \u2014 kept telling me how great it was. But it was also an extravagance. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t really justify its $500-plus cost for another year.Ten years on, I\u2019m now reviewing the Pixel 2, the new flagship phone from Google that goes on sale Thursday. And my take is pretty much the same: People who want the latest and greatest phones won\u2019t be disappointed by the Pixel. But for most of us, this device, with a starting price of $649, is an extravagance.Google has found tremendous success convincing the world that it should prefer smartphones that run Android, its mobile operating system, which dominates global market share over Apple. But Google has had much less success designing and selling its own phones.Now comes the Pixel 2. After testing the gadget for nearly a week, I found I prefer it to the iPhone \u2014 though this is mostly because I have always carried Android phones. Android is what I\u2019m used to, and all my digital data is stored with Google, even though my daughters think I\u2019m silly for not buying an iPhone.Compared with other Android devices, the Pixel 2 XL, the model I tested and the larger of the two versions of the device, was also a big improvement. I own a Samsung Galaxy S7, widely considered the best Android phone on the market a year ago when it went on sale.(Incidentally, she meant it was not just better than my Samsung but also better than her iPhone. And that is not sacrilege. The detail and the colors are far sharper, even to an untrained eye like mine.)The Pixel also charged quickly; a few minutes plugged into the wall gets you hours of battery life. Google said the device is water-resistant. And the screen, 6.2 inches along the diagonal, was enormous \u2014 though not so huge that I couldn\u2019t comfortably hold the phone in one hand. It was nice that, for those rare occasions when I watched extended YouTube videos, the image stretched to the edge of the phone.Yet is any of this all that different from other top-of-the-line phones? Not really. And Google knows this. Even the steep $849 pricing for the Pixel 2 XL was in line with rivals.\u201cIt sounds more normal,\u201d my 13-year-old said. Still, she added that the improvement was small.That sums up all these services. Many are technically impressive, and some are useful. But they took the Pixel only so far past the status quo.Google Lens gave my 9-year-old several minutes of fun over the weekend. But it\u2019s not something she \u2014 or I \u2014 would use on a regular basis. (And it mistook a picture in my bedroom of New York\u2019s Flatiron Building for the Empire State Building.)The Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. My younger daughter loved it. (At one point, she said it was more fun than me.)But like those other assistants, it could not deal with more than just a handful of simple tasks, typically delivering web pages or preset answers in response to questions. When I asked the Assistant whether $824 was expensive for a smartphone, it gave me a YouTube video of a guy unboxing some sort of $20,000 monstrosity.Google boasts that you can instantly switch the Assistant into a mode that lets you type questions rather than ask them orally. But as my wife said, these assistants are useful only because they let you handle basic tasks \u2014 like sending a text or setting an alarm \u2014 without typing. If I wanted to type, I would just visit google.com.Still, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL. On the way to dinner on Saturday night, it correctly identified every song that played on the local 1980s station, from \u201cThe Warrior\u201d to \u201cDer Kommissar.\u201dEven so, I plan to keep the $849 for now. The smaller version of the new Pixel goes for $649, and I might go for that, when I finally need a new phone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Without Harvey Weinstein, Is There a Weinstein Company?", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A bicoastal staff meeting of the Weinstein Company was hastily convened late Thursday. Staff members were scared and shaken after public complaints of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein, the entertainment company\u2019s pugnacious co-founder. With the help of a video conferencing system, David Glasser, the Weinstein Company\u2019s president and chief operating officer, tried to rally the troops.\u201cWe are going to be O.K.,\u201d two people who attended the meeting recalled Mr. Glasser saying. He said his door was open to anyone who wanted to talk and encouraged everyone to stay focused on scheduled films.The movie and television company\u2019s other founder and co-chairman, Bob Weinstein, has a substantial track record running Dimension Films, a label dedicated to horror movies and family fare, like the \u201cSpy Kids\u201d franchise. Mr. Glasser, sometimes referred to in Hollywood as the third Weinstein brother, is an experienced executive. But Harvey Weinstein is the one who called \u2014 or screamed \u2014 the shots, often pushing the company forward by sheer force of will.\u201cWithout Harvey actively managing, the Weinstein Company will become even more capital constrained \u2014 tougher to find funding,\u201d Harold L. Vogel, a media analyst and the author of the book \u201cEntertainment Industry Economics,\u201d wrote in an email on Friday. Even without a crisis, Mr. Vogel noted, the studio\u2019s \u201cbusiness model doesn\u2019t function as well as it once did.\u201dThe Weinstein Company\u2019s board had a heated meeting on Thursday night. On Friday, three members of the board \u2014 Marc Lasry, Dirk Ziff and Tim Sarnoff \u2014 resigned, according to a board member and a company executive. In a statement, Bob Weinstein and three other board members said that a group of lawyers from Debevoise & Plimpton, including one with experience prosecuting sex crimes, would lead an investigation into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s behavior.\u201cAs Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNext steps will depend on Harvey\u2019s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the board\u2019s independent investigation and Harvey\u2019s own personal decisions.\u201dThe Weinstein brothers first came to prominence with Miramax in 1989, the year they helped to activate the indie-film boom with \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape.\u201d They sold Miramax to Disney in 1993 and left in 2005 to form the Weinstein Company. They unsuccessfully dabbled in side businesses, including a fashion label, but eventually found their film footing with releases like \u201cInglourious Basterds.\u201dSo far this year, the Weinstein Company, a boutique studio that specializes in sophisticated, small-budget dramas like the 2011 Oscar winner \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d has released six films, which have taken in a combined $123 million at the domestic box office. (The biggest hit has been \u201cWind River,\u201d a well-reviewed murder mystery that has collected about $33 million.) Last year, the Weinsteins had seven films, with combined ticket sales of just $65 million.To compare, major studios like Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Company generally take in $1 billion to $2.5 billion annually at the domestic box office.The Weinstein Company has also found itself sidelined at film festivals, where Mr. Weinstein has long shopped for movies to release, helping to discover auteurs like Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh. For years at the Sundance Film Festival, for instance, his wallet was the only one that mattered to agents, who would track his team relentlessly. Netflix and Amazon dominate now.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in his more recent diminished state, he remained a player, prodding a tiny, largely subtitled art film, \u201cLion,\u201d to six nominations this year. (The last time a Weinstein film was a force at the Oscars was in 2012, when \u201cThe Artist\u201d collected five awards, including best picture.)In this year\u2019s Oscars cycle, the company\u2019s big hopes are \u201cWind River\u201d and \u201cThe Current War,\u201d a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that is scheduled for a late November release. It received a tepid response at last month\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival, but Mr. Weinstein has personally helped to re-edit the movie since then.Several agents and producers said that, without Mr. Weinstein\u2019s all-or-nothing campaigning style, those films would probably be stranded on the awards trail.As the movie business has become more difficult, the Weinsteins have found success in television, especially the reality genre, with Heidi Klum\u2019s \u201cProject Runway.\u201d That series runs on Lifetime, a division of A&E Networks, and has spawned several spinoffs.Amazon, Showtime, A&E and Paramount all declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein on Friday or did not respond to queries. Ms. Klum, Mr. Sheridan and other people involved with Weinstein Company films and shows responded similarly.One prominent agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to draw his company into the controversy, said that he would advise female clients against withdrawing from Weinstein projects. He quickly added, however, that he would also tell them to ask for a contract saying that they would have zero contact with Harvey Weinstein.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Many People Watch Netflix? Nielsen Tries to Solve a Mystery", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the five years since Netflix started streaming original series like the Emmy-winning \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cMaster of None,\u201d the shows have had a question hanging over them: How many people are watching?Outside of Netflix, nobody knows the answer.That\u2019s because, much to the frustration of those in the industry who would like to have a firm idea of just how popular those shows are, the streaming services \u2014 Amazon and Hulu included \u2014 have been fiercely protective of their numbers.Now, Nielsen, the 94-year-old company that for decades has had an effective monopoly on measuring television ratings in the United States, has announced that it has found a way into the great unknown of Netflix viewership.What Nielsen\u2019s data shows, exactly, and how rigorously it is measured remains something of a mystery, because Nielsen did not release the data publicly. The move, however, is a step toward finding a reliable third-party ratings system for streaming services.\u201cThe important part of this is it provides transparency for an environment that has been pretty much a blind spot for the studios and broadcasters,\u201d said Megan Clarken, the president of Nielsen\u2019s so-called Watch division.Nielsen announced the initiative on Wednesday morning, but it has been collecting Netflix viewership data over the last two months in a kind of test run.The company said it was able to determine how many viewers were streaming Netflix content through audio recognition software in the 44,000 Nielsen-rated homes across the United States.Nielsen has been releasing its Netflix data privately to media companies that have subscribed to the service, including the Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros., Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and A&E Networks.Nielsen executives said that those companies would now have the ability to access viewership figures for shows they licensed to Netflix, like \u201cFriends\u201d from Warner Bros., as well as originals like \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201dNielsen executives said the company had not yet begun collecting data from other streaming services like Hulu or Amazon.And there are likely to be questions concerning Nielsen\u2019s accuracy. Though the ratings are drawn from its much-ballyhooed television panel, the numbers include only viewers who are using a television set. If someone watches a Netflix show on a laptop, tablet or smartphone, it is not included in the count.Additionally, Nielsen\u2019s data comes only from customers in the United States, and Netflix has made an aggressive play in international markets. Of its roughly 104 million paying subscribers, a little more than half live outside the United States, according to Netflix\u2019s third-quarter earnings.Nielsen said its numbers would be more reliable.\u201cIt\u2019s far, far superior,\u201d Ms. Clarken said. \u201cSymphony was a small panel. It wasn\u2019t recruited in any kind of capacity to the gold standard that we recruit, so there\u2019s no representation in there. And it was very small.\u201d\u201cIt provided interesting analytics,\u201d she continued. \u201cOur goal is to go well beyond interesting analytics. This is about providing a ratings equivalent to a high-quality ratings service.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Company Scrambles as Weinstein Takes Leave and a Third of the Board Resigns", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Weinstein had said on Thursday that he would take a leave of absence, but it was unclear when he would leave, how long he would be gone, or what it meant for his relationship with the company he co-founded.\u201cAs Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,\u201d said a statement signed by four board members, Bob Weinstein, Tarak Ben Ammar, Lance Maerov and Richard Koenigsberg. \u201cNext steps will depend on Harvey\u2019s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board\u2019s independent investigation, and Harvey\u2019s own personal decisions.\u201dThe moves came as employees and business partners of the company voiced concern about the allegations, revealed in a New York Times investigation on Thursday, and board members and executives jostled for control.Harvey Weinstein did not sign the statement put out by the four board members, and did not respond to requests for comment. With him gone, the statement said, his brother, Bob Weinstein, the company\u2019s co-chairman, and David Glasser, the president and chief operating officer, are in charge of the company.Meanwhile, three members of the board \u2014 Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor; Marc Lasry, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and chief executive of Avenue Capital Group, an investment firm; and Tim Sarnoff, president of production services and deputy chief executive of Technicolor \u2014 have resigned, according to a board member and a company executive. The status of the ninth board member, Paul Tudor Jones, is unclear. He did not sign the statement or respond to a request for comment.The Times investigation found complaints of sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein stretching back decades and at least eight settlements paid to women. Angered by the revelations, employees of the company have demanded swift action by its leaders.Earlier Friday, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein said in a television appearance that he had acted inappropriately and agreed with an interviewer who had characterized Mr. Weinstein\u2019s reported actions as illegal.The acknowledgment by the lawyer, Lisa Bloom, came during an interview with George Stephanopoulos on the ABC News program \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in which he asked her about the report.\u201cThis is a real pattern over 30 years; this is like textbook sexual harassment,\u201d Mr. Stephanopoulos said, after describing the allegations.\u201cIt\u2019s gross, yeah,\u201d Ms. Bloom replied.\u201cIt\u2019s illegal,\u201d Mr. Stephanopoulos said.\u201cYes. You know, I agree,\u201d Ms. Bloom said. \u201cSee, you have to understand that, yes, I\u2019m here as his adviser. I\u2019m not defending him in any sexual harassment cases \u2014 there aren\u2019t any sexual harassment cases. I\u2019m working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, \u2018I have caused a lot of pain.\u2019\u201dReached by The Times for additional comment on Friday, Ms. Bloom said: \u201cThe New York Times allegations if true would constitute sexual harassment. However, Mr. Weinstein denies many of them and was not given a fair opportunity to present evidence and witnesses on his side.\u201dDanielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said that Mr. Weinstein had been given two days to respond.\u201cWe included all relevant comments from Mr. Weinstein in our story and published his entire response,\u201d she said. \u201cMr. Weinstein and his lawyer have confirmed the essential points of the story. They have not pointed to any errors or challenged any facts in our story.\u201dMs. Rhoades Ha also called for Mr. Weinstein to release his employees from nondisclosure agreements he reportedly had them sign.\u201cAs a supporter of women, he must support their right to speak openly about these issues of gender and power,\u201d she said.Weinstein Company board members spent nearly three hours Thursday night locked on the phone in heated discussion about the best way to respond. Mr. Weinstein co-founded the company with his brother, Bob Weinstein, and they own 42 percent of it.Everyone agreed that an outside investigation was necessary, but there had been debate over the length and terms of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s leave, and whether additional steps were necessary, according to those involved.In an email to employees on Friday, Mr. Glasser, the company\u2019s president, said that the company was \u201ctaking the allegations seriously\u201d and that the investigation would determine the \u201cbest decision for how to address the situation.\u201dHe said the company would start working with an \u201cindependent, third party firm\u201d to which employees could report episodes of harassment they had experienced or witnessed. He said that the company \u201cvalues women\u201d and was \u201ccommitted to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.\u201d\u201cI truly want to do what is right for this company, our many wonderful partners and, most importantly, you \u2014 our employees, so we are not taking this lightly,\u201d Mr. Glasser wrote.In its statement on Friday night, the board said, \u201cWe believe it is important to learn the full truth regarding the article\u2019s very serious accusations, in the interests of the Company, its shareholders and its employees.\u201dThe departure of Mr. Weinstein is a serious blow for his company, which was already struggling at the box office. The independent studio is currently headed into a make-or-break period \u2014 Oscar season \u2014 without its master campaigner. In recent weeks, Mr. Weinstein had been personally working to re-edit \u201cThe Current War,\u201d a drama set for release in late November and intended as an anchor of the company\u2019s awards slate.As it has become harder to make money with prestige-minded dramas, many of which now find their primary audiences through video on demand, the Weinstein Company has tried to pivot toward television production. But Mr. Weinstein\u2019s leave \u2014 not to mention an internal investigation and a board in disarray \u2014 may also curb those efforts, which include two major series in the works for Amazon Studios and three planned for Viacom\u2019s new Paramount channel.But several actors, producers and directors contacted on Friday declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein and the relatively minimal public conversation in Hollywood about his behavior. One who did speak, Lynda Obst, a producer of films including \u201cInterstellar,\u201d \u201cSleepless in Seattle,\u201d and \u201cThe Fisher King,\u201d said she expected more reactions to eventually surface.\u201cI think everyone is just taking it in, it\u2019s so upsetting \u2014 talking internally,\u201d Ms. Obst said. \u201cI do expect a robust response from the community rejecting this kind of behavior toward women. Obviously it is intolerable.\u201dThe New York Times received the following statement from Harvey Weinstein responding to allegations about his treatment of women in Hollywood.\u201cNauseating, chicken-hearted enablers all,\u201d he called them.The actress Kirstie Alley retweeted a message posted by the actor Peter Fonda in which Mr. Fonda said he would have insulted Mr. Weinstein to his face had he known about the alleged abuse.Mr. Weinstein had supported endowments honoring women at both Rutgers University and the University of Southern California.Rutgers said Friday that it planned to keep his financial contribution to the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture, and Feminist Studies, adding in a statement that the university \u201ccan think of no better use of this donation than to continue this important work.\u201dU.S.C. did not say whether the news would affect an endowment for female filmmakers that Mr. Weinstein had pledged to organize.In the interview on Friday, Ms. Bloom said that she took issue with characterizations of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s actions as harassment.\u201cYou\u2019re using the term sexual harassment, which is a legal term,\u201d she told Mr. Stephanopoulos. \u201cSo, I\u2019m using the term workplace misconduct. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a real significant difference to most people, but sexual harassment is severe and pervasive.\u201d\u201cWhat Harvey Weinstein has done is wrong; he has caused pain,\u201d Ms. Bloom said, adding: \u201cHere was an opportunity of a guy saying, \u2018Lisa, what should I do? I have behaved badly.\u2019 I\u2019m like, good, I\u2019ll tell you what to do. Be honest, be real.\u201d\u201cHad I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cI only represent those who allege that they are victims of sexual harassment.\u201dReporting was contributed by Brooks Barnes, Dave Itzkoff, Matt Stevens and Melena Ryzik.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Women Behind \u2018Good Girls Revolt\u2019 Think the Time Is Right to Revive the Feminist Show", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA scene from the pilot episode of \u201cGood Girls Revolt.\u201dAmazon Studios declined to order another season of the feminist series \u201cGood Girls Revolt\u201d last year, just as the show\u2019s relevance was on the rise.The series, set in 1969 and \u201970, told the story of a fictional magazine, \u201cNews of the Week,\u201d where women were harassed and barred from being reporters. In Episode 10, the women filed a lawsuit seeking equal treatment. That was the finale of the first season, and the show was not picked up for a second.That might have been the end of it \u2014 just another show, cut short at a cliffhanger, good while it lasted.Now, fans of the series are wondering whether it might have survived under different leadership.Dana Calvo, the show\u2019s creator and executive producer, said in a phone interview that when she went to pitch a second season of \u201cGood Girls Revolt\u201d to Mr. Price on Nov. 30, 2016, she learned that he had never watched the first. \u201cHe confirmed that by having us refer to the characters by the actresses\u2019 names,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was unfamiliar.\u201dStill, she was surprised to learn \u2014 the very next day \u2014 that it would not be picked up for a second season. \u201cIt didn\u2019t line up. It was confusing. It just didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said.The actor Joy Bryant played Eleanor Holmes Norton in the series, a character named for the real-life lawyer who represented the women suing Newsweek.\u201cAll the actors who worked on the show understood the importance of what we were doing, and how we really needed to honor the story and honor these women,\u201d Ms. Bryant said in a phone interview.She spent time getting to know Ms. Norton, who became the first woman to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1977 and is now the District of Columbia\u2019s delegate to the United States House of Representatives.Ms. Bryant said she was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the show was not picked up for a second season, and the drama was heightened by real-world events. Season 1 began streaming on Amazon in late October, just before Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.\u201cI know we\u2019re talking about TV, but it was sort of a microcosm of what was going on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought we had it in the bag. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to win. There\u2019s no way we\u2019re getting canceled.\u201d\u201cThat happened, and that happened, and it was like \u2026 we\u2019re really operating against some crazy forces right now,\u201d she said.Anna Camp, who played the strait-laced magazine researcher Jane Hollander, said she was \u201cshocked\u201d when the series was not renewed.Then she heard about Mr. Price\u2019s resignation. \u201cIt was just so meta, or twisted, when we found out Roy Price had been accused of sexual harassment,\u201d she added. \u201cSo many frustrated fans were reaching out and saying, \u2018Now that he\u2019s gone, maybe the show could come back.\u2019 \u201dMs. Povich said the outcry reminded her that \u201cthere is power in numbers,\u201d a lesson she learned at Newsweek during the 1960s and 1970s.\u201cIt was a complicated time,\u201d Ms. Povich said, adding that the newsmagazine resisted hiring permanent female writers even after the 1970 complaint. A second lawsuit in 1972 laid out more concrete goals and seemed to achieve better results, including Ms. Povich\u2019s appointment to a senior editor position in 1975.Ms. Povich worked with Ms. Calvo to shape the show and said she was sorry to see it end. \u201cI cannot tell you how many young women I heard from who loved the series, and who also had no idea what my generation or their mothers\u2019 generation or their grandmothers\u2019 generation went through,\u201d she said.Amazon Studios, the company\u2019s original programming division, does not release viewership data. \u201cWe had high hopes for Good Girls Revolt when it was green-lighted, but it had a low season completion rate, and did not perform well on the service,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.A spokesman would not speculate on whether the company might consider signing on for a second season, and declined to confirm who made the decision not to renew in 2016.Ms. Povich said that in light of the harassment allegations against Mr. Price, Amazon should look at the series again \u201cwith a much more objective point of view.\u201dMs. Camp agreed. \u201cTo have our voices taken away from us so abruptly, and to have it all unfold the way it has, has been incredibly frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cI miss Jane, and I really want to play her again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wines Are No Longer Free to Travel Across State Lines", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThose days are no more. In the last year or so, carriers like United Parcel Service and FedEx have told retailers that they will no longer accept out-of-state shipments of alcoholic beverages unless they are bound for one of 14 states (along with Washington, D.C.) that explicitly permit such interstate commerce.New York is not one of those 14 states, as The New York Times\u2019s wine panel learned to its chagrin in the last year.All of the bottles we sample at our wine tastings are purchased retail. When Bernard Kirsch, our tasting coordinator, could not find the wines he wanted in New York, he ordered from elsewhere, doing regular business with retailers in California and New Jersey, among other places. I, too, like many wine lovers, occasionally bought wine from out-of-state shops for my personal consumption. But that has ended.Strictly speaking, it was probably never entirely legal in New York or in many other states to have wine shipped in from out-of-state retailers. Yet, these laws requiring a license for interstate wine shipments seemed vague and were rarely enforced.But now, states \u2014 urged on by wine and spirits wholesalers who oppose any sort of interstate alcohol commerce that bypasses them \u2014 have stepped up enforcement efforts. Retailers say that the carriers began sending out letters to them a year ago saying they would no longer handle their shipments.Before the internet, the bigger wine shops sometimes printed periodic catalogs for their customers, particularly around the holidays. If those catalogs found their way into hands in other states and enticed a few far-flung sales, it was no big deal one way or the other.Broadband changed everything. No longer did retailers have to identify and attract potential customers. With a few clicks of the mouse, eager consumers could seek out wine shops all over the country, scour their inventories and order the bottles they wanted.Like other retailers I spoke with, Mr. Wolff was not willing to offer precise sales figures, but he said a significant amount of Chambers Street\u2019s business had been from out of state.\u201cIt seems a shame to tell consumers anywhere that they can\u2019t freely purchase something they want,\u201d he said.Though the ruling applied to wineries, not to retailers, Granholm had a liberating effect on consumers who suddenly found it much easier to find the wines they wanted online. The decision also allows the direct shipment of wines purchased by tourists at wineries to all states.\u201cAs in anything in business, this is pure greed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very few industries that are so regulated. We have an authority that looks over us, that makes sure we pay our bills on time. We have a very rigid system in place, state by state. These wholesalers, they hold all the cards.\u201dThe wholesalers, for their part, insist that their interest is solely to protect consumers from fraud, threats to health and underage drinking.\u201cNew York can\u2019t hold Nevada accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cMultiply that out by tens of thousands. There\u2019s no jurisdiction for retailers at the federal level.\u201d\u201cWith everybody licensed, the supply chain is guaranteed top to bottom,\u201d he said.Wholesalers have argued for years that such tight regulation, which happens to be to their commercial advantage, is all that protects the wine and spirits business from descending into chaos. The Supreme Court did not buy the argument in 2005, and to me, their economic interest seems a far more likely motivation than public health.\u201cWe\u2019ve felt the pinch of states closing down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to look for other ways to replace that business.\u201dAt the same time, retailers are lobbying for bills that would loosen restrictions on web purchases. A bill in New York that would permit out-of-state retailers to ship to New York died in committee last year, Mr. Posner said. He is hoping the bill will be reintroduced in January.\u201cThe internet has allowed many industries to go forward, but this is sending us backward,\u201d he said.Independent retailers also face the threat of consolidation. Costco is now the biggest wine retailer in the country, and Amazon is now getting into selling wine, a move that has been given brick-and-mortar significance by its recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which has many outlets with retail wine licenses.This does not affect New York retailers so much as New York law restricts retailers to one license, and therefore one store, in the state. But around the country it means fewer choices for consumers. Curtailing out-of-state shipping only makes it worse.In an age where you can order just about anything on the internet, including wine, consumers deserve safe access to great retailers over state borders.AlaskaCaliforniaIdahoLouisianaMissouriNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew MexicoNorth DakotaOregonVirginiaWashington, D.C.West VirginiaWyomingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Halperin\u2019s \u2018Game Change\u2019 Partner Says He Was Unaware", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the political journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, work on the third installment of their popular \u201cGame Change\u201d book series \u2014 set to be an insiders\u2019 account of the final two months of the 2016 presidential race \u2014 came to an abrupt halt last Wednesday at around 10 a.m.That was when Mr. Heilemann received a call from a shaken Mr. Halperin, who informed his longtime partner in writing and reporting that CNN was about to publish a potentially damaging story. Several of Mr. Halperin\u2019s former colleagues at ABC News had accused him of sexual harassment and sexual assault.It was a short conversation. Before it was over, Mr. Halperin said he was sorry.\u201cI had never heard of, been exposed to or had any inkling of the notion that he had engaged in any behavior that could be described in even the broadest sense of being sexual harassment or sexual assault,\u201d Mr. Heilemann said, in his first public remarks since the claims against Mr. Halperin surfaced.He added, \u201cI was flabbergasted and shocked.\u201dThe two men were among the most successful and well-compensated teams in journalism. Their nine-year partnership generated an Emmy Award-winning HBO film, a pair of lucrative television franchises and best-selling books that defined a now-common kind of gossipy political reporting.The partnership is now over.Hours after CNN\u2019s report about Mr. Halperin, Penguin Press killed the pair\u2019s coming book, and HBO pulled out of a planned mini-series based on it. Showtime, which airs their political documentary series, \u201cThe Circus,\u201d said Mr. Halperin would not return.In the interview, Mr. Heilemann said he was still coming to terms with the accusations that have been lodged against his longtime collaborator. Mr. Halperin \u2014 who has denied allegations of groping and assault, but acknowledged pursuing relationships with ABC colleagues \u2014 worked at ABC until 2007, roughly a year before he teamed up with Mr. Heilemann for \u201cGame Change\u201d during the 2008 presidential campaign.\u201cThe bare nature of the accusations are horrific and shocking and terrible,\u201d Mr. Heilemann said. \u201cThese behaviors are not the behaviors that I witnessed, and they\u2019re not consistent with the person that I thought I knew. That\u2019s not an excuse. That\u2019s just the truth.\u201dMr. Halperin declined to comment for this article. The allegations against him, which have expanded in recent days as more women have come forward, place him in a group of media figures felled by claims of sexual misconduct in the wake of numerous allegations against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein.It remains unclear what will become of Mr. Halperin\u2019s contributions to the scuttled third installment in the \u201cGame Change\u201d series. The pair had conducted roughly 300 interviews for the book in recent months, Mr. Heilemann said.\u201cWe\u2019ve done reporting that touches on important things both for history and for the current national dialogue,\u201d he said.The two achieved riches and prominence that most reporters only dream about. They moved through the crowds at rallies lit up by their own dedicated Showtime camera crew. Their employer, Bloomberg News, installed a huge promotional poster for their show featuring their images on the side of the Marriott in Des Moines, a popular hangout for campaign reporters.\u201cGame Change,\u201d a No. 1 best-seller, sold nearly half a million copies; its HBO film adaptation won Emmys and Golden Globes. They wrote a sequel, \u201cDouble Down: Game Change 2012,\u201d and appeared frequently on cable news; Bloomberg was said to be paying Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann salaries in the range of $1 million.Mr. Heilemann, who made his reputation at Wired, The New Yorker and New York magazine, dreamed up the idea for \u201cGame Change\u201d \u2014 a Hollywood-style account of a presidential election \u2014 while vacationing in Aspen, Colo. He pitched the idea to Mr. Halperin, an acquaintance from the campaign trail, during a ride to a John McCain rally in 2008.\u201cMark was my friend,\u201d Mr. Heilemann said. \u201cI cared about him then, and I care about him now. It\u2019s also the case that Mark wasn\u2019t in the circle of my closest friends.\u201dMany of their interviews were conducted jointly. Asked if he could use that material for a prospective solo project, Mr. Heilemann replied: \u201cT.B.D. It\u2019s complicated.\u201dShowtime said that the network remained on good terms with Mr. Heilemann and that it was examining whether \u201cThe Circus\u201d will go on without Mr. Halperin. NBC News, where Mr. Heilemann is a contributor, has severed ties with Mr. Halperin.The men worked closely for nearly a decade, including a two-year stretch of near-daily contact for their Bloomberg TV show. What would Mr. Heilemann say to a skeptic who found it difficult to believe that he had been unaware of Mr. Halperin\u2019s alleged misbehavior?\u201cI would never try to argue anybody out of their skepticism about anything,\u201d Mr. Heilemann said. \u201cAll I can say is, I barely knew Mark in the period of time when he stands accused of doing these things. People are entitled to their opinions about what I should have known, or must have known, or whatever. But the timeline is what the timeline is.\u201dHe added: \u201cI hope that my reputation has not been damaged by this. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m crumpled in the corner in some way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re following how the health care industry plans to fight back against President Trump\u2019s move to undercut the Affordable Care Act. More on that in a moment.This morning, we\u2019re announcing the speaker lineup for our sixth annual conference.Andrew will host a series of conversations throughout the day with some of the biggest newsmakers at the intersection of business and policy.Among them:A rare public interview with one of the most influential women in the worlds of business and philanthropy, whose organization invests in businesses like The Atlantic and the Washington Wizards and in causes like immigration and education.Also: Will the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback be able to prove that the N.F.L.\u2019s owners have banded together to prevent him from playing?From the filing:Respondents N.F.L. and N.F.L.

Under the [collective bargaining agreement], the mere fact that a player is unsigned does not constitute evidence of collusion.Why this matters\u2022 Mr. Kapernick\u2019s protest during the national anthem set off President Trump\u2019s attacks against the league, pitting players against owners and drawing sponsors into the fray.\u2022 If N.F.L. owners had hoped for a swift end to the controversy, they\u2019re probably disappointed.The answer:And Steve Bannon went on record to say that the White House move was meant to destroy the Obama health care plan.Bannon said Trump\u2019s decision to not continue funding Obamacare subsidies, announced Thursday, was designed to \u201cblow up\u201d the health care law and insurance marketplaces.\u201cGonna blow those exchanges up, right?\u201d Bannon said.Terminating this critical program will do just the opposite. This action will make it harder for patients to access the care they need. Costs will go up and choices will be restricted.The insurers may have backing from Republican politicians who protested the move.But the biggest opposition may come from some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own base.The bottom lineWill a coalition of insurers, politicians and voters overturn what Mr. Trump has started?\u2022 The Senate is scheduled to vote tomorrow on starting debate on the 2018 fiscal year budget.What happens when perhaps the most hotly anticipated initial public offering doesn\u2019t take place?Reports now say that Aramco probably would list on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul exchange next year.

{"Headline": "Revisiting the Classics of Milan Shopping", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal ShoppingMILAN \u2014 The fashion designer Massimo Alba is correct in calling his city a place \u201cfull of hidden surprises you can only discover if you know it well,\u201d because Milan\u2019s charms reveal themselves discreetly. Its choicest offerings are often hidden in plain sight. Take the specialty store on busy Corso Magenta, which I had passed for years without entering, until this summer a Milanese friend suggested stopping at E. E. Ercolessi for a pen.The pen was for her 12-year-old daughter, and as startling as it was to think of an adolescent\u2019s employing analog technology was the fact that she uses a fountain pen. Less surprising, perhaps, was the existence in Milan of not one specialty store devoted to writing instruments but three. My favorite is the one we visited, established by Edgardo Ercolessi in 1921, and still family owned.Counters run along three sides of the small shop, with wood cabinets behind them displaying much of the stock. Though catalogs are available to help those with limited Italian, the professional staff is also eager to offer assistance, bringing up from the basement on a stock elevator classic offerings from manufacturers like Pelikan and Graf von Faber-Castell or the more plebeian Lamy we\u2019d come to find.In general, Milanese shopkeepers retain an old-fashioned approach to customer service, treating each decision of taste as essentially collaborative. Thus when you walk into Mr. Alba\u2019s handsomely appointed shop on Via Brera, just 10 minutes on foot from La Scala, you immediately get a buzzy sense that some perfect article of clothing is waiting just for you.If at Massimo Alba the classics are revisited regularly with subtle alterations of color and details, at AD56, my favorite haberdashery in the city, the stock is never the same from one season to the next.Soon after my initial visit, I began placing regular orders for custom-made button-down cotton Oxfords tailored to my measurements, a bargain at 120 euros apiece (about $140). What draws me back to this shop and showroom, though, is its ever-changing assortment of ties, scarves, shawls and pocket squares, all milled especially for them.A city consecrated to maintaining tradition, Milan is a paradise for those who prize specialization and anachronism \u2014 fuddy-duddy heaven. Where else, for instance, will you find 10 different bakeries competing to make the best pan dei morti, bread baked exclusively for All Souls\u2019 Day?Though it is hard to gauge how much use anyone truly has for hand-forged nutcrackers, they are among the items stocked by G. Lorenzi, a storied accessories and cutlery shop saved from extinction after the doors of its central Milan store closed in 2014.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford for it to disappear,\u201d said Guglielmo Miani, president of the Montenapoleone Association and head of the family tailoring boutique Larusmiani, who courted Lorenzi\u2019s longtime owner, 81-year-old Aldo Lorenzi, for months before persuading him to install an outpost of a landmark first opened in the 1920s in his own store.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reeling From Scandal, Weinstein Company Gets a Financial Lifeline", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The embattled Weinstein Company on Monday secured a financial lifeline \u2014 and possible new owner \u2014 from an investor with experience in distressed Hollywood assets. But the fate of the studio, including whether its co-founder Bob Weinstein would stay involved, remained far from resolved.Tarak Ben Ammar, one of three remaining Weinstein Company board members, said in a statement on Monday that the studio, reeling from sexual harassment allegations made against the company\u2019s other co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, had reached a preliminary agreement with Colony Capital for an \u201cimmediate\u201d cash infusion. The amount was undisclosed.Mr. Ammar also said that Colony, which rescued Michael Jackson\u2019s Neverland Ranch from foreclosure in 2008, had entered negotiations to buy all or most of the Weinstein Company\u2019s movie and television holdings. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., founder of Colony Capital, said in a statement that he believed the sullied studio \u201chas substantial value and growth potential.\u201d A deal is expected to take three weeks or more to complete.Not mentioned by the Weinstein Company on Monday: Bob Weinstein, who insisted on Friday that speculation about a sale was \u201cuntrue.\u201d Harvey Weinstein was fired by the company last week.Bob Weinstein is fighting to remain at the studio, but some stakeholders believe he must leave, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Bob Weinstein, who told The Hollywood Reporter on Saturday that he did not know \u201cthe extent\u201d of his brother\u2019s actions, did not respond to a request for comment.In turning to Colony, the Weinstein Company and its advisers at the investment bank Moelis & Company are reaching out to a firm with experience in Hollywood. But some longtime media investors, noting the seriousness of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, questioned what could be done with such a toxic asset.Four board members have resigned in recent days, leaving only Mr. Ammar, Bob Weinstein and Lance Maerov.As a private company \u2014 the brothers each own about 23 percent \u2014 the Weinstein Company has never been particularly forthcoming about its revenue or debt load. In recent years, as talk of unpaid bills and an inability to finance marketing campaigns has occasionally surfaced, the Weinsteins insisted their company was, in fact, rolling in money.But certain financial problems surfaced that Harvey Weinstein was unable to refute. Facing bankruptcy in 2010, for instance, the Weinstein Company sold rights to 200 older films to Goldman Sachs and an insurance company, Assured Guaranty. The exact titles that were sold are not publicly known. Goldman, in turn, sold its portion to AMC Networks in 2015.The Weinstein Company now has assets that fall into three groups: the remaining library of old movies, upcoming films and television. All three are problematic.Given the 2010 sale, much of the value of the library has \u201calready been extracted,\u201d Mr. Malin said.The Weinstein Company has seven completed movies, but some of those are art films with limited box office potential, especially without Harvey Weinstein\u2019s hard-knuckled efforts to strengthen audience interest through awards campaigns. Others are potentially tainted by the scandal that has settled over the studio.One movie on the Weinstein Company\u2019s release schedule is \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d for instance. The first \u201cPaddington\u201d took in a solid $76.3 million in North America in 2015. But marketing a family movie is going to be hard for a company associated with harassment allegations.Anchored by \u201cProject Runway,\u201d the Weinstein Company\u2019s television unit has been a bright spot recently. Upcoming series include three projects for the Paramount Network, the Viacom-owned channel formerly known as Spike. (A Paramount spokesman confirmed on Monday that those were moving forward.) But other television projects have died over the last week as networks have scrambled to sever ties with the studio.\u201cThe question is whether the television division is a going concern or a liquidation,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cSome will argue that the major asset of the television division was Harvey Weinstein\u2019s ability to be a rainmaker \u2014 to line up deals.\u201dColony Capital is the private equity arm of Colony NorthStar, an investment firm that controls $56 billion in assets. Mr. Barrack, its chairman, has gained attention recently for his longtime friendship with President Trump. Mr. Barrack was a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and served as chairman of his inaugural committee.Mr. Barrack, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants who owned a grocery store in the suburbs of Los Angeles, made his money by betting on out-of-favor assets. In the 1990s, Colony Capital bought bad loans during the savings-and-loan crisis and bet on Asian assets after the Asian currency crisis. The same strategy was used following the 2008 financial crisis. Colony Capital acquired billions of dollars of distressed commercial and residential property mortgages and loans that had been seized from failed banks by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.But Colony has also made a number of investments in distressed entertainment assets.In the spring of 2008, Colony bailed out Michael Jackson, who was on the verge of default over a $24.5 million mortgage for Neverland Ranch, his 2,500-acre playground in Santa Ynez, Calif. When Jackson died in 2009, the ranch wound up in Colony\u2019s hands. Renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch, the property was relisted this year for $67 million. That\u2019s down from the $100 million original listing price two years ago.In 2010, Colony acquired the debt of the celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz after she was unable to make payments on a $24 million loan. Brooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles and Julie Creswell from New York. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London and Rachel Abrams contributed from New York.Advertisement"}

And knowing references are rife, including to Trumps, Kardashians and Murdochs.That the White House currently contains a real-estate tycoon\u2014 familiar from the \u201980s, yet \u2014 and his scions makes \u201cDynasty\u201d seem particularly resonant, though of course tangling bloodlines are a dramatic device as old as the ancient Greeks. \u201cFrom the Clintons to the Kennedys, this isn\u2019t a new thing, our fascination with these really powerful families,\u201d said Nathalie Kelley, who plays Cristal. \u201cBut one thing we\u2019ve talked about which is interesting is patriarchy \u2014 how much it has shifted, and how much it\u2019s stayed the same.\u201dThe former Krystle (Linda Evans) had been Blake\u2019s secretary, positioned in perpetual saintly opposition to the devious Alexis and meekly tiptoeing around the Carrington mansion like the nameless heroine of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s \u201cRebecca.\u201d\u201cIn the original Blake is shutting the door in her face because she has to have a meeting and she\u2019s trying to get a word in about the china or something,\u201d Ms. Kelley said. \u201cShe\u2019s not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house.\u201dThis Cristal begins in public relations and goes on to contest fiercely with Fallon to become chief operating officer of the Carrington energy company.She is also young enough to be his daughter, though Ms. Kelley argued that at 33 she is past an age that could provoke eye rolls. \u201cWhen I first met with Josh and Stephanie, I was like, \u2018I think Cristal needs to be at least in her 30s,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone who\u2019s under 30, and that threshold makes a big difference.\u201dAs Mr. Show put it: \u201cPeople are younger today. The whole show\u2019s younger.\u201dShe is also entwined enough with Blake that some early viewers have suggested her character resembles Ivanka Trump, and for them Ms. Gillies has developed a one-line rejoinder: \u201cI have better shoes,\u201d she said, striding away in a pair of Christian Louboutin heels.Neither iteration of \u201cDynasty\u201d can be separated from its devotion to materialism and the one percent. \u201cI just have memories of how white the rooms were, the carpet \u2014 that\u2019s what the rich have,\u201d said Ms. Patrick, the showrunner, who grew up in Atlanta.But the very rich are not only different from you and me, but from how they used to be. The 2017 Colbys made their money in tech, the Carrington children are concerned about the environment and everyone accepts differences in race and sexual orientation unblinkingly. The once dithering Steven is now \u201cgay and proud,\u201d Ms. Patrick said. \u201cThat\u2019s not his issue with his father; it\u2019s that he\u2019s a liberal.\u201dMr. Show said he thought \u201cthis Blake has a lot more pathology\u201d than his predecessor. Crew members were hammering behind him at the opulent set, with its staircase built for flouncing down O\u2018Hara-style, and twinkling chandeliers.\u201cHe tells untruths when he doesn\u2019t need to and I don\u2019t know why yet, I\u2019m developing the character,\u201d Mr. Show said. \u201cI\u2019m taking that as seriously as I possibly can, and then it cuts to a catfight.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cisco and Google Find Mutual Interest in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google and Cisco Systems, two trendsetters in different eras of the internet, are joining forces as the growth of cloud computing puts new pressure on big tech companies and leads to strange corporate bedfellows.The Silicon Valley giants on Wednesday announced a collaboration to help companies manage software and technology services that may run in their own data centers or in facilities operated by external cloud services.Google, the largest unit of its parent, Alphabet, hopes to benefit from Cisco\u2019s close ties to corporate customers as the search engine giant tries to catch up to Amazon, the market leader in cloud services, and Microsoft.Cisco could also use some help. The tech giant, which in 2000 briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company when its computer networking equipment was used to build the internet, faces a serious threat from cloud services. Companies that once spent heavily on new hardware from Cisco and other suppliers increasingly rent cloud services instead, with companies like Amazon doing most of the heavy lifting in the background.\u201cEvery company that built an empire on selling equipment to companies to put in their data centers is feeling incredible pressure,\u201d said Dave Bartoletti, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, a market research firm.Cisco has also faced stiffening competition from rivals like the software maker VMware, which announced a partnership with Amazon last year.Cisco and Google executives vowed to offer something different. They said companies have been struggling with the fact that they need separate tools to manage software on their own premises and those running in the cloud, a situation that sometimes causes security problems. By combining Google programming technology and Cisco networking and security software, they said, tech managers can create and manage software that can run securely in or outside their companies\u2019 data centers.The idea, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google\u2019s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, is to close those \u201csecurity gaps.\u201dGoogle has moved aggressively to catch up. In late 2015, the company gave the job of running its cloud business to Diane Greene, a widely respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped make VMware\u2019s technology a mainstay at many corporations.She made a series of organizational changes, recruited new talent and introduced new technology features. In one important move, Google in September 2016 bought the start-up Apigee Corporation for $625 million, adding capabilities to help customers connect their operations with online services operated by others.So has Cisco. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., promoted a concept called \u201cintercloud\u201d that amounted to coordinating a federation of cloud services operated by partners.But Cisco dropped that approach last year, choosing instead to help customers manage \u201chybrid\u201d cloud arrangements \u2014 industry parlance for using a blend of operations in a company\u2019s own data centers and those operated by a growing number of cloud services.\u201cWe think we are one of the few companies that can navigate this multi-cloud world,\u201d said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Cisco\u2019s networking and security business.The company has broadly signaled plans to rely more on software and services than on sales of networking hardware, aided frequently by acquisitions. On Monday, for example, Cisco said it would pay $1.9 billion for BroadSoft, which sells online communications services.Other companies also have embraced the hybrid cloud concept. Microsoft, for example, has longtime ties with corporate software buyers and has come up with ways to run new cloud applications in its data centers or on customers\u2019 premises, said Al Gillen, an analyst at the research firm IDC.\u201cWe see other vendors doing things to compete since what we have is so strong and so unique,\u201d said Julia White, a corporate vice president with Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business.VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, was first known for software technology called virtualization that allows more efficient use of servers but now competes with Cisco with networking software. Russ Currie, a vice president of enterprise strategy at the network monitoring specialist NetScout Systems, said VMware was effectively using its cloud alliance with A.W.S. to court customers. Pat Gelsinger, VMware\u2019s chief executive, called the announcement from Google and Cisco a \u201cvalidation\u201d of his own company\u2019s vision.Cisco also cooperates in various ways with A.W.S. and Microsoft in cloud computing. But Mr. Goeckeler said that the Google relationship was particularly potent because of the technological specialties of each company.\u201cWe are both users of each other\u2019s products,\u201d said Mr. H\u00f6lzle of Google. But in this case, this is about working together to give their customers the technology they want, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mattel Pulls Aristotle Children\u2019s Device After Privacy Concerns", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe product, based on the technology of Amazon\u2019s Alexa, boasted features such as the ability to soothe a crying baby, teach A B C\u2019s, reinforce good manners, play interactive games and help kids with homework. Marketed as an \u201call-in-one nursery necessity\u201d on Mattel\u2019s website, it also offered e-commerce functionality that would enable Aristotle to automatically reorder baby products based on user feedback.\u201cOne of the things that was so striking about this device is that we had so many different concerns. First of all, when you have a device with a camera and a microphone that\u2019s going to be in young children\u2019s bedrooms, there is the potential to collect so much data on children that can be used and shared with advertisers and retailers,\u201d said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. \u201cThen there are all these child development concerns about replacing essential parenting functions with a device.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mattel said that the decision not to bring Aristotle to the marketplace was prompted by new leadership in the company. She said that Sven Gerjets, the company\u2019s new chief technology officer, \u201cconducted an extensive review of the Aristotle product and decided that it did not fully align with Mattel\u2019s new technology strategy.\u201dMattel\u2019s recent announcement was met with praise. \u201cThis is a huge victory for everyone who believes that corporate profits and experimentation should never come at the expense of children\u2019s privacy and well-being,\u201d Mr. Golin said. \u201cWe commend Mattel for listening to the child development experts and thousands of parents who told them a child\u2019s bedroom should be free of corporate surveillance and that essential caregiving functions should never be outsourced to robots.\u201dEven though Aristotle didn\u2019t make it to market, Mr. Steyer said he is concerned that \u201cthe next version will look more like a toy \u2014 say, placed inside a cute teddy bear \u2014 and then it will be 2018\u2019s must-have present, followed shortly thereafter by security issues that either researchers or hackers will discover.\u201d\u201cThe ground rules of human beinghood are laid down very early,\u201d she said. And what she calls \u201cintimate machines\u201d have \u201cchanged the ground rules of how people think about personhood.\u201dThe stakes, according to Dr. Turkle, couldn\u2019t be higher. \u201cThis is not at all an anti-technology position. This is about a particular kind of technology, one that pretends empathy,\u201d Dr. Turkle said. \u201cWe can\u2019t put children in this position of pretend empathy and then expect that children will know what empathy is. Or give them pretend as-if relationships, and then think that we\u2019ll have children who know what relationships are. It really says a lot about how far we have gone down the path of forgetting what those things are.\u201dDr. Dimitri Christakis, co-author of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 2016 media guidelines for children under 6, said he is \u201cconstantly dismayed by how much we are technologizing childhood\u201d and believes it contributes to our dependency on digital devices.As for the Aristotle, Dr. Christakis said: \u201cI am not a fan. More to the point, Aristotle himself would not be. He said, among other things, \u2018Good habits formed at youth make all the difference.\u2019\u201dDr. Christakis said that beginning in infancy, children need not only the warmth of human interaction but also to learn to be alone and soothe or entertain themselves \u2014 without the constant presence of a digital device.\u201cI\u2019m glad that there was sufficient uproar and that this product went away, but it\u2019s not the last time we\u2019ll see such things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Rubenstein, Private Equity Titan, Passes the Torch", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt started with a series of meetings at the Carlyle Hotel in New York, and grew to become one of the world\u2019s most ambitious and well-connected private equity firms. Its Rolodex was unrivaled, and its advisers included the first President George Bush and John Major, the former British prime minister.All along the way, David M. Rubenstein has been the face of the Carlyle Group, which he co-founded 30 years ago. He has raised billions of dollars for investments, struck deals with brands including Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Beats Electronics, and lobbied Congress to protect a tax arrangement that made the private equity business so tremendously lucrative.Mr. Rubenstein also emerged as the rare Wall Street titan who enjoys the public spotlight, becoming ubiquitous on the boards of nonprofit organizations and in the media.Now, Mr. Rubenstein is volunteering to do less. On Wednesday, he and the other two co-founders of the firm \u2014 William E. Conway Jr. and Daniel A. D\u2019Aniello \u2014 announced they were handing over daily management of the firm to their chosen successors.Carlyle will be led by three familiar faces. Kewsong Lee, who joined Carlyle in 2013, and Glenn A. Youngkin, currently the firm\u2019s president and chief operating officer, will become co-chief executives. Peter J. Clare was named the firm\u2019s co-chief investment officer. All three men will join the board and begin their new roles on Jan. 1.Mr. Rubenstein will not be hard to find. An affable White House aide under President Jimmy Carter who became a self-made billionaire, he is a major philanthropist with a passion for American history, and is on the boards of organizations including the Brookings Institution, Lincoln Center, the University of Chicago and the Council on Foreign Relations.The Carlyle Group, which has headquarters in Washington, manages about $170 billion in assets around the world, spread across private equity, real estate and other investment funds.Though it was once best known for deals with defense businesses, it has since become a major investor in a wide range of sectors. Among private equity firms, it was one of the first to go beyond traditional corporate buyouts and develop extensive practices in real estate, infrastructure and credit.Investments include holdings in Getty Images and the health supplements maker Nature\u2019s Bounty.Mr. Rubenstein, however, said he regretted passing on opportunities to invest in Amazon and Netscape, deals that would have made the firm billions. \u201cI always remember the ones that got away,\u201d he said.Privately held until 2012, Carlyle joined other private equity firms in offering shares to the public in the years after the financial crisis. But since the initial public offering, Carlyle\u2019s stock price has barely budged. On Wednesday, the stock was down 3 percent on news of the succession planning.\u201cPublicly traded private equity firms are undervalued by the market,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said.Carlyle may not have been a great investment for public markets investors, but it has been lucrative for the co-founders. Thanks to the traditional private equity business model \u2014 in which firms charge investors a lucrative management fee, regardless of performance, and also take a large share of profits \u2014 companies like Carlyle are practically guaranteed to make money.And thanks to the so-called carried interest loophole, which Mr. Rubenstein has lobbied to protect, much of those profits are lightly taxed. Mr. Rubenstein, Mr. Conway and Mr. D\u2019Aniello are each worth $2.8 billion, according to Forbes. Since 2011 alone, the three co-founders have collected compensation worth some $3.2 billion combined, according to Equilar.Mr. Rubenstein said that he was troubled by the widening gap between rich and poor.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that income inequality in all developed markets is increasing, and the U.S. is no exception,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s attributable to many factors; education is probably the most important one. You can\u2019t sustain a very good economic system when people aren\u2019t graduating.\u201dBut Mr. Rubenstein said there was little he could do about it.\u201cI wish I had the power as one person to change that, but I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took us generations to get into the income inequality morass. I don\u2019t think anybody has enough money or energy to fix it. But I am certainly sensitive to it.\u201dMr. Rubenstein and Mr. Conway, who serve as co-chief executives, will become co-executive chairmen of the company. Mr. D\u2019Aniello, Carlyle\u2019s chairman, will become chairman emeritus.The changes will give Mr. Rubenstein more time to focus on his extracurricular activities, which he says have allowed him to engage in networking that has benefited Carlyle. A fan of American history, he has donated millions of dollars to help restore the Washington Monument and renovate museum galleries around Washington.\u201cI have taken on a fair number of high-profile nonprofit positions,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s hurt the firm; that\u2019s helped the firm.\u201dDavid Skorton, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, said that Mr. Rubenstein, who serves on the Smithsonian\u2019s board of regents, was uncommonly involved in his nonprofit work.\u201cHe actually thinks about the public interest,\u201d Mr. Skorton said. \u201cHe\u2019s a real student of history.\u201dStill, Mr. Rubenstein said he and his co-founders would try to stay involved in the firm without micromanaging their successors.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be helicopter parents,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re disappearing into the dust.\u201dChad Bray contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Inside Amazon, Diversity Concerns Flare Up After Harassment Accusations", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon on Friday tried to quell concerns among employees about sexual harassment accusations against an executive, sending an email to its staff saying the company would review its policies to ensure that \u201cthey are doing their job to provide a harassment-free workplace.\u201dThe email is the first broad internal communication by Amazon since Roy Price, who oversaw Amazon Studios, left the company this week after details of the accusations became public. A lawyer for the woman who has made the accusations said Amazon previously investigated and knew all the details about the episode, which happened in 2015.Amazon\u2019s handling of Mr. Price has set off confusion, debate and finger-pointing inside the company, according to two employees. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies, said numerous employees were heatedly discussing the timing of Mr. Price\u2019s departure.Some current and former employees are suggesting that the scarcity of women at the upper echelons of Amazon could have made the company more lenient toward Mr. Price until his actions became a public relations embarrassment.Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.The episode involving Mr. Price occurred in 2015 when he was in a car with Isa Dick Hackett, a Hollywood producer. She told investigators for Amazon shortly after the car ride that Mr. Price made unwanted sexual advances toward her.But there is confusion among some Amazon employees about why Mr. Price did not lose his job in 2015 after the company learned of Ms. Hackett\u2019s accusations. One consequence Mr. Price faced after the episode was being told to be careful how much alcohol he drank at work functions, according to a third employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies. The employee was briefed on the decision.Some of the frustration inside the company has been directed at Jeff Blackburn, the Amazon senior vice president who directly managed Mr. Price. Mr. Blackburn sent the email to Amazon\u2019s film and television employees on Friday, and it was more broadly distributed by other executives to their groups.In his email, Mr. Blackburn said Amazon was \u201ctaking this situation, and the general issue of sexual harassment, very seriously.\u201d He said it was not appropriate to share personnel details publicly, but said that Mr. Price\u2019s departure \u201cfollowed new information that surfaced last week, as well as other factors.\u201dCharles Harder, a lawyer for Mr. Price, did not respond to messages requesting comment.The pinnacle of Amazon is an elite group known as the S-team, roughly 16 senior executives, fewer than a dozen of whom report directly to Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive. Just one member of the S-team is a woman, Beth Galetti, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for human resources, according to two of the three employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In August, at a staff meeting for Amazon employees held at a basketball arena, Mr. Bezos was asked about the dearth of diversity \u2014 implying gender and race \u2014 on his senior leadership team. Amazon employees applauded loudly at the question.Mr. Bezos replied that diversity was important at Amazon, according to two of the employees who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. But Mr. Bezos said that adding more diversity to the leadership team would happen slowly because of low turnover in its ranks \u2014 an answer that left many employees disappointed.One of the Amazon employees, who recently looked at an organizational chart, said Amazon\u2019s S-team members and the people who report directly to them amount to roughly 90 people, about 75 of whom are men.Amazon has taken some steps in recent years to make working at the company more appealing to women. Two years ago, it instituted a more generous maternity leave policy, providing birth mothers with up to 20 weeks of paid leave.But the company\u2019s office culture still has a hard-charging reputation that could make it harder to recruit more women. Textio, a Seattle start-up that uses software to analyze language, has examined public job postings for all the major internet companies. The company found that the language in Amazon\u2019s skewed most sharply to the masculine end of the spectrum, with frequent use of words like \u201cwickedly,\u201d \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201cmaniacal.\u201dJodi Kantor contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sight and Insight in the California Desert", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "The artist Andrea Zittel has spent nearly 20 years exploring solitude. Now, she\u2019s inviting others to join her.Supported byOn my second evening alone in the California high desert, I realize how much I\u2019m looking forward to lighting the glass oil lamp. My home for this scorchingly hot week in June is a one-room cabin without electricity or running water that my host, the artist Andrea Zittel, has purposefully left nearly bare, and I\u2019m craving the flame\u2019s intricate shadow, the only baroque fillip in this spartan interior. As daylight drains from the wide, empty plain outside the uncurtained windows, and the darkness makes the uncanny quiet feel even more silent, I fall into a brief reverie about the human hunger for ornamentation and the expressionlessness of my electric lamps back home. Mundane revelations, perhaps, but insights into the ordinary are the point of living in this spare box tucked into a landscape as strange and sweltering as Venus, with little to occupy me but uninterrupted thoughts about how I conduct every bit of my life, down to the way I brush my teeth or wipe my hands on a dish towel.Like her predecessors, Zittel\u2019s material is also the Southwestern desert, but she isn\u2019t a land artist in the traditional mode: Instead of moving earth with giant machines, or leaving hulking, unpeopled abstractions amid the dust, she employs this vast landscape to explore and challenge the quotidian functions of our existence. She was trained as a sculptor and still considers herself one, but her art is really a kind of philosophical quest, one that involves an ongoing and intense examination of what it means to live: What do we really mean when we say we need shelter, community, clothes, tools, light? How elaborate a space \u2014 indeed, how much space, down to the millimeter \u2014 do we need to survive, to thrive? What structures best facilitate creativity, serenity, unity?What makes Zittel\u2019s art seem so urgent at this moment is that the culture appears to have caught up to her at last: In our era of rapidly shifting domestic arrangements, nearly everyone \u2014 young people living alone or aging couples in communal compounds \u2014 seems badly served by architecture designed for the increasingly vestigial nuclear family. The cultish Marie Kondo\u2019s admonitions to cast out the nonessential seems ripped from Zittel\u2019s playbook; the conceptual underpinnings for the swelling phalanx of tiny, modular dwellings that evade byzantine zoning regulations and create a more mobile society can be found in Zittel\u2019s experiments as well.During her nearly two decades in the barren, windswept wasteland, her practice has gone from an isolated curiosity to a complete operational community constructed to outlive her, a \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass\u201d laboratory that reflects our contemporary fascination with the spaces in which we live. From ur-furniture that makes even the concept of a chair seem quaint, to vessels that force us to question the notion of a drinking glass, Zittel\u2019s work reminds us that the elemental building blocks of human society are ultimately domestic \u2014 and that revolution begins in private.\u201cI don\u2019t want people to be uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t want them to feel comfortable, either,\u201d Zittel tells me. \u201cYou know when you\u2019re alone with yourself and you feel jangly and on edge? But in a way that\u2019s the most cathartic thing in the world? Almost painful, but so good?\u201dWe are discussing my stay in the \u201cExperimental Living Cabins\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m on day four of seven \u2014 in the kitchen of Zittel\u2019s home, which is in the center of A-Z West and has, over the years, been expanded from a shack into a chic, colorful oasis filled with her own designs, including 2011\u2019s \u201cAggregated Stacks\u201d (wall shelves made from plaster-covered cardboard shipping boxes from Amazon) and \u201cLinear Sequence\u201d (2016), a low-to-the-ground sculpture of tabletops and floor cushions that functions as a living room. She shares it with her 13-year-old son, Emmett, and a menagerie that includes three dogs, a cat, six chickens, four rescue pigeons, three rescue tortoises and three fish.Zittel is 52, 5-foot-6, and lanky, with shoulder-length reddish-brown hair she often pulls back in a long braid. For decades, she\u2019s worn the same outfit every day for a predetermined period \u2014 she\u2019s been wearing her current one for about three months \u2014 an extension of \u201cA-Z Uniforms,\u201d a work she began back in Brooklyn. When I visited, she\u2019d been too busy to finish assembling that summer\u2019s ensemble, so was still in her spring getup \u2014 a black sleeveless muscle tee, a floor-length black denim A-line skirt and black Birkenstocks. There were thin black onyx rings on all of her fingers; her bare arms were those of someone who regularly lifts heavy objects. Based on her minimalist, cerebral aesthetic, I\u2019d expected her to be austere and aloof. But as I watched her make the rounds of the property, conferring with assistants and checking on the artists bent over the kiln, she projected a regal serenity, asking questions and waiting patiently for the answer before responding in a cadence she once conceded has a bit of Valley Girl in it. The Brooklyn-based artist Rachel Harrison, who has known Zittel for 20 years, since they both lived in Williamsburg, calls her \u201clegendarily generous,\u201d especially to young artists, several hundred of whom have spent time at A-Z West over the years.But Zittel\u2019s own work is always the soul of the machine. In 2004 she started the \u201cWagon Station Encampment,\u201d 12 domed aluminum-clad units around a central outdoor kitchen that marry the proportions of a frontier-era covered wagon with the modernity of a Subaru Outback; there is just enough space for one person to sleep or sit up, and a few hooks for personal items. Over the years, during which dozens of artists have stayed in them for weeks at a time, she has assiduously maintained the wagons, two early versions of which are owned by the Guggenheim; from a distance, they gleam like fallen satellites in a lunar terrain. Several months ago, she opened her latest permanent site-specific work, \u201cPlanar Pavilions,\u201d a loose grid of 10 configurations of black-painted cinder-block walls of varying heights \u2014 some low enough to sit on, others as tall and imposing as linebackers \u2014 along a gentle slope, which calls to mind the crumbled foundations of a future civilization as well as the constellation of concrete boxes Donald Judd installed in the early 1980s on his own property in Marfa, Tex.I have driven west to see her from the \u201cExperimental Living Cabins,\u201d set on 15 acres a 40-minute drive away in Wonder Valley, a desolate, unincorporated corner of the Mojave Desert, near the joyless sprawl of Twentynine Palms, home to one of the largest military training areas in the country. Zittel started buying up acreage to add to her holdings several years ago, attracted by the site\u2019s remoteness and the several ramshackle \u201cjackrabbit homesteads\u201d on the property (really, little more than a dusty patch of desert), relics of the Small Tract Act of 1938, which lured pioneers to \u201cprove up\u201d five acres. (The terrain is so inhospitable that few actually stayed.) She now owns three of the cabins, though only two are renovated: simple board-and-batten structures, painted gray with white trim, that stand alone amid the scrub brush, 600 feet apart in the wide, flat basin rimmed in the distance by purpled mountains. She originally intended to use them for herself \u2014 ironically, between occasional afternoon visitors and the residents who come for longer stays in exchange for help with site maintenance, A-Z West is such a hive these days that Zittel rarely has the alone time she craves \u2014 but like most elements in her life, the cabins have become part of her work, perhaps even the ultimate expression of it.When she bought the land in Wonder Valley, she was in the midst of making a series of sculptures called \u201cPlanar Configurations,\u201d based on her longstanding fascination with the \u201cplanar panel\u201d \u2014 basically, anything that is rectangular, whether a 4-by-8 piece of plywood, a 8\u00bd-by-11 sheet of printer paper or a table top. Each sculpture, made of wood, red fiberglass and black-matte aluminum or steel, is a set of interconnected rectangles, like a 3D Mondrian, that function as a table, bed, counter and room divider. Last year, Zittel, always frustrated by how few people actually get to interact with her work, and ever on the lookout for ways to finance her many projects, had a revelation: She could put a \u201cPlanar Configuration\u201d inside each of the cabins, and allow people to stay in them, for rates comparable to a nearby Airbnb. It would be the first time that a stranger could reside in Zittel\u2019s universe full time, in utter privacy, in contrast to the \u201cWagon Station Encampment\u201d with its communal ethos and group activities.The \u201cExperimental Living Cabins,\u201d at which I am one of the first guests, are intended for solo visitors who stay anywhere from two days to three weeks, and though a smattering of boxy one-story houses dot the area, they are so low, and so distant, that it\u2019s easy to forget they exist at all. One can go for days without human interaction, or one can hop in the car and drive down the dirt road to the Palms Restaurant for a beer. The point of the cabins isn\u2019t to enact the now-clich\u00e9d off-the-grid adventure, but to exist just a few steps outside real life, in a stripped-down but completely functional environment \u2014 to re-examine, even relearn, everyday activities. A welcome disorientation, even an epiphany or two, might arise from doing without conventional touchstones like, say, a mirror, or a refrigerator. (Visitors are given a supply of bottled water, but bring in their own food and ice to stock the cooler.)And there is plenty of furniture in the literal sense, just not anything that reads easily as such. \u201cI do believe in a certain amount of comfort,\u201d Zittel says. \u201cI believe in having a good spot to position your body so you can relax and do things. But I want people to find their own comfort without being catered to. It\u2019s not just waiting there for you.\u201dShe is intimately familiar with the comfortable-uncomfortable sensation that the cabins can evoke; it characterized her early years in the desert. When Zittel left Brooklyn in 2000, many in the art world viewed it as a surprising retrenchment or even the end of her career. She had spent almost a decade represented by the acclaimed Andrea Rosen Gallery, showing such apparently urban-inflected works as the 1994 \u201cA-Z Living Units,\u201d a precursor to the \u201cPlanar Configurations\u201d \u2014 portable pods that seemed inspired by cramped studios: Barbie\u2019s-Dreamhouse-by-way-of-Bauhaus.Although she had grown up north of San Diego and spent time at her grandparents\u2019 ranch in California\u2019s Imperial Valley, she didn\u2019t yearn for the wilderness in her 10 years in New York. There were no signs in her work of the organic monumentalism synonymous with the sculptors and conceptualists who first decamped for the desert, and she didn\u2019t seem the type to erect a permanent museum of her art, as did the assemblage artist Noah Purifoy, a pioneer when he left L.A. for Joshua Tree in the 1980s. Nor did she give indications of wanting to create a conventional home and burrow into a solitary relationship with two-dimensional work, as had the female artists who famously forsook New York City for the Southwest, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Agnes Martin. She was social, hosting weekly cocktail parties in her Williamsburg townhouse.But as others began discovering Brooklyn, she began feeling a pull toward the sun-blasted, desolate terrain of her childhood. Zittel sees herself as part of the 20th-century tradition of American artists leaving cities for the open spaces of the Southwest, but she is aware of her deviations. O\u2019Keeffe and Martin chose the desert as a form of retreat, but Zittel saw it as liberation. As for the parallels often drawn between her and the largely male artists who came to make their massive, macho marks on the desert, she gently notes that she is not interested in \u201cgrand interventions,\u201d only in finding meaning in intimate, everyday gestures. \u201cThe act of inhabiting and having an evolving relationship with a space or place is inherently different from the act of installing works like \u2018Spiral Jetty\u2019 or \u2018Double Negative,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says.During my stay in the cabin, I established a routine determined by the movements of the sun: After daylight nudged me awake around five, I rose from the bed portion of the \u201cPlanar Configuration\u201d and unlocked both doors to let in the early cross-breeze. Then I scooped ant corpses from the ice cooler and retrieved my sack of ground coffee. I checked my shoes for scorpions/tarantulas, and stepped outside to the composting toilet. I\u2019d save the outdoor shower \u2014 a water tank modified with a hand pump \u2014 for later in the day, when the heat was unbearable. Then it was off to assess the dwindling freshwater reserve and to conduct frugal ablutions over a steel sink that drained through a black hose into a bucket below. I filled the kettle. Ignited the propane stove. Set out French press, bowl and spoon. (In keeping with Zittel\u2019s catechism, there are only bowls, never glasses or plates, which she deems unnecessarily use-specific.) Carried two black wooden vintage stools out to the patio, one for sitting, the other for my breakfast and books. Every time a bead of perspiration rolled down my leg, I\u2019d assume it was an ant and tried to flick it off, never learning.In the afternoon, the hot wind in my face like a blow dryer on high, I drove to the air-conditioned local library, with Zittel\u2019s blessing; the cabin stay is meant to be challenging but not life-threatening. Back home around 6:00 p.m., I cooked a meal of spiced beans, avocado and tortillas and washed up in the final sliver of sun. After lighting the oil lanterns, I watched their flickering patterns, then sat outside to read. By 9:30 p.m. I was asleep, atop white sheets, enveloped in unbroken darkness.Before my trip, I\u2019d been thinking about Zittel in relation to the social-utopia-makers of the 19th century, the \u201cmaterial feminists\u201d who sought liberation by transforming the domestic sphere. In 1868, Melusina Fay Peirce, an organizer and author, spearheaded the \u201ccooperative housekeeping movement,\u201d proposing that wives charge their husbands for their domestic labor. The writer and reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman argued for taking the kitchen out of the house, making it communal and hiring cooks to lessen the burden of \u201cwomen\u2019s work.\u201d Could Zittel\u2019s heady innovations be postmodern descendants of these ideas?But perched on a stool with the oil lamp and a book, the night astonishingly silent save for a lone coyote in the distance, I realized that Zittel isn\u2019t interested in changing society or achieving political or social perfection, but is instead seeking liberation of a more private sort. Because here\u2019s the strange thing: I never did get bored, or lonely, or restless during my stint in Zittel\u2019s world. For all my physical discomfort throughout the week, I felt deeply, supremely calm. Existing alone in an unfamiliar space in which every detail has been considered and honed to its ultimate function was simultaneously soothing and stimulating. Engaged so closely with my immediate surroundings, I was able to drown out my ever-present anxieties. Bowls were no longer just bowls: They were the sole necessary vessel. Without a chair back, I sat up taller and lay down on the ground to watch the stars. I began to see the cabins as performance art, but with the artist herself absent \u2014 or, maybe, with the viewer taking the artist\u2019s role. There was a kind of generosity, or trust, in that gesture.In the days and weeks following, long after I returned home, I saw rectangles everywhere \u2014 counter, bed, ceiling, blanket, book, cover, page. Even a line of text is a long, narrow rectangle. Viewed like this, through Zittel\u2019s eyes, the material world seemed endlessly malleable, little more than a sequence of man-made conventions we\u2019ve all agreed to preserve, whether or not they have outlived their usefulness, that were now merely burying \u2014 or distracting \u2014 us with infinite variety.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aetna Could Offer CVS Valuable Protection", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAetna\u2019s third-quarter results show its value to CVS Health. Revenue at the $56 billion health-coverage firm fell 5 percent in the three months to the end of September, partly because it pulled out of health insurance exchanges. But profit jumped 48 percent as the company kept costs under control. That offers alluring protection for CVS, whose pharmacy and drug-benefit business is threatened by rising competition and transparency.Amazon is at the forefront of this challenge. The internet company is ramping up an effort to sell pills and other goods to patients \u2014 and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, regards short-term profit as an afterthought.CVS\u2019s other business is to act as the middleman negotiating cheaper drug prices and keeping part of the savings. Decent returns here depend on keeping the market opaque. Clients, however, are wondering if the system benefits them; reducing the murkiness of price setting, whether by political process or Amazon-inspired competition, could leave less for CVS.Now consider Aetna. The firm\u2019s management wouldn\u2019t talk about CVS\u2019s bid on the earnings call with investors. But it covers more than 22 million people with its medical plans and is becoming better at figuring out how to squeeze more profit out of them by reducing spending.In its big health care segment, its medical benefits ratio \u2014 a key measure of costs relative to premiums \u2014 decreased to 81.5 percent in the first nine months of 2017, an improvement of a fifth of a percentage point from the same period last year. That helped it to easily beat analysts\u2019 profit estimate. Aetna also raised earnings guidance for the full year.Finding growth will be more difficult for Aetna. Extracting itself from the individual policy market for Obamacare probably means a stagnant top line in 2018. Merging with big direct rivals is also out of the question after regulators shot down its proposed deal for Humana. That makes a CVS bid and its 25 percent premium to Aetna\u2019s undisturbed share price more tempting.The real attraction of Aetna, however, is its potential for sending all these clients CVS\u2019s way. CVS has made a big push into offering medical services such as vaccinations, routine medical care for earaches and even home infusions. It\u2019s more convenient for patients and cheaper than an emergency room. That combination could keep Aetna\u2019s higher profit trend going \u2014 straight into the combined firm\u2019s pocket.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Amazon Book Battle", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook News\u201cI want to beat them,\u201d said Mark Rubbo, Readings\u2019 co-owner, discussing Amazon as he stared across Lygon Street to where Borders used to be. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of this monolith devouring everything.\u201dBut changing Australians\u2019 reading habits may be more of a challenge. Books are bellwethers of great symbolic weight, not just because they were Amazon\u2019s first product and because the company often uses them to wedge itself into new markets, but also because books and bookstores are tightly linked to Australia\u2019s sense of itself, and to the country\u2019s beloved ecosystem of local commerce.This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school.Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia\u2019s book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States.Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they\u2019ll eventually embrace and come to love.Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon\u2019s arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia\u2019s own writing, and way of life.\u201cOur culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,\u201d Mr. Rubbo said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to defend our voice.\u201dAmazon\u2019s first \u201cfulfillment center\u201d in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products.Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia\u2019s minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom.What comes next is anyone\u2019s guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions.Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn\u2019t explained why it\u2019s taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon\u2019s American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne.Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia\u2019s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers\u2019 hands, in some cases on the same day they\u2019re ordered.\u201cIt\u2019s not about price,\u201d Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, \u201cit\u2019s about the logistics.\u201dBut isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt.For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work.\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people like supporting local businesses.\u201d\u201cI would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,\u201d he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne.But just below his own bookish calm \u2014 and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books \u2014 there are wider concerns.In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged.One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia\u2019s big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers\u2019 orders at the end of the line.The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia\u2019s labor, tax and import laws in its favor.Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected.But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia\u2019s literary culture.The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books.Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation.\u201cWhat makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,\u201d said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: \u201cIt\u2019s a retrograde move.\u201dInside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see.Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent?\u201cWe have a lot of questions,\u201d said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years.He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone.The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia\u2019s well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere.Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. \u201cI like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn\u2019t find otherwise,\u201d said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening.Amazon\u2019s deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price.Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers. She said she was told not to fret. \u201cThey were giving me a bit of a pep talk really,\u201d she said.But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent. Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment. Michael Gordon-Smith, the chief executive of the Australian Publishers Association, sent a statement by email: \u201cWe welcome any new ways to get books to Australian readers and any new investment in the Australian industry that is consistent with good corporate citizenship and respect for creators\u2019 rights.\u201dMs. Wilson and Mr. Rubbo both said that Amazon\u2019s power could bend the will of even the well-intentioned. In their nightmares, they see declining revenues, shuttered stores and silent, dying neighborhoods.\u201cIt\u2019s really crucial that these places survive and thrive,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cI wish I was more optimistic.\u201dTacey Rychter contributed reporting from Sydney.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tillerson Visits Iraq to Chilly Reception Over His Remarks on Iran-Backed Militias", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAGHDAD \u2014 Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson slipped into Iraq Monday night after having spent the morning in Afghanistan, but his welcome in Baghdad was far less effusive as the Trump administration pushes to isolate Iran, an important Iraqi ally.The diplomatic challenges for the United States in Iraq have become a minefield of competing interests as the Islamic State surrenders the last of its Iraqi territory and a host of squabbling groups fight to fill the vacuum.After meeting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq, Mr. Tillerson called for unity in the country, long troubled by sectarian and tribal divisions.\u201cWe are concerned and have been saddened by the recent differences that have emerged between the Kurdistan regional government and the Iraqi central government,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said in statements made to reporters after he had met with Mr. Abadi.Asserting that \u201cwe have friends\u201d in Baghdad and the Kurdish region\u2019s capital, Erbil, Mr. Tillerson said \u201cwe encourage both parties to enter into discussion and dialogue.\u201dHours before Mr. Tillerson arrived, Mr. Abadi\u2019s office released a testy statement rejecting Tillerson\u2019s call the previous day for Iranian-backed militias \u2014 known as popular mobilization forces or Hashad al-Shaabi \u2014 to either disband or leave Iraq.Although the militias may be armed and trained by Iran, the militia members are Iraqis.\u201cWe wonder about the statements attributed to the American secretary of state about the popular mobilization forces,\u201d the statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said.The militias were recruited and integrated into the Iraqi military in 2014 after Islamic State militants swept through parts of Iraq and seized nearly a third of the country despite years of effort and billions of dollars spent by the United States to train government forces.A top Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassam Suleimani, has advised the militias inside Iraq, prompting some Iraqi lawmakers to describe them as an arm of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps.The militias maintain individual commands separate from the Iraqi military command and often fly Shiite banners and flags at Iraqi Army checkpoints.Members of the militias are Iraqi patriots who \u201chave sacrificed greatly to defend their country,\u201d Mr. Abadi\u2019s statement said. \u201cNo side has the right to intervene in Iraq\u2019s affairs or decide what Iraqis should do.\u201dIn a news conference on Sunday with Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Tillerson said that \u201cIranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close, those militias need to go home. Any foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home and allow the Iraqi people to regain control of areas that had been overtaken by ISIS.\u201dAides later tried to clarify his remarks as only meaning that Iraq\u2019s military needed a unified chain of command, but the Trump administration\u2019s fiercely anti-Iran rhetoric \u2014 President Trump has denounced Iran repeatedly and threatened to renounce the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 has discomfited Iraqis.A spokesman for the popular mobilization forces, Ahmed al-Assadi, told the Iraqi Parliament in Baghdad on Monday that he considered Mr. Tillerson\u2019s comments an \u201cunacceptable and false accusation.\u201dMr. Assadi, a Shiite member of Parliament, said Mr. Tillerson\u2019s remarks reflected a \u201clack of experience.\u201dThe Americans have encouraged improvements in Iraq\u2019s relations with Sunni Arab states in hopes of reducing Iran\u2019s influence. Mr. Abadi was in Riyadh on Sunday along with Mr. Tillerson to strengthen ties.Earlier Monday, Mr. Tillerson made a secret two-hour visit to the main American air base in Afghanistan, arriving in a military transport plane to meet top Afghan officials inside a massive bunker.His visit to Iraq was similarly unannounced before he landed.That top American officials must use stealth to enter these countries after more than 15 years of war, thousands of lives lost and trillions of dollars spent was testimony to the stubborn problems still confronting the United States in both places.Mr. Tillerson\u2019s visit was his first to Afghanistan as secretary of state, and like nearly every other top American official to visit over the previous two decades, he said the country\u2019s predicament was not nearly as dire as his own security precautions suggested.\u201cBut I think if you consider the current situation in Afghanistan, and we were talking about this a few minutes ago, and you look a few years in the past to what the circumstances were, Afghanistan has come quite a distance already in terms of creating a much more vibrant population, a much more vibrant government, education system, a larger economy,\u201d he said in a small windowless conference room during a hurried eight-minute news conference. \u201cSo there are opportunities to strengthen the foundations of a prosperous Afghanistan society.\u201dMr. Trump also promised to pressure Pakistan, which United States officials have long accused of playing a double game in Afghanistan \u2014 publicly supporting the United States presence while privately protecting the Taliban and other insurgent groups.The massive air base near Kabul demonstrates why the administration cannot get too tough with Pakistan, since nearly all of the supplies are transported by air or land through Pakistani territory. Soldiers can order supplies and gifts from Amazon, which delivers daily to the base.On Monday, Mr. Tillerson said that the United States was increasingly concerned about the stability of Pakistan, which has a large nuclear arsenal.\u201cPakistan needs to, I think, take a cleareyed view of the situation that they\u2019re confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan,\u201d he said.David Zucchino contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We Don\u2019t Vote With Our Wallets", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the list of companies I dislike, Amazon ranks near the top, for putting bookstores out of business everywhere and destroying the ability of authors and publishers to earn a living. Having fed itself to monstrous size on such small potatoes, the company has now moved on to gut the rest of Main Street retail and cut the heart out of communities everywhere.And yet I shop at Amazon. My lame excuse is that it\u2019s now a 25-minute drive to the nearest independent bookstore, it\u2019s convenient to have a book turn up at my door, and the price looks right.This inconsistency isn\u2019t just an issue for left-leaners like me. Starbucks faced a right-wing boycott early this year when it responded to President Trump\u2019s immigration ban with a pledge to hire 10,000 refugees. But new research by Brayden King at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management shows \u201czero correlation\u201d between public commitments to that boycott and subsequent purchasing behavior by pro-Trump consumers. That is, our failure to vote with our wallets crosses political lines. (United at last!)Withholding our cash from companies that cause harm or behave badly is one of the few avenues of protest we have as consumers. So why are we so bad at boycotting?The resulting boycotts may seem effective. Mr. Kalanick was out of a job soon after the #DeleteUber campaign early this year. And the furor against Barilla didn\u2019t just elicit a mortified apology from Mr. Barilla. His company also undertook enough remedial action to earn a 100 rating just a year later in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s annual Corporate Equality Index. (It\u2019s still at 100 today.) But these success stories typically have less to do with consumer purchasing power than with the sharp bite of bad publicity.Outrageous remarks by executives tend, in any case, to be largely a distraction. They catch our attention and trigger our emotions. Meanwhile, we get bored and look away from the dull crimes companies commit every day, like Wells Fargo foisting phony accounts and unwanted auto insurance on its customers. Like Mylan gouging patients and government health care programs with a 500 percent markup on EpiPens. Like Volkswagen selling \u201cclean diesel\u201d cars that ran clean only long enough to fool emissions testing equipment. Like Exxon funding climate change disinformation. We are terrible, that is, at boycotting business as usual.So how do we make our boycotts more effective? How do we avoid wasting energy on the foot-in-mouth moments of dunderheaded executives and instead act on weightier issues? One answer is to accept that boycotts are about publicity, not consumer choice, and advertise wonky ethical positions like any other product: in vivid emotional terms.The film \u201cBlackfish\u201d didn\u2019t just attack SeaWorld for keeping orca whales in captivity. It made Tilikum, taken from the wild in 1983 and kept in captivity until his death early this year, the personification \u2014 the whale-ification \u2014 of that issue. Likewise, Jimmy Kimmel didn\u2019t just add another set of charts to the health insurance debate. He held up a picture of his infant son born with a heart defect and reshaped the debate in terms of how proposed changes would affect kids like his.Large-scale institutional forces can also ameliorate the frustrated consumer\u2019s abiding sense of inconsistency. I can\u2019t swear off heating oil just yet, but I can support the fossil fuel divestment campaign, which has persuaded institutions worth $5.5 trillion to shed at least some fossil fuel investments. I can also divest individually, in my retirement account, with the help of socially responsible mutual funds, which have lately proliferated, some with impressive results. (The website Fossil Free Funds allows investors to scan their holdings for hidden fossil fuel investments. And it\u2019s not just about climate change: A start-up called Motif Investing now also enables investors to construct a portfolio aligned more or less precisely with their individual values.)Am I actually doing these things? Only partly. I have begun the process with my retirement account and will complete it by year\u2019s end.I\u2019m not under the delusion that the investment choices of people like me are going to cause financial harm to socially irresponsible companies, any more than participating in a boycott would. But I like the idea of helping to move those companies into the pariah class.It\u2019s partly about helping me sleep better. But mostly, it\u2019s about making the managers of those companies sleep worse.Advertisement"}

The company\u2019s goal, executives said, is to allow anyone with an internet connection to become proficient with technology and prepare for a job in areas like information technology support and app development.Google detailed its job training program as Silicon Valley faces increasing criticism over what some say is an unchecked influence over business and society. Google is also among a number of companies facing scrutiny over the role their internet services played in Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\u201cWe understand there\u2019s uncertainty and even concern about the pace of technological change, but we know that technology will be an engine of America\u2019s growth for years to come,\u201d Mr. Pichai said. \u201cThe nature of work is fundamentally changing, and that is shifting the link between education, training and opportunity.\u201dGoogle plans to donate $1 billion to nonprofits through its charitable arm, Google.org, with the aim of addressing the gap between the skills required by modern companies and the skills that are taught in schools. Google said it was donating $10 million to Goodwill Industries, for example, for digital job training programs. Company employees also will volunteer one million hours at those nonprofits.Google has long been a leader in research on artificial intelligence, and Mr. Pichai has made it the centerpiece of his company\u2019s plans.

{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe May Collide on Taxing Apple and Amazon", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat rivalry has the potential to fuel tensions between the United States and its allies. Yet it could turn out that the European crackdown on American multinationals will ultimately help \u2014 rather than hobble \u2014 Washington\u2019s efforts to get them to pay up. The harder that other countries make it for American companies to take advantage of tax havens and sweetheart deals abroad, the weaker the incentives are for businesses to stash money out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\u201cIf we don\u2019t move to a more modern system, we may lose the ability to gain that revenue,\u201d Mr. Camp warned.\u201cThose are like dinosaurs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving towards extinction.\u201dSo far, the team of Trump administration officials and lawmakers who drew up the latest framework for rewriting the tax code has released mostly general principles.Now the I.R.S. taxes the worldwide profits of American corporations, but the tax kicks in only after that income is repatriated to the United States. As a result, American multinationals simply don\u2019t bring much of it home. Republicans have made clear they intend to switch to taxing only profits earned within the United States, what\u2019s known as a territorial system.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.The $2.6 trillion in foreign profits that corporations already parked overseas in order to escape paying the I.R.S. would be required to be repatriated \u2014 although taxed at a steep discount. And there are promises to prevent the tax base from shrinking, and discourage businesses from putting more operations and earnings overseas. At the same time, the official corporate rate would be slashed to 20 percent, from 35 percent, to make American companies more competitive with their foreign rivals.But this frame still lacks a picture, missing the details of how to accomplish those ambitious if sometimes conflicting goals.Without tough safeguards, for example, the shift away from a worldwide system could end up curbing rather than promoting investment at home as American companies move even more operations overseas to avoid paying any United States taxes.To some experts, like Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College, the only way to prevent American companies from exploiting loopholes in a new territorial regime is with a minimum tax. If a company\u2019s tax rate fell below the floor in, say, Bermuda, it would have to pay the difference to the I.R.S.Other experts, though, suggest borrowing another idea to broaden the tax base from foreign tax regulators \u2014 like more aggressive efforts to tax foreign multinationals.\u201cAll of these other countries are basically trying to beef up and protect their tax base by ensuring foreign multinationals pay tax on income earned in their country,\u201d he added, \u201cand not on income earned by their own domestic multinationals.\u201dThis is a different tack from the one taken in the United States, where tax dodges by homegrown billion-dollar corporations have been criticized for increasing the tax burden on companies that can\u2019t shield assets.The complaint that the American tax code favors foreign multinationals over domestic ones did, however, arouse interest last week at Senate hearings on a tax overhaul.The delay, he said, means that the United States is, in effect, paying \u201cforeign investors to take over our companies with our own tax dollars.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lord & Taylor Building, Icon of New York Retail, Will Become WeWork Headquarters", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the moment its doors opened more than a century ago, the Lord & Taylor building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan has stood as a monument to old-school retail.But now, the forces buffeting the retail industry are diminishing Lord & Taylor\u2019s presence as a New York institution. The company that owns the department store chain, Hudson\u2019s Bay, said Tuesday that it was selling off the flagship store to WeWork, a seven-year-old start-up whose office-sharing model is helping to reinvent the concept of work space.Lord & Taylor will rent out about a quarter of the building, where it will operate a pared-down department store. WeWork will use the rest of the building for its global headquarters and to lease shared office space to its customers. The redesign is expected to come after Christmas of 2018.Although online shopping companies have created hundreds of thousands of jobs, they have not directly made up for the losses at traditional retailers, and the new jobs tend to be concentrated in a small number of large cities.\u201cThe department store really is a dinosaur,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. \u201cAnd its demise is ongoing.\u201dAs Lord & Taylor struggles to find its footing in the e-commerce age, WeWork is capitalizing on the needs of the new economy. The company is offering flexibility and informality to a generation that is increasingly untethered to traditional offices. It allows workers like entrepreneurs or graphic designers to choose the size and style of the space they prefer, and to lease it for as long or short as they want. A motto on its website reads, \u201cMake a life, not just a living.\u201dWeWork has expanded from two locations in New York City when it was founded in 2010 to more than 160 locations in 52 cities this year. It has pushed into increasingly prominent locations for its co-working spaces over the years \u2014 but nothing on the order of the Lord & Taylor building.Across the United States, retailers are rethinking the uses of their physical spaces, as more shopping moves online. Many struggling malls have converted their stores into rock-climbing gyms, movie theaters and community colleges to try to attract customers. Other shopping centers stand mostly empty.Over the past year, Macy\u2019s has closed dozens of its department stores, though it has held on to its main property on 34th Street in Manhattan. And Hudson\u2019s Bay, whose roots lie in real estate development, is well known for its creative use of financial engineering tied to the property it owns.Still, selling off landmark properties comes with risks. Many old-line retailers have struggled to strike a balance between cashing out their valuable real estate holdings while retaining the historic buildings that define their brands. Despite the growth of e-commerce, the vast majority of shopping is still done in stores.\u201cLord & Taylor has really had a difficult 25 years,\u201d said Peter J. Solomon, a longtime deal maker in the retail industry who founded the namesake investment banking firm. \u201cBut good urban retailing is going to be successful. All these young people with money moving into cities are not only using Amazon.\u201dFounded by the English merchant Samuel Lord in 1826, Lord & Taylor\u2019s department store was once a favored retailer of high society. When its Fifth Avenue building opened in February 1914, it drew 75,000 visitors, who were treated to music from a pipe organ on the seventh floor and could choose to dine in one of three restaurants on the top floor.The Christmas decorations in its street-level windows have long been a staple of the city\u2019s holiday season, drawing many thousands of tourists and New Yorkers alike.But when the company moved into the mass market, it lost much of its luster.The company began to recover about a decade ago under Richard Baker, a veteran real estate investor. He led a 2006 takeover of the department store company, and used that as a springboard for further acquisitions, from the Canadian chain Hudson\u2019s Bay to Saks and the e-commerce outlet Gilt Groupe. He put all the brands together under the umbrella of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company.But as the tidal waves of e-commerce batter traditional retailers, Hudson\u2019s Bay has seen its stock price fall by nearly a third over the past year. Retail sales at Hudson\u2019s Bay were down about 1 percent in the first half of the year. As of Tuesday\u2019s close, the company had a market capitalization of roughly $1.7 billion, or a tenth of WeWork\u2019s private market valuation.One of Hudson\u2019s Bay\u2019s shareholders, the real estate investment firm Land and Buildings Investment Management, has pushed for the company to sell the Saks store, suggesting that it might be desirable to a hotel developer or as a brick-and-mortar space for the online giant Amazon.That pressure apparently has had an impact. Last week, the department store operator said that its chief executive, Gerald L. Storch, had stepped down and that he would be replaced on an interim basis by Mr. Baker.The roots of Tuesday\u2019s sale announcement lay in talks that Mr. Baker had months ago with Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, well before Land and Buildings made its recommendation.\u201cWhat we figured out is that, for the retail business, we could make our stores more interesting and younger,\u201d Mr. Baker said. Meanwhile, WeWork \u201cwas looking for great locations that were convenient and fun.\u201dIn addition to the building sale, WeWork\u2019s private equity partner in its real estate joint venture, Rh\u00f4ne Capital, will invest $500 million in Hudson\u2019s Bay. That will give the retailer more breathing room to invest in strategies that help it better compete with Amazon and other online retailers.The Hudson\u2019s Bay deals are meant to give WeWork prime real estate, particularly in Midtown Manhattan, with a way to blend street-level retail space with upper-floor real estate more useful for shared office space.\u201cRetail is changing, and the role that real estate has to play in the way that we shop today must change with it,\u201d Mr. Neumann said in a statement. \u201cThe opportunity to develop this partnership with H.B.C. to explore this trend was too good to pass up.\u201dWhile WeWork normally leases space in commercial buildings, it set up a division, WeWork Property Advisors, to buy some property outright. Among the advantages of buying property is that the start-up would be able to enjoy any rise in the value of the real estate.\u201cThe Saks store is way too productive in the luxury retail business to handle any other uses,\u201d he said.On Tuesday afternoon, as a light rain fell, a steady flow of shoppers entered and exited under the arch at Lord & Taylor\u2019s Fifth Avenue entranceway. Standing under scaffolding protecting her from the drizzle, Tamara Citroen said the building\u2019s sale was not a surprise. She shops regularly at the flagship store, she said, but acknowledged that it could be a hassle with all the tourists flooding the area.\u201cI prefer to shop online,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the date that Lord & Taylor\u2019s flagship store would be reduced to less than a quarter of its building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. It will happen after Christmas next year, not by Christmas next year.Zach Wichter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jean Rollin and Lucio Fulci: Maestros of Horror", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThere\u2019s never a bad time to watch a good horror movie. But the Halloween season gives just about everyone a good reason to binge on ghoulish films \u2014 and streaming video has lots of them. So this week\u2019s and next week\u2019s columns will deal with Halloween fare.Some of the films of Lucio Fulci (1927-1996), an Italian director known for his down-and-dirty gorefests, have a kind of narcotic fascination. Jean Rollin (1938-2010), the French director who mixed dreamy erotic imagery with spine-tingling morbidity and occasional Cocteau-inspired cinematic poetics, is another favorite.Both directors had their most productive periods in the \u201970s and \u201980s. Fulci\u2019s pictures were regular fare in New York grindhouses, where they could scandalize even their jaded audiences, while Rollin\u2019s reputation in the United States spread through home video.Fulci and Rollin\u2019s films were low-budget, awkwardly acted, and often had almost laughable gore and gross-out effects. (However, some scenes in Fulci\u2019s works featuring real parasites in action atop simulated rotting corpses make the maggot scene in Dario Argento\u2019s \u201cSuspiria\u201d look like a romp among fireflies.) Yet at their best they achieved the \u201cvenomous and intoxicating\u201d climate of \u201ctotal perdition\u201d that the critic Robert Benayoun called a requirement for \u201cauthentic sadistic cinema.\u201dA personal favorite is the 1978 film \u201cThe Grapes of Death\u201d (original French title: \u201cLes Raisins de la Mort\u201d). This can be seen as Rollin\u2019s gloss on the zombie pioneer George A. Romero, specifically his \u201cThe Crazies\u201d from 1973.In \u201cGrapes of Death,\u201d a young woman and her friend traveling by train in rural France are waylaid by staggering men with huge open sores on their faces and necks. One intriguing feature of the movie is that it\u2019s never precisely established what the afflicted homicidal shufflers really want, except to do horrific damage; they\u2019re not zombies and they don\u2019t feed on their victims.It\u2019s worth noting that Kanopy also offers several titles directed by the ineffable Italian horror maestro Mario Bava. Among them is \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d (1963), an anthology picture whose segment \u201cThe Wurdelak\u201d remains one of the most unsettlingly terrifying vampire tales ever committed to film.A nice group of ultra-icky pictures by Fulci is available on Screambox, including \u201cThe House by the Cemetery\u201d (1981) and \u201cCity of the Living Dead,\u201d from 1980, a.k.a. \u201cGates of Hell,\u201d which features a segment in which a character regurgitates her own intestines. This was the sort of thing that raised the eyebrows of the grindhouse regulars. As with many contemporary horror pictures, watching some of these makes you wonder, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this guy?\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with Rollin and Fulci, though, is probably a lot more interesting than what could be wrong with Eli Roth \u2014 which may in fact just be that he\u2019s watched too many Lucio Fulci movies \u2014 or the \u201cSaw\u201d people.Until recently, by the way, it was always a \u201cguy\u201d who had something wrong. But I\u2019m happy to report that a new crop of pretty twisted female horror directors is emerging, like Julia Ducournau, whose 2017 cannibal picture \u201cRaw\u201d is now streaming on demand from iTunes and other sites.Fulci himself addresses this question of derangement in \u201cA Cat in the Brain,\u201d also streaming on Screambox. In that 1990 movie, Fulci, playing himself, is compelled to visit a psychiatrist because he can\u2019t turn off the bizarre cinematic visions playing in his own head. In a twist typical of a Fulci movie \u2014 not to mention almost every other Italian serial-killer movie ever \u2014 the shrink \u2026 well, you\u2019ll see.Next week I\u2019ll be looking at some universally acknowledged classic horror titles streaming this season, and one or two new titles.Of classics, there are, in the cinematic firmament, a finite number. The thing about obscure and weird horror is that there\u2019s no practical end to it. As I file this piece I\u2019ll still have a watchlist of dozens more intriguing-sounding movies that seem to have come out of nowhere.As you explore for more, you never know what you\u2019ll find.On Amazon Prime I discovered a horror picture written and directed by a fellow I\u2019ve known since I was 10, and which features my high school Spanish teacher in a supporting role. It\u2019s called \u201cShe Wolf Rising,\u201d and also stars the scream queen Tiffany Shepis. As personally fascinating a find as it is, it\u2019ll have to be a Halloween story for another time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anthem Joins With CVS to Start Its Own Pharmacy Business", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe insurer is in the midst of a bitter legal battle with Express Scripts, its current pharmacy benefits manager, over claims that Anthem has been overcharged. The insurer said it will start the new business in 2020 after its contract with Express Scripts expires, estimating the savings from the new arrangement to be about $4 billion a year, the bulk of which it said would flow to customers in the form of lower drug costs.As pharmaceutical costs soar, pharmacy benefits managers, which serve as intermediaries between drug companies and the prescription plans, are coming under increasing criticism. The deals the managers strike with drug manufacturers are typically secret, making it hard to know what prices the companies are actually charging. The managers have come under fire for not doing enough to control costs.Joseph R. Swedish, Anthem\u2019s chief executive, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday, \u201cThis new partnership allows us to better secure control of the escalating cost\u201d of prescription drugs.The move also signals a potential shake-up in the industry among stand-alone pharmacy managers, now dominated by large companies like Express Scripts and CVS. Before Anthem\u2019s decision, UnitedHealth Group, another large insurer, already had its own benefits manager, OptumRX. There are also reports that Amazon, fresh from its acquisition of Whole Foods, is interested in entering the business by acquiring another rival and that would ramp up the competition.Anthem\u2019s decision is a significant blow to Express Scripts. The Anthem contract represents nearly a fifth of the company\u2019s revenues, and the decision by Anthem to start a rival business sets up more competition for its services.Anthem operates for-profit Blue Cross insurance plans to employers in several states, but it also offers managed care plans in government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Anthem executives said they planned to use the new company to expand its overall business, adding that they would offer the pharmacy benefit management services to other health plans and employers that are not Anthem customers.Describing the business model as overly complicated and lacking sufficient transparency, Mr. Swedish said the new company, called IngenioRx, \u201cwill resolve consumer frustration.\u201dIn explaining why Anthem, which had sold its pharmacy benefits business several years ago, decided to get back into the sector, Mr. Swedish said the industry \u201clandscape has radically changed.\u201d\u201dWe feel we need to pivot\u201d to better engage customers about their use of prescription drugs and to persuade employers that \u201cthey are getting the best price possible in a very dynamic pharmaceutical marketplace,\u201d he said.Anthem emphasized the new business will also be better able to manage the health of its existing insurance customers. By more closely monitoring its members\u2019 use of prescription drugs, Anthem says it can lower overall costs by making sure customers get the care they need and reducing expensive hospital admissions as a result.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harvey Weinstein Is the (Whispered) Talk of Hollywood", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Movie potentates were peppered across the Tower Bar here as usual on Friday night. Over in one dimly lit corner sat a martini-drinking movie star and his manager. And the restaurant\u2019s lively owner, Jeff Klein, worked the room as he normally does, pausing to schmooze here and shake an important hand there.At each banquette, as starlets of yesteryear gazed from their photographs on the walnut walls, he found himself in the same discussion. \u201cAll night long,\u201d Mr. Klein said, \u201cit seemed like there was only one topic: Harvey Weinstein. It\u2019s all anyone wanted to talk about.\u201dBut few in this spotlight-seeking town spoke publicly.Welcome to Hollywood, where people love to wag self-righteous fingers \u2014 over the past year, awards shows have become a platform for industry bigwigs to rail against the Trump administration \u2014 but run for cover whenever the topic casts show business in an unflattering light.From Thursday to Saturday, I called more than 40 entertainment industry players, and almost all refused to speak for the record. Some said it was because their companies (or publicists) needed to approve anything they would say, while others gave reasons that painted a picture of a community hobbled by fear, self-interest and hypocrisy. \u201cLadies of Hollywood,\u201d Rose McGowan, one of the actresses who settled with Mr. Weinstein, wrote on Twitter on Friday, \u201cyour silence is deafening.\u201dA publicist for an A-list actress said there was no \u201cupside\u201d for her client to comment, especially since she did not have a movie to promote. One producer wanted to know who else was on the record so he would be \u201cquoted in good company.\u201d An agent said he was repulsed by the silence and quoted a Latin phrase meaning, \u201cHe who sits quietly gives consent.\u201d Then he refused to talk.Of course, almost no one gets ahead in Hollywood by being a boy scout. In this image-conscious land, where publicists sometimes seem to outnumber people to publicize, the rule is to avoid being linked with controversy by any means necessary, lest you risk having your brand being tarnished or any of your own untoward behavior exposed.Not everyone has developed a sudden case of laryngitis.(Mr. Trump dismissed his comments as \u201clocker room talk,\u201d and Mr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly denied the accusations against them.)Many people online have noticed, in particular, conservatives.\u201cThoughts on Harvey Weinstein?\u201d Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Trump, asked Jimmy Kimmel on Twitter on Saturday. Mr. Kimmel, who has become an outspoken critic of the administration and, like most of his fellow late-night talk show hosts, had not yet said anything on the air about Mr. Weinstein, responded, \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting.\u201dThat led some fans to thank him. \u201cJimmy Kimmel and Seth Rogen thank you for addressing the Harvey Weinstein situation,\u201d wrote a Twitter user named Margaret. \u201cSilence from most celebrities is gross.\u201dSome people in Hollywood contend that Mr. Weinstein is different from Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Trump, because, to a degree, he fessed up.While the volcanic Mr. Weinstein is reviled \u2014 privately \u2014 by wide swaths of the entertainment industry, he also has a lot of friends. One producer who has worked repeatedly with Mr. Weinstein said that he wasn\u2019t speaking out because \u201cI happen to think the world of the guy.\u201dMr. Weinstein made a lot of careers, starting at Miramax in the 1990s and then at the Weinstein Company, which was founded in 2005. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck might not be stars without \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d released by Miramax in 1997. Quentin Tarantino can credit Mr. Weinstein with getting \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cKill Bill\u201d into theaters. Gwyneth Paltrow thanked Mr. Weinstein and Miramax for \u201ctheir undying support of me,\u201d when she accepted the best actress trophy for \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d at the 1999 Academy Awards.But silence works both ways, Ms. Eller pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s striking that nobody has come to Harvey\u2019s defense, either,\u201d she said.Especially considering that Mr. Weinstein has tried to rally support. According to two people briefed on the matter, who naturally spoke on the condition of anonymity, he reached out to top agents at William Morris Endeavor and Creative Artists Agency and asked them to sign a letter of support and release it publicly.They said no.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Key Evidence in Chelsea Bombing Trial: Articles on Building Bombs", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe magazine photograph shows a red chair, the kind arranged in pedestrian zones all over Times Square, this one on Seventh Avenue. There is a yellow cab in the background, driving past a TGI Fridays and a billboard for \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d On the chair sits a single item, a colorful child\u2019s backpack.The photograph appears beside an article titled \u201cMake a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,\u201d which offers step-by-step instructions for doing just that, from cutting the heads off matches to how to best pack shrapnel into a pressure cooker.The online articles shown in court looked professional, with the sort of layouts and photography associated with mainstream media. Charts, timelines and maps appeared alongside Q. and A. interviews with people with names like \u201cChef AQ,\u201d a kitchen bomb maker. The bomb article includes safety tips like \u201cWear gloves.\u201d On top of that list is Rule 1: \u201cPut your trust in Allah and pray for the success of your operation. This is the most important rule.\u201dThe articles were found in a computer seized at Mr. Rahimi\u2019s home on Sept. 19, 2016, two days after a bomb exploded on West 23rd Street in Chelsea, wounding more than 30 people, blowing out windows and crumpling a Dumpster. A second device was found four blocks away shortly afterward, a pressure cooker with wires protruding from the top. That morning, a pipe bomb had exploded at the finish line of a charity race in Seaside Park, N.J. Mr. Rahimi\u2019s fingerprints and his appearance on video cameras in the areas of the bombings led the authorities to him and his home.An investigator for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan testified of the search of the laptop and Mr. Rahimi\u2019s phone, finding articles about \u201cThe Hidden Bomb\u201d and \u201cOpen Source jihad,\u201d a guide to making weapons with everyday materials and, its summary explains, \u201ca resource manual for those who loathe the tyrants.\u201d It was accompanied by a picture of a man kneeling in prayer over a pressure cooker.The \u201cKitchen of Your Mom\u201d article includes instructions and photographs of the supplies, including an iron pipe, black powder, match heads and a Christmas light. Mr. Rahimi\u2019s defense lawyers, in a cross-examination on Tuesday, asked whether it was possible that someone who studied Al Qaeda and similar groups and their causes could simply be a \u201cfan boy.\u201dAt some point, Mr. Rahimi went shopping, both online and on foot, seemingly with the materials from the articles in mind.Using data like the computer\u2019s I.P. address and what the police identified as Mr. Rahimi\u2019s email address, investigators linked the defendant to several Amazon purchases for materials used in homemade bombs. On July 2, 2016, two months before the bombing, Amazon shipped one order: \u201c8,000 Pack of Precision Quality Galvanized Steel BBs. Super Value!\u201d The police seized those BBs, and jurors passed the heavy jar among themselves when it was admitted as evidence on Tuesday.Investigators also traced Mr. Rahimi to a Home Depot store in New Jersey, where he spent almost three hours one day roaming the aisles. Prosecutors entered into evidence black tape attached to a flip cellphone, galvanized pipe, duct tape and wire found at the site of the explosion in Seaside Park. An F.B.I. agent testified that investigators found something else there, familiar to readers of Inspire: a Christmas light.Also testifying on Tuesday were officials from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, where security footage showed Mr. Rahimi walking through the train terminal dragging two rolling suitcases, and officials from adjoining Madison Square Garden, where similar videos were discovered. Mr. Rahimi made his way down to West 23rd Street, prosecutors said, with two suitcases, and he sat on a church\u2019s steps for about 20 minutes as people walked past on a warm Saturday night. He left one suitcase behind, then brought the other to West 27th Street, leaving it there.Much of the testimony over two days has involved camera footage, bomb materials and damage and injury, but on Tuesday, jurors heard briefly from someone who once called Mr. Rahimi a friend. It was not a defense witness, but the prosecution\u2019s, Younus Rahimi, a co-worker of Mr. Rahimi\u2019s at a Kennedy Fried Chicken outlet in Perth Amboy, N.J. He was asked to describe buying a cellphone from Mr. Rahimi in August 2016, a month before the bombing.\u201cHe said he needed some money,\u201d said Younus Rahimi, who is not related to the defendant.On cross-examination, a defense lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, found an opportunity to try to make the co-worker into a character witness of sorts.\u201cYou knew Ahmad to be just another guy who worked there, correct?\u201d she asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Younus Rahimi replied.\u201cJust like you?\u201d she asked.\u201cYes,\u201d he replied.Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weinstein, Hefner and the Poor Excuse That Explains a Lot", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe one thing I\u2019m certain of \u2014 it\u2019s just sex,\u201d Paul says. \u201cIf you stand back and think about what we all look like chasing each other, you\u2019d have to laugh, right?\u201dOr maybe cry. The moral squalor of the sex business is evident everywhere on the show \u2014 the prostitutes opportunistically herded into police wagons, beaten up or sliced by pimps and underpaid for their work, if they\u2019re paid at all.The show\u2019s first season ends Sunday on HBO. It takes about five episodes to get wherever it\u2019s going. (The folks who made \u201cThe Wire\u201d made this. So \u201cstand back and think\u201d is a creative philosophy.) But what it\u2019s taking apart are industries built on the exploitation of women. Officially, those industries are prostitution and the arrival of mass-market movie pornography. But the show\u2019s scuzzy tableau could easily stand in for gender dynamics in Hollywood or various areas of the American workplace, where part of securing or keeping a job might require enduring the sort of serial predation we\u2019ve been hearing about in the last year in the accusations against Bill Cosby, Bill O\u2019Reilly, the film producer Harvey Weinstein and the writer and director James Toback.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s social diagnosis successfully invoked the era that we had just memorialized after Hugh Hefner died. Mr. Hefner invented the Playboy ethos that Mr. Weinstein used like a get-out-of-jail-free card. \u201cThe culture then\u201d encouraged men to loosen their libidos and women were expected to tolerate it. Playboy operated with a patina of civility that granted the average man a presumption of pleasure that went one way \u2014 his. And that permission flourished in the psyches of all kinds of men.In the wake of the Weinstein news, as more women detail unwanted encounters with colleagues and bosses, we\u2019re seeing how common it was for men, indeed, to help themselves. We\u2019re seeing how the personal Playboy fantasy, benign as it might have looked, could spread into the workplace.The Playboy doctrine would mutate into the darker, more explicit realm that is spooling out on \u201cThe Deuce.\u201d Pornography gave us a framework for understanding sex as both an act and a state of mind that was similar to Hollywood\u2019s imposition of ideas about romance.The culture now seems eager to challenge some of those values \u2014 or at least to restage, unpack and reckon with, in Mr. Weinstein\u2019s words, \u201cthe culture then.\u201d The journalistic depiction of prostitution and a burgeoning porn cinema on \u201cThe Deuce\u201d is grim and queasy and morally suspenseful. Not even the wiliest, most enterprising female characters fare well. But the show\u2019s most exhilarating moments are on the faces of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dominique Fishback, as they come alive with plans of self-determination, of power-sharing. But it feels as if it might take forever for their dreams to come true.But I went home happy, anyway. That\u2019s because the movie takes a rollicking, triumphal approach to the feminism of its day. (It was also known as \u201cwomen\u2019s lib\u201d back then.) The men sit around in locker rooms and lounges grinning and grunting and slurping beer. Howard Cosell says about Ms. King, \u201cShould she ever let her hair grow down to her shoulders, took her glasses off, you\u2019d have somebody vying for a Hollywood screen test.\u201dThis is to say that the Playboy-era myths are hard to shake. \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d and \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d especially, show how resistant we are to real equality. One dead pimp on \u201cThe Deuce\u201d doesn\u2019t end male-controlled prostitution. Systemic inequity is harder to kill. So is the misogyny that fuels it.Still, the persistence of all this combat can leave you weary. That accounts for the mixed emotions of my night at \u201cBattle of the Sexes.\u201d This is a movie about a tennis match that really happened, yet it feels like a fable. When Billie Jean King, who\u2019s played by Emma Stone, wins the first set, cheers broke out in the theater. Actual cheers. I turned around to see who clapped, and one section was filled with women who seemed old enough to remember seeing the match. Celebrating it felt good; it felt just.It also felt dismayingly recurrent. The movie is called \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d but only because somebody already took \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d And Ms. King is very much a civil rights legend. But, here, she\u2019s also Sisyphus.So what now? If the entitlements of the Playboy era have suffused our lunch breaks and boardroom meetings and subway rides home, and porn has evolved into something elemental, like fire and water, how do we prevent their personal encroachments and abuses, along with every other important but less salacious imbalance, like for instance, with salaries? How do we reconcile all the complications? \u201cResist\u201d is one thing. \u201cChange\u201d is something else. Beyonc\u00e9 is sending that solidarity cry out for ladies. But to get anything meaningful done, more than a few good men are going to have to answer it, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would You Like My Car to Make You Some Water?", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsA few years ago, Doug Martin, an engineer at Ford, read an article about an unusual billboard in Lima, Peru: It was designed to collect and filter water that condenses on the billboard\u2019s cool surfaces when humid air rolls in from the coast.A short time later, a thought occurred to him: Why couldn\u2019t a car produce drinking water, too? Air-conditioners in cars do something similar to the Peruvian billboard \u2014 generating water by removing moisture from the air. Then he and a Ford colleague, John Rollinger, went about developing a system that dispenses that moisture as cool and filtered drinking water to people inside the vehicle.Now Mr. Martin and Mr. Rollinger are working to turn their system into commercial technology.\u201cThere are people in a lot of locations who don\u2019t have easy access to fresh water \u2014 arid regions, remote regions,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cBut even in a market like the U.S., this might be a feature for people who want to have extremely pure, clean water and don\u2019t want water bottles filling up the landfill.\u201dThe drinking-water idea points to a wider change rippling through the global auto industry: As cars gain more computing power and adopt new technologies, engineers are finding ways to make cars do much more than take us from Point A to Point B.These days, some cars can serve as Wi-Fi hot spots, backup power generators or remote controls for your home. In the future, they might also monitor your health; seat suppliers are tinkering with sensors that can monitor a driver\u2019s heart rate and body temperature.Karl Brauer, a senior director at Kelley Blue Book, the automotive research company, said cars were on a path that resembled the one taken by the iPhone.\u201cWhen the iPhone came out 10 years ago, you could make phone calls and text and access the internet, but no one knew how far it would go with apps,\u201d he said. \u201cCars are going the same way. They are going to serve us in ways and are going to be able to do things that we haven\u2019t even conceived of yet.\u201dMyriad technologies are reshaping what automobiles can do. Most new car are already loaded with computer chips and have wireless communications links, and they are gaining more abilities in those areas every year. Underneath the sheet metal, new cars also usually have fewer mechanical devices and more electronic components than earlier models, a change that allows for advances simply by changing software.All of this is allowing auto engineers to expand their imaginations.That was the case at Ford. After dreaming up his drinking-water idea, Mr. Martin hesitated before entering it into an internal innovation competition. \u201cI thought: This is crazy. I hope nobody laughs at me,\u201d he recalled.But eventually he and Mr. Rollinger ran out to Home Depot and spent about $100 on hoses, tubing and plumbing fittings. They grabbed a standard automotive pump and a water filter, and commandeered a rectangular baking pan from Mr. Martin\u2019s kitchen.\u201cThis was really fun,\u201d Mr. Rollinger said. \u201cIt was like doing a science project in school.\u201dThey devised a way to collect water droplets from an air-conditioner\u2019s condensing coils. Normally that water drains onto the road beneath the car. In their system, the water is run through a filter and then stored in a reservoir.Turn a switch inside the car, and a pump sends water from the reservoir up and out a spout mounted near the front console. The water arrives chilled because it condensed on the cool surfaces of the air-conditioner coils, Mr. Rollinger said.The pair entered the prototype they built into Ford\u2019s innovation contest last year, and it was selected as one of the winners. They have also applied for a patent.For now, they are talking to suppliers and working on the business case for the idea. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful of seeing it go into production,\u201d Mr. Rollinger said.Here\u2019s a look at some other features that cars are starting to offer.\u201cThe kids have tablet and they watch videos on YouTube on all kinds of things,\u201d said Dr. Chandler, an orthopedic surgeon in Greensboro, N.C. \u201cThat keeps them pretty occupied.\u201dSometimes his wife, a pediatrician, connects to the internet to finish up medical reports. \u201cIf we leave on a Friday afternoon, she can bring her laptop and get her work done before,\u201d he said.Several other automakers also offer in-car Wi-Fi and internet connections. For the manufacturers, they are easy add-ons because most modern cars need communication abilities for their navigation systems. General Motors, for example, offers a high-speed 4G link, and many models come with a free three-month trial.\u201cYou have so much electricity production from hydrogen fuel cells that you could use it to power a field hospital, or power tools and provide power relief in a natural disaster,\u201d said Charles Freese, executive director of G.M.\u2019s Global Fuel Cell Business.Advertisement"}

The charming accents are just a bonus. See all the titles in this collection on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.This new iteration was created and written by Patrick Harbinson, who has extensive experience in the more caffeinated American versions of these stories as a writer and producer on \u201cHomeland\u201d and \u201c24.\u201d His primary innovation is to make the characters doing the dirty work women. Emma Banville (Helen McCrory), a crusading lawyer, uncovers what appears, in the three episodes available for review, to be a cover-up involving a murder and an American air base. She\u2019s opposed by American (Robin Weigert of \u201cDeadwood\u201d) and British (Wunmi Mosaku) operatives who carry out their orders with varying degrees of enthusiasm.In trying to construct the layered plot a conspiracy tale requires, Mr. Harbinson piles on complications but doesn\u2019t really find a hook to pull us into the story. Emma, who\u2019s sheltering the wife of a British citizen suspected of terrorism, is already being watched by the British spy services when the series begins. Then she takes on the wrongful-conviction case of a man in prison for the murder of a teenage girl.This results in Emma and her very patient boyfriend having two houseguests who are both persons of interest to the government, a situation that serves a dramatic purpose but mostly just feels contrived. It doesn\u2019t help the story\u2019s believability that, in order to reinforce Emma\u2019s fearlessness on behalf of her clients, Mr. Harbinson exaggerates both the hatred she inspires (from the dead girl\u2019s family) and the malevolence of the government\u2019s opposition to levels that are excessive even for a paranoid thriller.If your appetite for dark tales of official malfeasance is strong, \u201cFearless\u201d will go down easily enough, helped by the usual superior British cast \u2014 Jamie Bamber (\u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d) pops up as a shifty member of Parliament and Michael Gambon drifts in and out as the master of the universe who\u2019s guilty of something that will presumably be revealed in Episode 6. If six hours is a tough ask, though, go straight to \u201cState of Play.\u201dAn earlier version of this review listed a premiere date of Oct. 27 based on information provided by the show\u2019s publicist at the time.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Latest Way Into Your Life Is Through the Front Door", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 For many online shoppers, packages often linger for distressingly long hours outside their homes, where they can be stolen or soaked by rain. Now, if customers give it permission, Amazon\u2019s couriers will unlock the front doors and drop packages inside when no one is home.What could possibly go wrong?The head spins with the opportunities for mischief in letting a stranger into an empty home. There are risks for couriers too \u2014 whether it\u2019s an attacking dog or an escaping cat. To allay these concerns, Amazon is asking customers to trust it \u2014 buy a package of technology including an internet-connected smart lock and an indoor security camera.Amazon isn\u2019t the only business that believes this is the future of internet shopping, as well as other services that require home access, like dog walking and house keeping. This summer, a start-up that makes smart locks, Latch, struck a deal with Jet.com, an online shopping site owned by Walmart, to jointly pay for the installation of its locks on 1,000 apartment buildings in New York City to make deliveries easier. The arrangement offers some of the security of a doorman for people who live in buildings without them.The costs of package theft aren\u2019t known \u2014 Amazon, for example, will not say \u2014 but are probably substantial. Most people who have spent any time on a neighborhood blog, social network or email list have a sense of how prevalent such crime is. And packages sitting on front porches can also signal to anyone who walks by that the homeowners are away.Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who specializes in legal issues related to technology, said Amazon\u2019s new service relies on the same kind of trust homeowners commonly extend to services to which they hand over their keys. But he said those agreements often involve in-person interactions, which won\u2019t happen when homeowners allow Amazon to unlock its doors.\u201cIt raises questions about how do you specify and police expectations when the relationship is one mediated almost entirely by technology?\u201d Mr. Calo said.Amazon\u2019s new service, Amazon Key, will require customers to buy a kit that starts at $250 and includes a security camera made by the company and a smart door lock made by Yale or Kwikset. When a delivery comes to a customer\u2019s door, the lock first helps Amazon verify that the driver is at the correct address at the appropriate time. It then starts recording video and unlocks the door, capturing the entire visit.\u201cCustomers told us they really want to understand and see what\u2019s happening when deliveries are happening,\u201d said Charlie Tritschler, vice president for Amazon devices. \u201cIt gives them assurance.\u201dAmazon is also offering the camera, called Amazon Cloud Cam, as a stand-alone product for $120, significantly less than other internet-connected cameras.Amazon says it will guarantee protection for customers in the event a driver damages or steals something inside a home. It suggests homeowners keep pets away from front doors when deliveries are expected. If drivers can\u2019t safely make deliveries, they\u2019ll leave packages outside.The company said Amazon Key will be available in 37 cities in the United States starting Nov. 8 and open to its Prime members, who pay $99 a year for fast shipping and other benefits. The system can also be used to grant home access to other services, such as Merry Maids, a housecleaning provider, and Rover.com, a dog-walking site.Luke Schoenfelder, the chief executive and co-founder of Latch, the start-up working with Jet.com, said it has initially focused on installing smart locks on the front doors of apartment buildings to allow deliveries to building lobbies, rather than inside the apartments themselves. Allowing couriers inside apartments has more risks, but Latch plans to eventually do that as well.\u201cIt certainly has a lot more challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cPets are the biggest one.\u201dStill, he predicted that the strangeness of allowing companies like Latch and Amazon to unlock front doors will go away as customers get more accustomed to the services, in the same way they got more comfortable stepping into a stranger\u2019s car they had summoned with Uber or Lyft.\u201cThe world is absolutely going there,\u201d Mr. Schoenfelder said.Advertisement"}

Its villain, Wolf Larsen, captain of the rogue vessel Ghost, was the product, as well as the victim, of a heartless economic system. Robinson\u2019s surly, scenery-devouring swagger turns Larsen into a sadistic dictator inspired by his readings of Nietzsche. His philosophy is encapsulated in a motto lifted from Milton: \u201cBetter to reign in hell than serve in heaven.\u201dRobinson, who became a star portraying gangsters, is as hard a hard guy as he\u2019s ever been; the vessel he commands is less a pirate ship than a floating concentration camp. When Humphrey van Weyden (Alexander Knox), a sensitive writer and London\u2019s stand-in, comes aboard after being rescued from a shipwreck, he finds the first mate in his death throes being studiously ignored by Larsen\u2019s crew.Van Weyden is the novel\u2019s hero but Rossen also built up parts for two working-class characters who eventually fall for each other. An embittered drifter, George Leach (Garfield), and a hard-boiled prostitute, Ruth Brewster (Lupino), separately elude the police to wind up on the Ghost. Lupino is mercurial and assertive, her volatility matched by Garfield\u2019s. Indeed, the anger that they and Robinson bring to their roles bespeaks a larger issue: the war going on in Europe.In the film, Bruce Ismay (E. F. F\u00fcrbringer), the British magnate whose company owned the Titanic, ignores the advice of his fictional German first officer (Hans Nielsen). Striving to maximize his profits, Ismay, in effect, sinks his ship, filled with British and American plutocrats who are served by a heroic crew.After 45 minutes of talky intrigue and betrayal, a tiny iceberg is visible in the blackness. As the engine room floods, children are abandoned, marriages break up, false information is disseminated, and rioting erupts. Some images were incorporated in the 1958 British feature about the 1912 disaster, \u201cA Night to Remember.\u201d \u201cTitanic\u201d ends with a hearing in which Ismay is acquitted, the injustice underscored by a statement describing the movie as a condemnation of \u201cEngland\u2019s eternal quest for profit.\u201d\u201cTitanic,\u201d which was filmed in German-occupied Gdynia in Poland, as systematic gassing was beginning in Auschwitz and the Soviets were launching a counteroffensive against the Nazis at Stalingrad, not only evokes a catastrophe but was one. Heard complaining about the government, the initial director, Herbert Selpin, was arrested midway through the production, and was found hanging in his prison cell. Then the scenes of mass panic seemed to hit too close to home for a German population coming under Allied siege. The movie was extensively cut and was banned in Germany in 1944, although it does seem to have been released in occupied France and was shown in West Germany after the war.Advertisement"}

Traditional retail businesses have been in decline for a long time; the cult of shared goods and services enabled by technology is ever ascendant.The first iteration of Lord & Taylor was a dry goods store on Catherine Street in Lower Manhattan that opened in 1826. The 676,000-square-foot Italianate building in Midtown it eventually occupied in 1914 (a building for which WeWork is now paying $850 million) stood not merely as a monument to turn-of-the-century commerce but also as the grand testament to what the sociologist Thorstein Veblen called the rising culture of \u201cconspicuous leisure.\u201dLeisure, Veblen wrote, \u201cdoes not connote indolence or quiescence.\u2019\u2019 What it conveys is the \u201cnonproductive consumption of time,\u201d by which he was not anticipating the 10,000 hours people would fritter away playing Minecraft, but any time spent away from the activity of labor. In their infancy and well into the first 80 years or so of the 20th century, department stores were largely places to pass the hours. When Lord & Taylor opened on Fifth Avenue and 38th Street it featured three dining rooms, a manicure parlor for men and a mechanical horse that could walk, trot or canter. Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges in London, dictated that \u201ca store should be a social center.\u201d To that end he installed an ice rink and shooting range on the roof of his store and exhibited the first plane to fly over the English Channel.Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or \u201cproductive\u201d lives. At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes. We can spend $53 or $8,500. There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances, came to look like leisure, which is why WeWork\u2019s purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious. WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies, giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.\u201cWeWork\u2019s mission is to help people make a life, not just a living,\u2019\u2019 as one of its executives recently explained in a news release. The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted. You are always working \u2014 posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line \u2014 and you are always living.You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience. There are events all the time. Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity. The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog. There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.Although the mourners are unlikely to be comforted, Lord & Taylor will not disappear entirely from New York\u2019s streetscape; the famous Christmas windows should survive. Lord & Taylor will rent a quarter of the building, maintaining a smaller version of itself. WeWork will take over the rest for its headquarters and the leasing of shared office space \u2014 and tutorials perhaps for what is supposed to count now as a good time.Advertisement"}

Or were we shirking our civic duty?For a nation settled by convicts, Australians can be sticklers for the rules. I think of this every time I see people waiting for the \u201cwalk\u201d sign at crosswalks where cars are nowhere to be seen, or when I interact with officials in Canberra or civil servants in New South Wales, who tend to insist that the way they do things is the only way they could ever be done, ever, anywhere.But here\u2019s the challenge that rule-following Australia now finds itself confronting: What\u2019s to be done with those who have a different experience, say in countries where rules are more negotiable, or those who simply want a less rigid society and more, well, encouragement of difference?Our ethical conundrum was relatively minor (kangaroos have survived far worse than white bread), but there are bigger issues afoot that are testing Australia\u2019s sense of when to hold the line and when to live and let live.With same-sex marriage, for example, Australians are deciding whether the old rules of relationships should still be enforced, or loosened. The debate isn\u2019t just about competing arguments of freedom or fairness, or about what the word marriage should really mean; it\u2019s also about whether or not to change how Australians interact with each other.That question affects immigration too. The elevation of rules restricting access drives the refugee policy that led to the detention centers on Manus and Nauru. It\u2019s also what lets the country\u2019s leaders pat each other on the back for Australia\u2019s \u201cmulticultural society\u201d even as they work to add additional rules that make it harder to obtain citizenship, and insist that immigrants exhibit \u201cAustralian values,\u201d which mean just about anything that the establishment deems important.Indeed, I\u2019m often struck by the gap between white Australians who insist everyone is welcomed in Australia \u2014 no hyphenated identities here! \u2014 and the experience of immigrants or the children of immigrants who tell me the many ways they are treated as \u201cother\u201d and made to feel that their differences are unwelcome.This is hardly unique to Australia; immigrants and expanding ideas of sexuality and gender are challenging societal norms all over the world. And yet what\u2019s so interesting about the current moment in Australia are the ways that these forces \u2014 those defending the status quo, and challenging it \u2014 are colliding.Where, I often wonder, will Australia be in five or 10 years on its adherence to rules, and on these issues of sexuality and gender, and race and immigration?At our cottages, my daughter found her own middle ground. When offered a slice of bread to feed the kangaroos, she declined, but without comment. She did not defend the rules to those who may not have seen the signs (they had walked in from another area), nor did she violate the rules herself.Maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s something to be learned in that?What examples do you see in your own lives, or what ethical quandaries have you faced, that might help explain where Australia is heading?Now, here are our favorite stories from the past week, about Australia and not, followed by a recommendation.______The mass shooting in Las Vegas has once again brought tears, outrage and debates about American gun culture into our daily lives.______Hailing from Sydney, could they be \u201dthe greatest trio on earth?\u201d____________The segments are short, just a few minutes each, and will inject a touch of inspiration into your routine.\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to start the day,\u201d Bella says, \u201cto arrive at work seeing the good in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Application Website Went Down as Deadline Looms", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor thousands of students anxiously trying to apply to colleges, it must have felt like disaster: Just before midnight on Monday, with barely 48 hours to go before the early deadline at many colleges, the web portal used by more than a million students a year started balking, and then shut down completely.The Common Application, the nonprofit organization that runs the web portal, posted on Twitter Monday night that, because of \u201ctechnical difficulties,\u201d it was taking the application system off line for two hours to make repairs.Many students, admissions officers, guidance counselors and teachers reacted to the shutdown with snark and a strong dose of gallows humor. Many of them postponed their bedtimes.Were Russian hackers to blame? That was a popular joke among admissions officers, according to Jim Rawlins, director of admissions at the University of Oregon. \u201cEither the Russians, or one of their competitors that\u2019s just jealous of them,\u201d Mr. Rawlins said on Tuesday.University officials were taking the problem seriously, he said, but \u201con the other hand, we figure if we can laugh with them, it will reduce the stress\u201d for prospective students.Applicants were not shy about venting in response to the Common App outage. \u201cScariest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me on Halloween,\u201d wrote one Twitter follower named Michelle.Another person, using the handle Lost Hussein, was so outraged by the evident failure of digital technology in a supremely digital age that only capital letters would do: \u201cDoes AMAZON Shut Down Hours Before Christmas? Does it Crash?\u201dJennifer Dart, a spokeswoman for the Common App, said on Tuesday that the portal ran into trouble because of \u201cunusually large and intermittent spikes in system activity.\u201d She offered an apology to all those affected, saying that \u201cthe last thing we want is to add any more stress\u201d to the college application process.According to the Common App Twitter feed, the portal was down from 11:30 p.m. Eastern time Monday until 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. Some users, however, said problems persisted after that time.Ms. Dart said the site uses Amazon Web Services to allow it to handle high volumes of traffic when needed, but \u201cwhat we experienced yesterday was not a server capacity issue.\u201dMonday night was not the first time the Common App portal has had problems. Technical snags left students struggling to send in applications in the autumn of 2013, and in response, some universities delayed their early submission deadlines.Ms. Dart said she was not aware of any college extending its Nov. 1 deadline this year. To make the deadline, an application must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday in the applicant\u2019s local time zone.Over all, Ms. Dart said, about 104,200 applications and more than 700,000 recommendations were submitted in the 24 hours through midday Tuesday, comparable with the same period a year earlier. Just under half of all first-year applicants last year applied early, she said, though Nov. 1 is not the early deadline at every college. The regular application deadline is generally in January.Kent Rinehart, dean of admissions at Marist College, said that along with the Common App web outage, there have been delays in sending high school transcripts through Naviance, a system used by high school guidance counselors. The problems did not appear to be related.Naviance said in a statement that it was working on the issue.\u201cThe worry is that we haven\u2019t even reached the peak of activity,\u201d Mr. Rinehart said on Tuesday. \u201cThat peak will likely be tomorrow.\u201dThe Common App is meant to streamline the college admission process by allowing students to fill out one standard application and submit it to many schools, though some of the more than 700 colleges and universities that accept the Common App also require students to submit an additional essay or other material.Animated GIFs were a popular way to convey on social media how it felt to be unable to apply while the web portal was down: the scream, the tear, the faint, the overweight basketball player flopping on his belly as he attempted a shot.In a more conciliatory spirit, a student named Kenna offered a confession and an affirmation: \u201cI believe in you Common App. It\u2019s O.K. to be the scapegoat of students who didn\u2019t start earlier, and I didn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Rawlins of the University of Oregon said that students should try not to worry too much. \u201cThere\u2019s so much hype around getting this done, it\u2019s understandable there would be stress,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re in a different time zone, we\u2019re going to err toward midnight on their side. We don\u2019t care about the seconds, just in case you\u2019re curious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is the sort of story the tech industry loves to tell about itself: It is bringing freedom, enlightenment and a better future for all mankind.Their amount of concentrated authority resembles the divine right of kings, and is sparking a backlash that is still gathering force.\u201cFor 10 years, the arguments in tech were about which chief executive was more like Jesus. Which one was going to run for president. Who did the best job convincing the work force to lean in,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cNow sentiments are shifting. The worm has turned.\u201dUnderlying the meet-and-greets is the reality that the internet long ago became a business, which means the companies\u2019 first imperative is to do right by their stockholders.\u201cFor all the lip service that Silicon Valley has given to changing the world, its ultimate focus has been on what it can monetize,\u201d Mr. Baird said.\u201cThe result?\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery voice is heard. The cacophony more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harassment and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen.\u201dSuch complaints, repeated at regular intervals, did not stop the tech world from seizing the moment. Millions and then billions of people flocked to its services. The chief executives were regarded as sages. Disruption was the highest good.Mr. Rosenstein, a co-founder of Asana, an office productivity start-up, said in an email that he had banned not just Facebook but also the Safari and Chrome browsers, Gmail and other applications.\u201cI realized that I spend a lot of time mindlessly interacting with my phone in ways that aren\u2019t serving me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook is a very powerful tool that I continue to use every day, just with more mindfulness.\u201dIf social media is on the defensive, Mr. Zuckerberg is particularly on the spot \u2014 a rare event in a golden career that has made him, at 33, one of the richest and most influential people on the planet.\u201cWe have a saying: \u2018Move fast and break things,\u2019\u201d he wrote in his 2012 manifesto. \u201cThe idea is that if you never break anything, you\u2019re probably not moving fast enough.\u201dFacebook dropped that motto two years later, but critics say too much of the implicit arrogance has lingered. Mr. Galloway, whose new book, \u201cThe Four,\u201d analyzes the power of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, said the social media network was still fumbling its response.\u201cZuckerberg and Facebook are violating the No. 1 rule of crisis management: Overcorrect for the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir attitude is that anything that damages their profits is impossible for them to do.\u201dJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, said the network was doing its best.\u201cFacebook is an important part of many people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous responsibility \u2014 and one that we take incredibly seriously.\u201dSome social media entrepreneurs acknowledge that they are confronting issues they never imagined as employees of start-ups struggling to survive.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to think through the repercussions of everything we did,\u201d Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, said in an interview shortly before he rejoined the service last spring.He maintained that Twitter was getting an unfair rap: \u201cFor every bad thing, there are a thousand good things.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that sometimes \u201cit gets a little messy.\u201dDespite the swell of criticism, the vast majority of investors, consumers and regulators seem not to have changed their behavior. People still eagerly await the new iPhone. Facebook has more than two billion users. President Trump likes to criticize Amazon on Twitter, but his administration ignored pleas for a rigorous examination of Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods.\u201cThis war, like so many wars, is going to start in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor.For some tech companies, the new power is a heavy weight. Cloudflare, which provides many sites with essential protection from hacking, made its first editorial decision in August: It lifted its protection from The Daily Stormer, basically expunging the neo-Nazi site from the visible web.\u201cIncreasingly tech companies are going to be put into the position of making these sorts of judgments,\u201d said Matthew Prince, Cloudflare\u2019s chief executive.The picture is likely to get even more complicated. Mr. Prince foresees several possible dystopian futures. One is where every search engine has a political point of view, and users gravitate toward the one they feel most comfortable with. That would further balkanize the internet.Another possibility is the opposite extreme: Under the pressure of regulation, all hate speech \u2014 and eventually all dissent \u2014 is filtered out.\u201cPeople are realizing that technology isn\u2019t neutral,\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cI used to travel to Europe to hear these fears.

{"Headline": "Sheryl Sandberg Blitzes Washington in P.R. Push for Facebook", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For months, Facebook has been trying to counter criticism about its influence on the 2016 presidential election. The company has hired three crisis communications firms and has bought digital and newspaper ads. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has posted live video to the social network to explain how much he cared about election integrity.This week, it sent Sheryl Sandberg to Washington to charm Congress and the public.Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, acted as the giant tech company\u2019s chief ambassador in the capital on Wednesday and Thursday \u2014 shuttling around to talk with dozens of lawmakers, and making numerous promises about how the company would change.In a public appearance hosted by Axios, the news start-up, she admitted that Facebook had made mistakes during the presidential campaign. She offered lawmakers who are investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the election more data from the company. And she promised the Congressional Black Caucus that she would help appoint an African-American to the Facebook board.\u201cShe said 10 to 15 times, \u2018We\u2019ve got to do better,\u2019\u201d Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democrat from Missouri, said after Ms. Sandberg met with the Congressional Black Caucus, which has complained about the level of diversity at the company.In addition to the new crisis communications firms, the company has placed ads in places like The New York Times and The Washington Post. But it has been difficult to quell the concerns of lawmakers, and Ms. Sandberg\u2019s meetings this week were focused on fixing various problems facing the company.Ms. Sandberg, 48, knows her way in Washington, having worked here for years as a top aide in the Treasury Department. She is now regularly mentioned as a potential political candidate. That speculation increased in 2013 after the release of her first book, \u201cLean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.\u201d She was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and is a top Democratic donor.She has tried to deflect rumors about running for office, but they persist, and her appearance in Washington this week is unlikely to quell them. At her only public event in Washington, she gave smooth and measured answers to questions from Mike Allen, a co-founder of Axios, the online news start-up that hosted the event. The performance stood in stark contrast to efforts from Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, who usually appears far less comfortable in such situations \u2014 and who has also been mentioned as a potential political candidate.With House Intelligence Committee leaders who are investigating the company\u2019s role in foreign meddling in the election, Ms. Sandberg agreed to hand over a broader set of data linked to fake Russian accounts and to give more information about how that data was targeted to users. With top Republican and Democratic leaders of the House, she emphasized the company\u2019s desire to help with the investigation and promoted its plan to hire thousands of people to review ad purchases so the mistakes of the 2016 election are prevented from happening again.\u201cThey are leaning in on this issue,\u201d said Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation, alluding to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s book.\u201cThey have launched a platform that communicates around the world,\u201d Mr. Conaway said, \u201cand it\u2019s important for us to understand their perspective.\u201dIn a one-hour meeting Thursday with at least 17 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Ms. Sandberg delivered the same message and a peace offering.Ms. Sandberg responded with personal reflections. She said she was disappointed that Facebook ads had been used to sow racial division during the election, according to the caucus chairman, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, a Democrat from Louisiana. She told the caucus that she prayed daily that Facebook hadn\u2019t contributed to the outcome of the election, according to Representative G. K. Butterfield, a Democrat from North Carolina. And she promised that Facebook would appoint an African-American member to its board in the near future.\u201cI remain cautiously optimistic,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said after the meeting.When asked to comment on her day, Ms. Sandberg waved her hands and said: \u201cSorry, we\u2019re not talking. I need time for myself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U., Citing Amazon and Apple, Tells Nations to Collect Tax", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European competition regulators on Wednesday mounted a push against tax avoidance by Silicon Valley giants, announcing plans to take Ireland to court for failing to collect back taxes from Apple and ordering Luxembourg to claim unpaid taxes from Amazon.Officials in Europe have been particularly focused on flexing their regulatory muscles against American technology companies, including assessing penalties for antitrust violations and opening investigations into the mishandling of customer data.Critics have argued that the measures show that the European Union is unfairly targeting such companies \u2014 an accusation that officials in Europe deny.The moves to address tax avoidance have special resonance in the region, much of which has endured painful austerity measures stemming from the financial crisis. Opponents of those measures complain that big companies have skirted their tax obligations, leaving small firms and individuals to make up the difference.European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.A year later, \u201cIreland has not recovered any money, not even in part,\u201d she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid \u201cmore conflictual waters,\u201d a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.At the time of the ruling, Europe\u2019s competition watchdogs said that Apple\u2019s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\u201dThe Irish Department of Finance said that it \u201chas never accepted the commission\u2019s analysis\u201d in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager\u2019s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had \u201cmade significant progress on this complex issue\u201d and accused the European authorities of taking a \u201cwholly unnecessary step.\u201dApple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had \u201cno valid economic justification\u201d and that the company had been able to \u201cavoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.\u201dAmazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.\u201cWe believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it \u201cpaid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\u201dAmazon said it would study the commission\u2019s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to \u201cillegal state aid.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. \u201cThe main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.\u201dA broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.\u201cThere are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,\u201d Mr. Fuest said.The European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc\u2019s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia Battles Amazon, With Populist Defiance", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 31______Then it hit me.Isn\u2019t their intense opposition to Amazon\u2019s arrival just another version of the nationalist populism of Pauline Hanson and Donald J. Trump?What if the culture industry is for the intellectual left what factory jobs are for the populist right \u2014 a piece of the economy tied to identity and nostalgia that they just can\u2019t help but want preserved and protected at all costs?There are obviously differences between resistance to a large corporate behemoth like Amazon, and resistance to, say immigrants and refugees \u2014 big differences. But at some core human level, both are driven by fear of a future defined by outsiders, and a love for what is.I recognized the emotions I heard talking to bookstore owners and writers because it reminded me of the emotions I heard talking to working-class Americans as they struggled through the global financial crisis and its aftermath. In both cases, many of the people I talked to started with jabs of outrage only to end with sighs and worry.\u201cI wish I was more optimistic,\u201d said Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend Books in Brisbane.\u201cWhat concerns me the most about the growing influence of corporations like Amazon is their worldview,\u201d said Tim Winton, the author of \u201cCloudstreet\u201d and many other well-known novels. \u201cPeople who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce.\u201dThat pessimism and the demand for a society built to a more human scale and tied more closely to identity and agency crosses ideological and international borders.Whether populism is the right word for this is an open question, but whatever it is, it may be the \u201cism\u201d of our time \u2014 a messy mishmash of human urges seeking a middle ground after the Cold War battle between capitalism and communism.Maybe it\u2019s just a function of change, and a lot of it.If that assessment is accurate, the urge to pull inward and protect your own \u2014 regardless of your professed politics \u2014 starts to make more sense.Where do you think Australia will end up falling on the spectrum between nationalism and globalism?And on a more personal note, where do you draw the line between openness to the world, and protection for the local?And now here are my picks of the week, a preview of our public event in Sydney this week with Joe Kahn, The New York Times\u2019s managing editor, and a recommendation for another newsletter we enjoy.__________And I\u2019m happy to report that he\u2019ll be back soon for more arresting work from Australia, so stay tuned.____________Joseph Kahn, the managing editor of The Times, is here in Sydney this week, and you\u2019re all invited to try and catch him in person or on the air.He\u2019ll be on ABC radio this afternoon, Thursday, around 4 p.m.In between, he\u2019ll be doing a mix of public and private discussions... and perhaps a bit of surfing.______He suggests that part of the reason is the Australian media \u2014 \u201clarge, right-wing heavy, thin on talent,\u201d he writes \u2014 and because Australia still tends to \u201cseek endorsement, or at least attention\u201d from \u201cany outsider who can stomach 22 hours on a plane.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What May Seem Good for New York Is Not Always Good for Its Mayor", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayors in New York and elsewhere have long accepted that a fundamental part of their job is to be a champion for their cities, even if it means putting aside personal preferences in the interest of being a civic ambassador.Mr. de Blasio is not that mayor.With re-election appearing to be all but assured next month, the mayor has taken pains to cement the notion that he is very much the same liberal Democrat from Brooklyn who was elected in a landslide four years ago.On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio dug in even further; the mayor, who said recently that he had never shopped on Amazon, urged the audience to follow his example \u2014 casually throwing Starbucks under the bus for good measure.\u201cIf, like me, you love your local neighborhood stores, your bakeries, your cafes, your clothing stores, all these things, then you need to spend your money there and not at Starbucks and not at other alternative places,\u201d he said, to applause from the audience in northwest Brooklyn.Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group that supported the city\u2019s Amazon bid, said the mayor\u2019s comments looked to be at odds with the city\u2019s public courting of the retailer.\u201cWhen the mayor sends this kind of mixed message, it appears that he does not think his words matter,\u201d she said.\u201cWe welcome the mayor to join us for any of these happening regularly in his hometown,\u201d the spokesman, Reggie Borges, said in an email.The mayor, his aides and supporters have defended Mr. de Blasio\u2019s stances as a reflection of his true self and say that anything else would be pandering or false. Some find his honesty \u2014 especially when it comes to the Yankees, who can cause headaches for many New Yorkers \u2014 to be refreshing in a politician.When the mayor adamantly told reporters at the outdoor event that he would not attend a game if the Yankees made it to the World Series, a fan standing nearby shouted: \u201cThe city takes precedence!\u201dAfter the news conference, the fan, Jerry Urcivoli, 45, said he was aghast that the mayor would put his loyalty to the Red Sox ahead of his role as mayor.\u201cYou don\u2019t put that aside and say, \u2018That\u2019s my personal belief and I should go as a representative of Manhattan and New York City\u2019?\u201d Mr. Urcivoli said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful the mayor\u2019s not going.\u201dIt did seem only recently that Mr. de Blasio was open to finally checking off a few boxes on his personal mayoral to-do list.But with polls showing him with a 44 percentage point lead over his closest challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican assemblywoman, Mr. de Blasio seems to be digging in again.It may also speak to both the nature of fandom and to the particularities of his deep devotion to the home team of Boston, where Mr. de Blasio grew up.\u201cExpectations would be that even when people move to new environments they tend to pick up the allegiance of the team,\u201d said Edward R. Hirt, a professor of psychology at Indiana University in Bloomington, who studies sports fandom and social identity. \u201cIf you were the mayor of that community and wanting to build community spirit you\u2019d want to be seen as identifying with that.\u201d\u201cIt is seemingly a head-scratcher,\u201d he added.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s challengers in the mayoral race were less confused.\u201cUnconscionable,\u201d Ms. Malliotakis told reporters Thursday.As for Amazon, Mr. Dietl said he did not use the site, a rare point of harmony with Mr. de Blasio. \u201cI like touchy-feely. I like to go to a store and look at what I\u2019m going to buy,\u201d he said.\u201cAs a baseball fan who also doesn\u2019t like the Yankees, I\u2019m following it with interest,\u201d Mr. Skurnik said. But he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think any significant number of voters use this as a guide to who they\u2019re going to vote for.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re watching the unlikely career resurrection of Klaus Kleinfeld, who will oversee a $500 billion economic development zone in Saudi Arabia. More on that in a moment.It took Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tiebreaking vote that struck down the ability of Americans to file class-action lawsuits against financial institutions. But Republicans had long opposed the move against arbitration clauses that had been proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it would have led to frivolous lawsuits and driven up credit card interest rates.In recent months, financial firms and their Republican allies in Congress mobilized to defeat the rule. Some credit unions and community banks also weighed in, lodging calls to lawmakers in their home states.What people are saying about the voteSome at the conference were floored that Mr. Kleinfeld had clearly landed on his feet with such large responsibility and oversight. Others dismissed the role as being a sort of exile in the desert.More in businesses courting the Saudi royalsOther tax pointsAt a policy lunch for Senate Republicans yesterday, Mr. Trump asked for a show of hands on which potential pick they preferred. The results were, shall we say, unclear.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, \u201cThe president is taking that decision very seriously.\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Baker won\u2019t do more with the real estate in the Hudson\u2019s Bay portfolio.

{"Headline": "She\u2019s 26, and Brought Down Uber\u2019s C.E.O. What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "With...Susan FowlerIn her first interview since the essay that started a wave of sexual-harassment revelations, Susan Fowler tells her life story and looks to the future.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Susan Fowler was, she recalls, \u201cover the moon\u201d in January 2016. At 24, she had just snagged her dream job as a site reliability engineer at Uber, which had recruited her by telling her the ride-hailing company was a \u201csuper-women-friendly\u201d place to work, boasting 25 percent female engineers. And she had her first date with the man who would become her husband, Chad Rigetti, who runs a quantum computing start-up in Berkeley, Calif., and who, she says dreamily, is as \u201cbeautiful\u201d as Michael Fassbender.After a movie, she pulled out her phone and opened up her Uber app to get them a car home.\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Mr. Rigetti told her. \u201cI don\u2019t use Uber.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Ms. Fowler replied, thinking he was joking. \u201cBut I work there.\u201d\u201cI only use Lyft,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you read that interview with the C.E.O., Travis, where he talked about how Uber helps him get girls? He\u2019s a misogynist. I could never use his product.\u201dMs. Fowler smiles ruefully at the memory, during her first interview since she became instantly famous. As we sit in the Clift Hotel\u2019s lobby cafe, decorated with black-and-white animal tiles, it\u2019s startling to think that this is the woman who pierced the self-indulgent, adolescent Pleasure Island mentality of Silicon Valley, causing the stunning downfall of Travis \u201cwe call that \u2018Boob-er\u2019\u201d Kalanick and starting a bonfire on creepy sexual behavior in Silicon Valley that, fueled by a report in The Times and cascading stories, spread to Hollywood and engulfed Harvey Weinstein and Amazon\u2019s Roy Price.Dressed in black jeans, brown loafers, a denim jacket \u2014 \u201cthe only clothes I can fit into\u201d \u2014 and wearing a Fitbit with a hot pink band that cost her $1 on Amazon, Ms. Fowler is 26 and seven months pregnant. She looks so young that people give her \u201cweird looks,\u201d she says, worried that she will be a teenage mother.She is petite, with an angelic smile and an air of innocence that belies a fierce will. Her Instagram account features a picture of Charlie Brown saying, \u201cBe the best you can be\u201d; a coffee mug with the motto from Apollo 13, \u201cFailure is not an option\u201d; and books she is reading on a wide array of subjects including ants. She describes herself as \u201can amateur myrmecologist.\u201dYet it was a role that Ms. Fowler had been preparing for her whole life. The Peter Pan libertines met their match in a sweet Stoic.She had what she calls an \u201cunconventional upbringing,\u201d the second child of seven in a small town in rural Arizona called Yarnell. Her father was an evangelical Assemblies of God preacher who sold pay phones on weekdays and, with his wife, home-schooled Susan and her siblings. She ended up never going to high school.\u201cSo I was kind of on my own,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to read the classics, would go to the library a lot, tried to teach myself things. But didn\u2019t really have any direction. I really had this dream that someday I could be educated.\u201dShe read Plutarch\u2019s \u201cLives.\u201d \u201cThe Stoics were really what changed me,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause their whole thing was about, \u2018You don\u2019t have control over a lot of the things that determine your life, so all you can do is focus on becoming the best person that you can be.\u2019 And that really spoke to me because I did feel, especially during my teenage years, that my life was really out of my control. I really wished that I could just learn and do all the fun things and cool extracurriculars that I thought everybody else my age was doing.\u201dMs. Fowler worked as a stable hand and a nanny to help support her family. \u201cAnd I would tell myself, in the times when I would be really, really sad, \u2018Once I get out of here, I\u2019m going to do something great.\u2019 And I would just pray at night, like, \u2018God, please just let me get out, give me opportunities to get out. I promise I\u2019ll do good with it.\u2019\u201dAt 16, she began \u201cfreaking out\u201d about her future. \u201cI had this really intense resolve. I would call universities and community colleges and say, \u2018I really want to go to college? How do I get to college. What do I do?\u2019 And they would say, \u2018You have to get an application. You have to get letters of recommendation.\u2019 It was terrifying. I had no idea what I was doing.\u201dShe figured out how to take the SAT and ACT. She made a list of all the books she had read and at the top wrote, \u201cSusan Fowler\u2019s Home School\u201d and sent it off to Arizona State University.\u201cAnd they actually gave me a full scholarship,\u201d she says, the wonder still in her voice.The college balked at letting her take math and physics to study astronomy, given her lack of high-school prerequisites. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No! I didn\u2019t come this far, now that I\u2019ve found something I really loved, to have my dream smashed,\u2019\u201d Ms. Fowler says.She applied to the top 10 colleges as a transfer student and was accepted at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was told she could study physics and given help with the steep tuition.After a rough first semester, advisers tried to steer her away from physics. So she walked into the office of Penn\u2019s president, Amy Gutmann, and left a message with her assistant: In a commencement speech, Ms. Gutmann had said that the school would help students fulfill their dreams.\u201cI heard back directly from the president herself, and she was like, \u2018You are right. This is a place for people to fulfill their dreams.\u2019\u201d She told Ms. Fowler she could get back to her whiteboards, and after that, it was \u201cfantastic.\u201dThe essay that shook Silicon Valley was called \u201cReflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber,\u201d and Ms. Fowler began by noting that it was \u201ca strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying story.\u201d Published on Feb. 19, it rocked the world\u2019s most valuable start-up, challenging the mantra that great disrupters are above the law. The blog post was notable for its dispassionate tone, as the young engineer who had left the company after a year walked the reader through everything that had gone very, very wrong in the brozilla culture of kegs, sexual coarseness and snaky competition.Ms. Fowler was on her first day with her new engineering team when her manager sent her a string of messages over the company chat system.\u201cHe\u2019s telling me that he\u2019s in an open relationship and that his girlfriend is getting laid all the time, but he just can\u2019t because he\u2019s at work all the time,\u201d she says, reprising her blog post with me. \u201cAnd he\u2019s trying really hard not to get in trouble at work, but he\u2019s really looking for a woman to have sex with. And I was like, \u2018What the hell? This can\u2019t be real. How stupid does he have to be?\u2019 But it turned out he\u2019d been getting away with this for so long, he didn\u2019t care anymore. And I feel like so many of these men, they believe that the only reason women get into these jobs is to get a guy.\u201dMs. Fowler took screen shots and reported the manager to human resources, thinking, \u201cThey\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d But they didn\u2019t, explaining that the manager was \u201ca high performer\u201d and it was his first offense, something Ms. Fowler later discovered to be untrue.\u201cSomehow I\u2019m supposed to be like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a high performer? Never mind. How dare I?\u2019\u201d she says, laughing.She wrote that H.R. told her she could either find another team to work on or stay on that man\u2019s team and expect a poor performance review. Another manager told her that if she reported stuff to H.R., he could fire her. Amid the manic, sexist behavior, the number of female engineers in the division Ms. Fowler was part of dwindled to less than 6 percent \u2014 too few, the company said, to merit ordering them the same black leather jackets they were ordering for the men.When Ms. Fowler earned some money from \u201cProduction-Ready Microservices,\u201d a book on engineering she wrote, she went out to Madewell and bought herself a black leather jacket.\u201cI didn\u2019t really care if they branded me a troublemaker,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I hadn\u2019t gotten that far in my life and overcome all these things to get treated inappropriately. I wasn\u2019t going to take it. I\u2019d worked so hard. I deserved so much better. And I was, like, \u2018No. That\u2019s not O.K. You don\u2019t get to do that.\u2019\u201dIn her memo, she says, \u201cI knew I had to be super-careful about how I said it if I wanted anybody to take it seriously. A lot of women have been whistle-blowers in the past, and a lot of them have just gotten torn down and treated terribly. One of the things that kept popping up was this idea that if you do whistle-blow about sexual harassment, then that is what will define the rest of your life. And I kind of struggled with this. But then, to me, I realized, you know what? No. Stepping back, just being in my little Stoicism Susan bubble, if what people know you for is bringing light to an issue about bad behavior, about bad stuff going on and laws not being followed and people being treated inappropriately, why wouldn\u2019t I want that? That\u2019s a badge of honor.\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t just standing up for myself. I felt like I was standing up for everyone else that I was seeing at Uber who was mistreated. It was an extremely demoralizing environment. I would see people who would get harassed or made fun of or bullied and they would go report it, and they would just get ground down by upper management and H.R. And so I felt like, if I can take this on despite the consequences, then I should do it.\u201dLike women in Hollywood I talked to after the Weinstein collapse, Ms. Fowler thought the new outspokenness in Silicon Valley on sexual harassment may have been spurred by the election of President Trump.\u201cThe second Trump won, I felt super-powerless and I thought, \u2018Oh my God, no one\u2019s looking out for us,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThey have the House, they have the Senate, they have the White House. And so we have to take it back ourselves. We have to be the ones doing the work.\u201dThe only woman on the board then, Arianna Huffington, who had vowed that the culture of \u201cbrilliant jerks\u201d must end, had been trying to help Mr. Kalanick by advising him to sleep more and meditate. But he caused another kerfuffle when he chose to meditate in the lactation room.When Ms. Fowler\u2019s memo exploded, Ms. Huffington oversaw the investigation by Eric Holder, reached out and talked to employees, and said she wanted to \u201chold the leadership team\u2019s feet to the fire.\u201d Uber later fired 20 people, including senior executives.\u201cSo I was disappointed in her because I expected her to be an advocate,\u201d Ms. Fowler says, noting that Ms. Huffington appeared on TV after the blog post to insist that there\u2019s no \u201csystemic problem\u201d at Uber.\u201cI had two friends who went to her and Liane Hornsey, who\u2019s the head of H.R., and reported various harassment discrimination,\u201d Ms. Fowler says. \u201cAnd then I was told that many other women were doing the same thing. And then Arianna went on TV that same week and said, there\u2019s no \u2018systemic problem.\u2019 Which I was like, \u2018No, a whole bunch of people just went to you this week.\u2019\u201d Ms. Fowler adds that the company\u2019s C.T.O., Thuan Pham, who knew about her complaints, is still in the same job.Ms. Huffington told me that she agreed that the problem was \u201csystemic sexism,\u201d but that she did not believe there was \u201csystemic sexual harassment.\u201d But, she added, \u201cthere should be zero tolerance for even one case of sexual harassment.\u201d\u201cI was totally supportive of having a full investigation of her claims,\u201d Ms. Huffington says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we brought in a former attorney general to investigate. I don\u2019t think you can do a lot more than that.\u201dMs. Fowler is not so sure. \u201cThe one interaction we had was right after I published the blog, when I started getting calls from friends and family and even acquaintances I hadn\u2019t talked to in years and years who were getting calls about private investigators asking about it,\u201d she says \u201cAnd I was pretty sure that this was coming from Uber or someone close to Uber. So I sent an email to some of the members of the Uber board because I was like, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re responsible for this, but hey, if you\u2019re doing this, please stop.\u2019\u201cAnd Arianna responded and she was like, \u2018Travis has assured me that he did not do this.\u2019 And I replied, asking her, \u2018O.K., well, then, could you please go and say publicly, \u201cWhoever\u2019s doing this, stop,\u201d if somebody is?\u2019\u201dMs. Huffington told me that \u201cthe board had a complete assurance from management that nothing was done like that or would be.\u201dSpeaking to The Wall Street Journal earlier this month, Ms. Hornsey, who joined Uber a month after Ms. Fowler left and a month before the famous blog post, was asked if she had ever reached out to Ms. Fowler.\u201cI have said, very publicly, \u2018Thank you\u2019 to her because she raised some stuff that did lead to change,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether there would be any benefit in meeting her. I\u2019m seriously working for my employees today; she\u2019s an ex-employee.\u201dMs. Fowler tweeted a screen shot of that part of the interview, saying: \u201cOooh burn\u201d and \u201cShe really, really doesn\u2019t like me.\u201dOn the advice of a friend, Ms. Fowler got private security for the first few weeks after she published her incendiary essay.She thinks Silicon Valley needs to get rid of forced arbitration. \u201cWhen you join these companies, they make you sign away your constitutional right to sue,\u201d she says.Ms. Fowler has taken that to the Supreme Court, and as is her wont, is studying the syllabuses of Columbia Law School so she can learn more about her rights.She now has a job at Stripe as the editor of its tech publication. And she\u2019s working with Verve, a Hollywood talent agency, developing a movie based on her experiences, described by the agency to me as \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d meets \u201cThe Social Network.\u201dAs we leave, I ask Ms. Fowler if she knows the baby\u2019s sex.\u201cA girl,\u201d she says, smiling radiantly. \u201cI\u2019m so excited. Now I\u2019m just like, \u2018Got to make this world better so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with these things.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Worries? Big Tech Companies Post Glowing Quarterly Profits", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut back on their home turfs, it is business as usual, as earnings reports from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, demonstrated on Thursday. All displayed the kinds of performances that make investors happy: profit surges, big jumps in revenue \u2014 sometimes both.If revenue growth is a good indication of giving the public what it wants, customers appear to love what the biggest technology companies are offering, whether it\u2019s cheap online storage, clothing or a social network, and the party isn\u2019t slowing down.But to a different audience \u2014 regulators, competitors, academics \u2014 the continued show of strength by big technology companies is a further sign of the risks of their getting bigger, even if there does not appear to be much of an appetite to do anything about it in the United States.\u201cI do not see, to be honest, anything between Amazon and a trillion-dollar market valuation except D.C. and Brussels, and at this point it looks more likely that it\u2019s Brussels,\u201d Mr. Galloway said, referring to the headquarters of the European Union.Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company\u2019s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.Amazon\u2019s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.The most remarkable sign of Amazon\u2019s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.Next week, Google\u2019s top lawyer, along with general counsels from Facebook and Twitter, will testify in front of lawmakers investigating how Russia used social media and technology platforms in the United States to influence the 2016 election.But as Alphabet reported another blockbuster earnings result on the back of strong sales of search advertising, the inquiry and any potential fallout were not discussed.On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google\u2019s pending appearance before Congress.Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share \u2014 surpassing Wall Street\u2019s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue \u2014 up 24 percent \u2014 while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company\u2019s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company\u2019s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion \u2014 or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.But in the past several years, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.Microsoft executives credited much of the company\u2019s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft\u2019s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.While Microsoft\u2019s attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment \u2014 its foray into making smartphones was a bomb \u2014 its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Entrepreneurs Squirm Under Xi Jinping\u2019s Tightening Grip", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Guo Junwen was a successful property developer in southwestern China when the authorities threw him behind bars three years ago on charges involving land use and seized his business.Now free, Mr. Guo \u2014 who still disputes the charges \u2014 says the police are refusing to return money they still owe him under Chinese law.\u201cThey said, \u2018We have no choice, Old Guo,\u2019\u201d Mr. Guo said in a telephone interview from the Indonesian island of Batam, where he lives part time. \u201c\u2018We have no fight against you, but this is what the higher-ups want.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe central government\u2019s policy is very positive,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cBut what is key is the issue of enforcement. The gap between the central government and local governments is still quite large.\u201d\u201cClearly, there\u2019s been a willingness to let these guys flourish but, at the same time, a desire to neutralize them as an independent political force,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a founding partner of the Beijing-based research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.Analysts say the state intervention has resulted in entrepreneurs\u2019 losing confidence in China\u2019s future. Private-sector investment has been weak, and many tycoons have parked their money abroad should they run afoul of the government.Many others choose to simply lie low. \u201cThe savvy entrepreneurs have already worked out which way the wind is blowing,\u201d said Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun\u2019s chairman.Mo Shaoping, a prominent human rights lawyer who represents Guo Junwen, said many of his entrepreneur clients were insecure. Looming over them is the fear that the government might make them pay for their \u201coriginal sin\u201d \u2014 crimes including bribery and fraud related to actions they took before China more clearly codified what is legal and what is not.Mr. Mo is skeptical about the government\u2019s claim to protect entrepreneurs, citing the lack of enforcement of private property rights. \u201cIn reality, the implementation of it has been terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to wastepaper.\u201dMr. Guo was one of China\u2019s new generation of entrepreneurs. In 1990, he toured the United States and was struck by its trappings of middle-class comfort. After that trip, he set up a computer company.He set up a real estate company in 1993 and moved into hotel management four years later, owning four hotels across China. His company, Chongqing Xiya Industrial Group, employed more than 3,000 people.He also built ties to government officials, but he felt he could not bridge the deep mistrust.\u201cSome officials who encounter entrepreneurs avoid us like we are the god of plague,\u201d Mr. Guo said.His troubles began in 2008 after he sold a real estate project to a politically connected buyer in Kunming. That investor was angered at how poorly his business was doing and wanted to get back at Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Guo and his lawyers. Officials in Kunming did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Guo\u2019s account of the dispute could not be independently verified.In 2014, prosecutors in Kunming impounded the company\u2019s hotels and real estate projects. In 2015, a court convicted Mr. Guo for illegally occupying farmland and sentenced him to two years in prison, according to court documents. He lost an appeal but was released in January 2016 for time served.Zhang Dongshuo, Mr. Guo\u2019s other lawyer, said the asset seizure violated Chinese law because the court never convicted his client of fraud. Most of the assets have been returned to Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Guo said the authorities had not returned $450,000 in cash, six villas in Kunming and three apartments in Chongqing.A party member for more than three decades, before he went into business, Mr. Guo said he was encouraged by the government\u2019s talk about entrepreneur rights. He said he looked forward to the day the party would elevate businesspeople to be senior politicians, citing President Trump as an example.\u201cLook at Trump, a businessman who could even become president,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cFor us to be like America in recognizing the importance of entrepreneurs, I think we still need a little more time.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Weinstein Company Will Not Get Planned Cash Infusion", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut those plans have changed. Colony has not and will not provide a cash infusion, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Wednesday to discuss private deliberations. It was unclear why the preliminary agreement had fallen apart.Colony, which has experience in distressed Hollywood assets, continues to explore the purchase of some or all of the Weinstein Company\u2019s assets. But Colony found more disorder than it had expected \u2014 and less value \u2014 once it started closely examining the studio\u2019s assets, according to two people who were briefed on the matter. They added that Colony saw bankruptcy as the most likely near-term outcome for the studio.Representatives for Colony and the Weinstein Company declined to comment.The Weinstein Company still has options. Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that has lent money to beleaguered film companies in the past, has been working on a potential financing package for the studio valued at roughly $35 million, which would provide enough liquidity for the studio to operate roughly through January, according to three people briefed on the matter.In her complaint, Ms. Huett said Mr. Weinstein had lured her to a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2010 with a promise to discuss acting roles and instead forced her to engage in sex acts. A spokesman for the Weinstein Company did not respond to requests for comment on the suit on Wednesday.Adding to the complexity, \u201cno one is interested in salvaging a company which would benefit Harvey,\u201d Mr. Barrack said. In other words: Would it be possible to structure a sale so that Mr. Weinstein did not benefit financially? Mr. Weinstein owns roughly 20 percent of the studio. His brother, Bob, owns an identical share. The rest is owned by about 25 investors, who hold portions of varying sizes.Several major entertainment companies have looked at buying pieces of the Weinstein Company and come away with mixed to negative reactions, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Lionsgate had interest in only one of the studio\u2019s coming films, \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d which is set for release in January. But even that family sequel has limited potential; the Weinstein Company mainly holds domestic rights.Endeavor, which owns the William Morris Endeavor talent agency and the IMG sports and fashion business, took a look at the Weinstein Company to see if there was a way to protect clients who have projects in the works there. But it concluded that clients should instead use legal tactics to pry projects loose.The Endeavor-related projects include a film adaptation of the musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d created by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes; a documentary about President Trump by Michael Moore; and a planned adaptation of \u201cThe Boys in the Boat,\u201d Daniel James Brown\u2019s book about the American rowing team that won a gold medal at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.The studio has made inroads in television, selling series to the likes of Amazon and Viacom and lining up potential shows with Showtime and Apple. But Amazon pulled the plug on its deal after the harassment scandal. Apple also walked away. Showtime said it would move forward with its project only if the Weinstein Company dropped out.Michael J. de la Merced and Kate Kelly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Xi created and empowered the cyberspace administration, which has subsumed many of the overlapping agencies that once governed content in cyberspace.The administration is now seen as an institution as important as the defense ministry. Since last year, it has been led by Xu Lin, 54, a party technocrat and former propaganda official, who, like other influential officials who previously worked beside Mr. Xi in Shanghai, has soared through the ranks.\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that technology has advanced more quickly than the government\u2019s ability to control it,\u201d Ms. Sacks said. Russia\u2019s interference with Facebook, to cite only one example, was \u201cjustification for exactly what they are doing here.\u201dThe tech firms also face tight penalties if they fail to keep users in line. In September, the cybersecurity administration imposed fines on social media platforms owned wholly or in part by three of China\u2019s biggest internet companies \u2014 Tencent Holdings, the Alibaba Group and Baidu \u2014 for failing to stop the circulation of fabricated rumors, violence and pornography. (Companies can be fined up to $76,000 per offense, and have their business licenses canceled, if they cannot prevent the transmission of banned content.)Still, China\u2019s advantage could be double-edged. Chinese internet companies have struggled to expand abroad, which experts say stems in part from their dependence on their government.Moreover, not all of the new restrictions have been welcomed here.

{"Headline": "California Today: The Plight of the Sea Otter", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Sea otters, once bountiful along the California coast, were virtually wiped out by fur traders in the 18th and 19th centuries.A population estimated at as high as 20,000 fell to mere dozens.Since coming under the protection of strict wildlife laws in 1977, the playful creatures have been rising in number, but with agonizing slowness.The most recent count in 2017 was 3,186, down 86 from a year before.It doesn\u2019t help that hundreds of sick and injured otters have been turning up dead or dying along the California coast.In 2016, California wildlife officials recorded the highest ever number of stranded otters, 474. That\u2019s up from 299 a decade earlier.The blooms occur naturally, but researchers believe they are being intensified by runoff that pushes waste and fertilizer into the Pacific. They release a toxin called domoic acid that winds its way through the marine life food chain.Melissa Miller, a Department of Fish and Wildlife veterinarian who has overseen hundreds of otter necropsies, said more research was needed to fully understand how domoic acid was harming the otter population.But she added, \u201cI think we can safely say domoic acid is a big deal in otters. The hard part is how big of a deal.\u201dOtters are regarded as a keystone species, which means they are essential components of their ecosystem.That they\u2019re struggling should sound alarm bells not only about potential harms to marine life, but to humans as well, wildlife experts say.\u201cI see them as sort of a proxy for the bigger issue of land-sea pollution,\u201d said Dr. Miller.And don\u2019t forget, she added, \u201cWe eat a lot of the same things that otters eat. And we clearly see that some of the things that otters are getting are associated with the food that they\u2019re eating.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)A benefit concert for Northern California fire victims is to be headlined by the Bay Area bands Dead & Company and Metallica.The concert will be held Nov. 9 at San Francisco\u2019s AT&T Park with tickets from $50 to $200.

{"Headline": "A Trust Buster for the New \u2018Knowledge Monopoly\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionThe technology critic is typically a captive figure, beholden either to a sorrowful past, a panicked present or an arrogant future. In his proudest moments, he resembles something like a theorist of transformation, decline and creation. In his lowest, he is more like a speaking canary, prone to prophecy, a game with losing odds. His attempts at optimism are framed as counterintuitive, faring little better, in predictive terms, than his lapses into pessimism. He teeters hazardously between implicating his audience and merely giving their anxieties a name. He \u2014 and it is almost always a he \u2014 is the critical equivalent of an unreliable narrator, unable to write about technology without also writing about himself. Occasionally, he is right: about what is happening, about what should happen, and about what it means. And so he carries on, and his audience with him.Franklin Foer, thankfully, recognizes these pitfalls even if he can\u2019t always avoid them. Who can? The melodramatically titled \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d Foer\u2019s compact attempt at a broad technological polemic \u2014 which identifies the stupendous successes of Amazon, Google and Facebook, among others, as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the individual and to society \u2014 begins with a disclaimer. Foer\u2019s tumultuous stint editing The New Republic under the ownership of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes ended with mass resignations and public acrimony. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this experience informs the argument of this book,\u201d he writes. He is likewise entangled through his proximity to publishing: The author\u2019s friends, colleagues and immediate family members \u2014 including his brother, the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer \u2014 depend to different degrees on the industry Amazon consumed first. The book is dedicated to his father, Bert, a crusading antitrust lawyer.In this slightly crouched posture, and with a hint of healthy self-doubt, Foer proceeds quickly. We, the consuming public, have failed to properly understand the new tech superpowers, he suggests, leaving little hope for stodgy and reluctant American regulators. The scope of their influence is obscured by the sheer number of things they do and sell, or problems they purport to be solving, and by our outdated sense of what constitutes a monopoly. To that end, Foer promotes the concept of the \u201cknowledge monopoly,\u201d which he qualifies with a mischievous grin. \u201cMy hope is that we revive \u2018monopoly\u2019 as a core piece of political rhetoric that broadly denotes dominant firms with pernicious powers,\u201d he says, rather than as a \u201ctechnical\u201d term referring to one company cornerning a market. (His new monopolists, after all, aren\u2019t raising prices. They\u2019re giving things away free).For much of the book, readers are parachuted into various moments in the history of computing, the internet, media and philosophy. Character introductions arrive rapidly, with a casualness that can slip into absurdity: Descartes \u201cenjoyed his sleep\u201d; Mark Zuckerberg \u201cis a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just a little bit naughty\u201d; Alan Turing was an \u201catheist and a loner,\u201d while Ray Kurzweil, the prophet of an artificial-intelligence-driven singularity, is driven by his inability to escape \u201cthe biggest fear of them all.\u201d (Death.) The effect is slightly delirious but genuinely enjoyable. Readers are flung through a highly selective history of the philosophy of mind, landing squarely on their feet in Google\u2019s A.I. laboratories. The 17th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\u2019s stubborn and total belief that knowledge could be reduced to mathematical computation leads surprisingly seamlessly into a perceptive assessment of Zuckerberg\u2019s fraught and inconsistent public relationship with the concept of the algorithm, his mission to connect the world and the billions of meaningful decisions made by Facebook\u2019s software every day.As Foer\u2019s book veers into advocacy, readers are treated to a similarly energetic and cleareyed view of the modern \u201cknowledge monopoly\u201d giants. Jeff Bezos\u2019 techno-populist suggestion that he can \u201csee the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere\u201d is contrasted with his personal purchase of The Washington Post and his stewardship over Amazon, which is a massive, diverse and participatory marketplace, but one under the control of a single private company with a reputation for ruthlessness and strong-arm negotiation tactics. \u201cOld gatekeepers might not always have been worthy of praise,\u201d Foer writes, \u201cbut at least there were a lot of them.\u201dFoer\u2019s other concession to nostalgia, in the form of an inoffensive command to return to the \u201csustaining nourishment of the contemplative life and the deep commitment to text,\u201d is overshadowed by a vigorous and novel call for regulatory intervention. He reminds us that the issue of monopoly dominated our politics for generations, even as the companies in the crosshairs changed in form and ambition. Though he makes no radical or provocative case to, say, nationalize Facebook, or to break up Google, he does suggest creating a Data Protection Authority, in the mold of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s post-financial-crisis Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and calling for government to protect privacy as it (in theory) protects the environment.Is this idealistic, plain crazy, or just impotent? The armchair technology critic \u2014 roused by Foer\u2019s sneakily persuasive manifesto \u2014 might ask in response, with a mixture of satisfaction and despair: What does it mean that it could be all three?John Herrman covers media for The Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "Why Stanford Researchers Tried to Create a \u2018Gaydar\u2019 Machine", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichal Kosinski felt he had good reason to teach a machine to detect sexual orientation.And all around Silicon Valley, where Dr. Kosinski works as a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, entrepreneurs were talking about faces as if they were gold waiting to be mined.Few seemed concerned. So to call attention to the privacy risks, he decided to show that it was possible to use facial recognition analysis to detect something intimate, something \u201cpeople should have full rights to keep private.\u201dAfter considering atheism, he settled on sexual orientation.Presented with photos of gay men and straight men, a computer program was able to determine which of the two was gay with 81 percent accuracy, according to Dr. Kosinski and co-author Yilun Wang\u2019s paper.The backlash has been fierce.\u201cI imagined I\u2019d raise the alarm,\u201d Dr. Kosinski said in an interview. \u201cNow I\u2019m paying the price.\u201d He\u2019d just had a meeting with campus police \u201cbecause of the number of death threats.\u201dAt the heart of the controversy is rising concern about the potential for facial analysis to be misused and for findings about its effectiveness to be distorted.Indeed, few of the claims made by researchers or companies hyping its potential have been replicated, said Clare Garvie of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology.\u201cAt the very best, it\u2019s a highly inaccurate science,\u201d she said of promises to predict criminal behavior, intelligence and other character traits from faces. \u201cAt its very worst, this is racism by algorithm.\u201dDr. Kosinski and Mr. Wang began by copying, or \u201cscraping,\u201d photos from more than 75,000 online dating profiles of men and women in the United States. Those seeking same-sex partners were classified as gay; those seeking opposite-sex partners were assumed to be straight.Some 300,000 images were whittled down to 35,000 that showed faces clearly and met certain criteria. All were white, the researchers said, because they could not find enough dating profiles of gay minorities to generate a statistically valid result.The images were cropped further and then processed through a deep neural network, a layered mathematical system capable of identifying patterns in vast amounts of data.The software extracts information from thousands of facial data points, including nose width, mustache shape, eyebrows, corners of the mouth, hairline and even aspects of the face we don\u2019t have words for. It then turns the faces into numbers.\u201cWe showed that this model produces slightly different numbers for gay and straight faces,\u201d Dr. Kosinski said.The authors were then ready to pit their prediction model against humans in what would become a notorious gaydar competition. Both humans and machine were given pairings of two faces \u2014 one straight, one gay \u2014 and asked to pick who was more likely heterosexual.The participants, who were procured through Amazon Mechanical Turk, a supplier for digital tasks, were advised to \u201cuse the best of your intuition.\u201d They made the correct selection 54 percent of the time for women and 61 percent of the time for men \u2014 slightly better than flipping a coin.Dr. Kosinski\u2019s algorithm, by comparison, picked correctly 71 percent for of the time for women and 81 percent for men. When the computer was given five photos for each person instead of just one, accuracy rose to 83 percent for women and 91 percent for the men.Yet none of the scenarios remotely resembled a scan of people \u201cin the wild,\u201d as Ms. Garvie put it. And when the tool was challenged with other scenarios \u2014 such as distinguishing between gay men\u2019s Facebook photos and straight men\u2019s online dating photos \u2014 accuracy dropped to 74 percent.There\u2019s also the issue of false positives, which plague any prediction model aimed at identifying a minority group, said William T.L. Cox, a psychologist who studies stereotypes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Let\u2019s say 5 percent of the population is gay, or 50 of every 1,000 people. A facial scan that is 91 percent accurate would misidentify 9 percent of straight people as gay; in the example above, that\u2019s 85 people.The software would also mistake 9 percent of gay people as straight people. The result: Of 130 people the facial scan identified as gay, 85 actually would be straight.\u201cWhen an algorithm with 91 percent accuracy operates in the real world,\u201d Dr. Cox said, \u201calmost two-thirds of the times it says someone is gay, it would be wrong.\u201dHe noted in an email that \u201cthe algorithms were only trained and tested on white, American, openly gay men (and white, American, presumed straight comparisons),\u201d and therefore probably would not have broader implications.Regardless of effectiveness, the study raises knotty questions about perceptions of sexual orientation.\u201cCan artificial intelligence actually tell if you\u2019re gay from your face? It feels weird \u2014 it feels like physiognomy,\u201d he said.\u201cI still personally sometimes feel uncomfortable, and I have to reconcile this as a scientist \u2014 but this is what the data shows,\u201d said Dr. Rule, who is gay.That is not to say that all LGBTQ people have the similar facial features, or even that there are only two kinds of sexuality, he said. But to pretend that sexual orientation is invisible \u201csuffocates our ability to approach inequity.\u201dGiven that the Stanford study was based on dating profile photos \u2014 which may contain all kinds of additional hints about preferences \u2014 the results should be taken with \u201cnot just a grain, but a tablespoon of salt,\u201d he added.Liking curly fries, for example, was a reliable predictor of higher than average intelligence. Liking Wu-Tang Clan was a tip-off to male heterosexuality. All of our online likes, Dr. Kosinski said, have left us vulnerable to microtargeting by political candidates, companies and others with nefarious intentions.Within several weeks of publication, Facebook had changed its default settings, keeping likes private. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar\u201d to the controversy over his current project, he said. \u201cI was basically trying to warn people. People didn\u2019t take it seriously.\u201dA major difference, though, is that Dr. Kosinski did not attempt to explain why \u201cliking\u201d curly fries indicated intelligence. It was simply a pattern identified by a machine.To account for a link between appearance and sexuality, Dr. Kosinski went further, drawing on what his study called \u201cthe widely accepted prenatal hormone theory (P.H.T.) of sexual orientation,\u201d which \u201cpredicts the existence of links between facial appearance and sexual orientation\u201d determined by early hormone exposure.The notion that it\u2019s \u201cwidely accepted\u201d was quickly disputed.Even many experts who are supportive of the theory, said they could not see how a study of self-selected dating photos made the case that gay people have gender-atypical faces, let alone a theory that attributes distinctive features to hormones.The discussion of P.H.T. made the authors sound out of touch, said Dr. Cox: \u201cMost sex scientists agree that there is no single cause to sexual orientation.\u201dDr. Kosinski and Mr. Wang say that the algorithm is responding to fixed facial features, like nose shape, along with \u201cgrooming choices,\u201d such as eye makeup.But it\u2019s also possible that the algorithm is seeing something totally unknown.Only later did analysts realize that the American tanks had been photographed on a sunny day and the Russian tanks had been photographed on a cloudy day. The computer had learned to detect brightness.Dr. Kosinski said that they went to great lengths to guarantee that such confounders did not influence their results. Still, he agreed that it\u2019s easier to teach a machine to see than to understand what it has seen.The study is on still on track to be published by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, though no date has been set. The paper had already made its way through the official peer review process before unofficial reviewers began ripping it to shreds.Dr. Kosinski\u2019s reputation may be permanently damaged, he said, but he has no regrets. Officials in a country where homosexuality is criminalized someday soon may turn to facial analysis to identify gay men and women.\u201cThe question is, can you live with yourself if you knew it\u2019s possible and you didn\u2019t let anyone know?\u201d he asked.An article on Tuesday about attempts to use facial recognition software to detect sexual orientation misstated the name of a school where Rebecca Jordan Young is chairwoman of women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies. It is Barnard College, not Barnard University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Farm, Investors Get Their Hands Dirty", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersJesse Fink was a co-founder and chief operating officer of the internet travel site Priceline when it went public in 1999. The offering made him instantly wealthy, and he retired almost immediately.With such promise come numerous risks. Land and farms are not liquid investments. Climate change has made the weather less predictable, with droughts mixed in with torrential rains, and early frosts in some parts of the country countered with abnormally warm periods in other parts.Still, the broader argument for long-term growth in this sector is that people around the world are eating healthier and the demand will push up the value of sustainable agriculture.Shawn Lesser, a co-founder of Big Path Capital, an investment bank focused on impact investments, which seek social as well as financial returns, said interest in agriculture had surpassed that of clean energy and affordable housing.\u201cWith agriculture or land, there are more knowns than with clean energy,\u201d Mr. Lesser said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for people to get their arms around it.\u201d\u201cFood and agriculture have emerged as two of the most promising areas to achieve social and environmental objectives,\u201d Mr. Bouri said.How investors put money into this field, and what they expect in return, differ as widely as a person\u2019s preference for food. Investors looking to buy a sustainable farm should ask how willing they are to spend on their passion, said Lee P. Miller, a managing director at the Glenmede Trust Company.In 2005, the Finks turned their land into a 75-acre sustainable farm, growing crops and raising chickens, pigs and sheep. They also used what they learned from the project to inform other investment and philanthropic decisions involving sustainable agriculture, access to food, and food waste, Ms. Fink said. \u201cIt was a labor of love.\u201dMs. Fink said some items produced at Millstone Farm made money, but the overall farm did not in the nearly 12 years the family owned it.\u201cThe way we ran it, it was not profitable,\u201d Ms. Fink said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dollars that go into upfront infrastructure: buildings, fencing, greenhouses, buying a refrigerated truck.\u201dThe Finks purchased the farm for $5.48 million in 2005 and sold it for $5.9 million in 2016, public records show.But the costs were not all dollars and cents. \u201cThe toughest parts were staffing, really finding the right people who believed in the mission and actually had the skills,\u201d Ms. Fink said.Understanding the level of capital and labor involved may prompt investors to make a smaller commitment to sustainable agriculture. They might opt instead to invest in land and lease it to farmers or invest through funds that are more broadly diversified.Ms. Miller said there was a divide between sustainable farmers who eke out a living and her clients, whom she called the passion farmers.\u201cIt\u2019s about how much they want to invest in their passion,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to make money.\u201dShe had been the chairwoman of National Welders Supply Company, which her father started and which she sold in 2007 to Airgas, and her first order of business was to create a sport clay field where she could shoot. Her second, she said, was to find an animal to raise that she would not grow attached to. After much thought, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d get attached to a fish.\u201dShe sells farm-raised tilapia and various types of lettuce and other vegetables. Hers is a twist on sustainable agriculture: using the fish to increase the nutrients in water to grow the plants and then cleaning the water so it gets used again.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely different than running anything like National Welders Supply Company,\u201d she said. \u201cThis one takes quite an investment up front. You have to be willing to make your mistakes. You have to put in a year or two before you make a profit.\u201dTo that end, she said, she added a conference center to the property to help pay for the agricultural operation.He said one of his more satisfying investments \u2014 buying 300 head of cattle for a farmer so he could increase his organic, grass-fed beef business \u2014 lost money. \u201cWe opened up a market faster and more cheaply than any grant\u201d could do, he said.With the herd, the farmer was able to expand his business. And Mr. Crosby said he was able to see the value in an investment loss for tax purposes.The fund now has $50 million in farmland investments, and has appreciated at 10 percent a year for the last decade, said Mr. Miller, the fund\u2019s chief executive.Yet his investors had to commit money to a fund that had no plans to sell the improved land and return their capital on a fixed date. \u201cWe never guaranteed any distribution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said, \u2018Over time, you can expect your investment to increase as the farmers restore the soil and increase the value.\u2019\u201dGiven the capital- and labor-intensive nature of agriculture, having a long-term plan for such investments is crucial.\u201cA lot of the work we do philanthropically and through impact investment is focused on climate change and climate change mitigation,\u201d Mr. Fink said. \u201cWhat the farm taught us was the impact of weather volatility. We got to learn firsthand what The Farmer\u2019s Almanac has said for years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Look, I don\u2019t write the show. I\u2019m 48, I guess Amy is in her 40s, and poor Alia is 28. So yes, on the surface it seems there is a huge age difference. What\u2019s your point?\u201cWere you nervous to film these sex scenes because your body is so gross? Did you not realize you were going to be mostly nude on TV?\u201d (Scott, my brother)Me: I meant to get in shape, I really did. As you know, we had a baby this year (your niece), so it\u2019s been hard to exercise much. Sorry if this was distracting to you.\u201cWhat is your wife going to say when she sees this?\u201d (my mom)Me: Hi mom. We watched it together. We always binge the whole season when it comes out. It was pretty uncomfortable, as you can imagine. I think I forgot to mention that I was shooting those scenes while she was home with the baby. How is dad?\u201cWere you actually nude? How does that whole thing work?\u201d (Jason, a guy I used to work with)Me: Really, man? We are nude-ish. Everybody wears flesh-colored bottoms. Mine were like those jobs that ballet dancers wear. The goal is to make everyone as comfortable as possible in a very uncomfortable situation. They even ask people that aren\u2019t needed to leave the set. So it ends up being the three almost-naked people, rolling around in bed with a sweaty camera guy and a grinning sound girl standing over us.\u201cThey pay you to film this smut?\u201d (my dad)Me: Yes, Dad. How\u2019s Mom?In all seriousness, I get why people are curious. Most of us will probably never get the opportunity to experience a sexual situation like this. It looks great on paper. But in the real world, to me, it would feel like a lot of work. It\u2019s hard enough to please one person in bed. Another person would just... Zzzzzzzzz. Sorry, I got tired just thinking about it. So many areas to get around to! So many feelings to consider! And I know I\u2019d get jealous and wonder if those other two are having fun without me when I\u2019m not looking. Not to judge. If this is your life and it\u2019s working, more power to you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harvey Weinstein, Hollywood\u2019s Oldest Horror Story", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn her autobiography, \u201cChild Star,\u201d Shirley Temple described going with her mother to see her new bosses at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after leaving Fox.Louis B. Mayer spirited away Gertrude Temple. The curly-haired superstar \u2014 hailed by F.D.R. for helping America get through the Depression \u2014 was taken to the office of Arthur Freed, an associate producer on \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201dAfter telling her that she would have to get rid of her baby fat, Freed abruptly stood up and pulled out his penis. The 11-year-old had never even seen one before. She gave a nervous laugh, which offended the producer.\u201cGet out!\u201d he shouted.\u201cNot for nothing was the M.G.M. lot known as the \u2018factory,\u2019 a studio perfumed with sultry, busty creatures with long legs and tight haunches,\u201d Temple wrote, \u201cand more than its quota of lecherous older men.\u201dNearly 80 years later, that aroma of perversion and maladroit du seigneur clings to Hollywood. Now we are inundated with grotesque tales of Harvey Weinstein pulling out his penis to show to appalled and frightened young women, enlisting the pimping help of agents and assistants to have actresses delivered to his hotel rooms, where he pestered the women to watch him shower or give him a massage or engage in intimate acts.\u201cThe ill will towards him for getting away with it all for so long has unleashed something so primitive,\u201d a prominent male Hollywood producer told me. \u201cIf people could rip him apart, they would. Literally everyone in Hollywood is taking marshmallows to roast at his burning corpse.\u201dDana Calvo, the creator of \u201cGood Girls Revolt,\u201d noted: \u201cWe have been saying, just get us in the room. But we meant the pitch room or the editing room or the boardroom. Not Harvey Weinstein\u2019s hotel room.\u201cI do know I will never look at bathrobes the same way. It\u2019s the bathrobes versus the pussyhats.\u201dWhile not a victim of Weinstein\u2019s, Calvo worked for Amazon Studios, which was headed by Roy Price until he was suspended on Thursday for sexual harassment allegations. He had already come under scrutiny for being culturally tone deaf, passing on two of the biggest hits of the year, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d both of which swept the Emmys for their storytelling about women. And he canceled the popular \u201cGood Girls Revolt\u201d after one season, admitting he had never watched it.Weinstein, 65, was the opposite, one of the rare men in Hollywood who didn\u2019t care about pursuing an audience of 15-year-old boys with comic book movies. He was someone with taste who was trying to make movies with great roles for women of all ages, a top Democratic fund-raiser who was pushing to make Hillary Clinton the first woman president, a man trusted by the Obamas to have their daughter intern at his company.But he had a diabolical side. He would tantalize actresses with dreams of stardom \u2014 in that dewy, fleeting window such hothouse orchids have to take Hollywood by storm. Often the actresses scrambled, trying to figure out how to get out of the room without having their futures shredded by the vindictive satyr, who also threatened to destroy actresses who balked at wearing dresses designed by his wife Georgina Chapman\u2019s fashion label on the red carpet.He relished the nickname \u201cHarvey Scissorhands,\u201d given to him by filmmakers who did not like his domination in the editing room. But the nickname could work just as well for his octopus ways with women, which resulted in lots of hush money being paid out.And some of his own assistants say they were assailed. One ran out of the room, crying and distraught, after Weinstein pressed her into giving him a massage.Some who were importuned or pawed, like Angelina Jolie, stalked away and told studio executives that she would never work with the pestilent mogul. Others whom Weinstein asked to give him a massage in his hotel suite refused but continued to collaborate, like Gwyneth Paltrow, who put aside qualms to become \u201cthe first lady of Miramax.\u201dOther victims, like Rose McGowan, took settlements from the mogul to stay quiet but continued to seethe, until her rage spilled over Thursday when she tweeted \u2014 after getting back on Twitter after an absurd banishment by the company \u2014 that Weinstein had raped her.Once more we are in a searing national seminar on sexual misbehavior by men, just like the Hill-Thomas hearings, the Clinton impeachment hearings, the Bill Cosby trial, the downfalls of Roger Ailes, Bill O\u2019Reilly and other harassing big shots at Fox News, and Donald Trump and the fallout from the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.How many times do we have to go through this before things really change?\u201cIf you look at The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s powerful women list,\u201d said Janice Min, the former editor of that publication, \u201cevery single one of those women still reports to a man.\u201d (By some estimates, there are only six women who have first-look overhead producing deals at the studios.)Min recalled attending the $400,000 speech Barack Obama made as an ex-president to an A&E Networks advertising upfront at the Pierre hotel in New York in April.\u201cAfterwards, amid rapturous applause, he walks right over to Harvey Weinstein and gives Harvey a hug,\u201d Min said. \u201cYou can see the optics of it all. It makes your head explode if you think of the inability to explode the male network.\u201dMin said that although The Hollywood Reporter tried to get the goods on \u201cthat looming, ominous, bellicose force\u201d named Harvey for many years \u2014 \u201cwe had white boards full of names of women\u201d \u2014 he was a master at protecting himself, just as Hugh Hefner was, by the veneer of power he cultivated, by giving to liberal causes and cultivating friends in the media and politics.\u201cThere probably needs to be some introspection about how certain people who engage in horrendous mistreatment of women can co-opt the media,\u201d she mused. \u201cThe fundamental predatory nature of Hollywood is young, attractive people \u2014 largely females \u2014 putting themselves in front of men to be judged and appraised and chosen.\u201cIt is a dark equation. From the moment the proverbial girl gets off the bus, the odds are stacked against her. In Hollywood, unlike at other Fortune 500 companies, the one-on-one meetings take place in hotel suites and bars. It\u2019s an exploitative and oddly personal process.\u201dYoung actresses (and surely actors, too, with other powerful predators), Min said, knew that \u201cHollywood is built on nothing but the pursuit of Oscar and Emmy. Harvey had proven time and again he could get you the Oscar that could make your career. It\u2019s the difference between being in the reboot of \u2018Saved by the Bell\u2019 or getting 15 million for your next role.\u201dHollywood is a culture that runs on fear. And it is not like other professions, one top entertainment executive said, because \u201cno one comes with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It\u2019s about what you look like and who sent you.\u201dThere was resentment against Weinstein in Hollywood, not only for the stories bubbling around about women, but the way he humiliated men who worked with him. He even berated a 15-year-old girl at a screening because her parents supported a political candidate he opposed.Like Trump, that other self-professed predator, there were complaints that in business deals he stiffed people on bills (advertising and public relations payments), and he had a reputation for lying, cheating, taking advantage, acting like a thug. Many in the film community felt he besmirched the Oscars by turning it into a marketing race rather than a contest of quality.I asked Tim Robbins, who had some unpleasant business dealings with Weinstein, what the moral of this foul, revolting story should be.\u201cIt\u2019s not just in show business, it\u2019s every business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about men who use power to get an advantage over women. It\u2019s gross, it\u2019s unacceptable, but unfortunately, it\u2019s pretty persistent.\u201dWomen in Hollywood say social media, plus the anger about Trump getting into the Oval Office instead of Hillary, were propelling forces in the fire raining down on Weinstein.\u201cI hope it\u2019s a witch hunt,\u201d said a top Hollywood woman. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a purge. There are people we have to get rid of in our business. Everyone knows them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Fractious Final Debate in the New Jersey Governor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWAYNE, N.J. \u2014 They were combative right from the start, armed with well-practiced barbs and bumper-sticker-ready quotes. They argued over property taxes, a troubled transportation system and the legalization of marijuana.But rarely in the final debate in the campaign for New Jersey governor did the two candidates actually debate.In a race that has turned caustic in its waning days, Philip D. Murphy, the Democratic candidate, and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, his Republican opponent, spent most of Wednesday night speaking past each other, seemingly eager to land the next attack and often restrained by the moderators from launching into any sort of extended exchange.But after a first debate that was distinguished by the candidates\u2019 sharp differences on immigration and a shift to the right by Ms. Guadagno, the second and likely final debate veered back to issues \u2014 and lines of attack \u2014 that have been central to the campaign.Ms. Guadagno focused on property taxes, tying nearly every answer back to her vow to lower the burden on voters, partly through her plan to cap school property taxes at 5 percent of a family\u2019s annual income. Mr. Murphy, she said, had no plan to lower property taxes.For his part, Mr. Murphy said ensuring that the state fulfills its obligation to fund schools completely was a form of property-tax relief, since it would lessen the burden on individual taxpayers. He said the Christie administration underfunded New Jersey schools by $9 billion.\u201cWhere are you getting the money? That $9 billion is coming from your back pocket,\u201d Ms. Guadagno said, referring to taxpayers.\u201cThe $9 billion is coming from your wealthy friends,\u201d he replied, referring to his plan to close corporate tax loopholes in the state. \u201cThe corporations and the hedge funds you have taken care of.\u201dMr. Murphy chose to focus primarily on the failures of the Christie administration, often pinning them on Ms. Guadagno.He claimed that pension plans had been underfunded by $23 billion under Mr. Christie and Ms. Guadagno, all while the state had \u201cbeen downgraded 11 straight times\u201d by financial services firms.Mr. Murphy, who has had a commanding lead in polls throughout the general election campaign, has at times pursued a cautious approach, trying, it seems, not to stumble while having the upper hand. At Wednesday\u2019s debate, he sought to avoid providing direct answers on some divisive issues.When asked if he would commit to extending a cap on raises for police officers and firefighters, he demurred, saying he was waiting for a report on the issue, which is scheduled to be released in December.When reminded that the election was in November and that voters were looking for him to offer an answer, Mr. Murphy again balked.\u201cAbsent the facts, I will not,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.In a debate marked by criticisms interrupted by moderators, the most combative moment of the night occurred when the candidates were allowed to question each other directly. Ms. Guadagno went first: \u201cHow do you plan on paying for all of the promises you made during the primary?\u201dMr. Murphy started his answer by lamenting what he called the false attacks Ms. Guadagno had made against him, but then was interrupted by an audience member\u2019s shouted interruption, which he claimed not to be able to hear.\u201c\u2018Answer the question\u2019 was the shout,\u201d Ms. Guadagno said.Mr. Murphy smiled and said, \u201cI hope you were this aggressive with Governor Christie all these years in debating policy.\u201dWhen it was his turn, Mr. Murphy noted that he and his opponent occasionally took similar positions on issues during the campaign that were different from Mr. Christie. But referring to her tenure as lieutenant governor to Mr. Christie, he asked, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\u201cIf I had a battle, I made those in private,\u201d she said.Ms. Guadagno also said that she supports Mr. Christie\u2019s plan to offer Amazon billions in tax credits to try to persuade the company to locate its second headquarters in New Jersey, though she did not commit to having it be in Newark.Mr. Murphy said he endorsed the idea of luring Amazon to the state, but wanted to ensure that New Jersey also would gain from any deal.\u201cFirst of all, I hope Amazon comes to New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got to come on terms that don\u2019t just work for them but work for us.\u201d He said that he would invest in infrastructure improvement like Newark Liberty International Airport, an expanded light rail network and improved public education as a way to entice Amazon.Mr. Christie, as he has throughout the campaign, was often at the center of the debate with Ms. Guadagno, again trying to further distance herself from the governor she has served for nearly eight years.She noted that she broke publicly with the governor on the issue of raising the gas tax, which Mr. Christie supported.\u201cPhil Murphy, on the other hand, stood with the governor,\u201d she said.And when a moderator asked if she would appoint Mr. Christie to the Senate should Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, who is on trial on federal corruption charges, be convicted and forced out of Congress, she offered an emphatic answer.\u201cNo,\u201d she said, with a large smile. \u201cThat was an easy one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Big Bet on Streaming Relies on Little-Known Tech Company", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor two days in late June, Disney\u2019s board of directors gathered at Walt Disney World in Florida to wrestle with one topic: how technology was disrupting the company\u2019s traditional movie, television and theme park businesses, and what to do about it?The most startling presentation came from Disney\u2019s biggest division \u2014 a $24 billion television operation anchored by ESPN and Disney Channel. Cord cutting was accelerating much faster than expected. Live viewing for some children\u2019s programming was in free fall. At the same time, streaming services like Netflix were experiencing explosive growth.And that was how the Disney board, which includes Silicon Valley stars like Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, came to bet the entertainment giant\u2019s future on a wonky, little-known technology company housed in a former cookie factory: BamTech.In August, Disney announced that it would introduce two subscription streaming services, both built by BamTech. One, focused on sports programming and made available through the ESPN app, would arrive in the spring. The other, centered on movies and television shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, would debut in late 2019.\u201cWe\u2019re going to launch big, and we\u2019re going to launch hot,\u201d Mr. Iger promised at a subsequent investor conference.Disney had experimented with building a streaming platform on its own, to mixed results. It also toyed with the idea of buying Twitter.But Mr. Iger was impressed with BamTech. Based in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea Market, a former factory for the National Biscuit Company, the 850-employee company has a strong track record \u2014 no serious glitches, even when delivering tens of millions of live streams at a time. BamTech also has impressive advertising technology (inserting ads in video based on viewer location) and a strong reputation for attracting and keeping viewers, not to mention billing them.\u201cBamTech really is as good as it gets,\u201d said Mike Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and technology consultant.BamTech grew out of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam for short, which was founded in 2000 as a way to help teams create websites. By 2002, Bam was experimenting with streaming video as a way for out-of-town fans to watch games.Soon, Bam developed technology that attracted outside clients, including the WWE, Fox Sports, PlayStation Vue and Hulu. HBO went to Bam in 2014 after failing to create a reliable stand-alone streaming service on its own. Could Bam get HBO up and running \u2014 in just a few months?Bam built HBO Now for roughly $50 million, delivering it just in time for the Season 5 premiere of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which went off flawlessly. \u201cThey were nothing short of herculean for us,\u201d said Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s chief executive.Disney started talking about the inevitable shift toward streaming in 2006, according to Kevin Mayer, Disney\u2019s chief strategy officer. But the world\u2019s largest entertainment company had to be careful: It could not embrace a new business model at the expense of its still highly profitable existing one \u2014 at least not until it saw a tipping point.So Disney, along with other television companies, first tried something called TV Everywhere. Introduced in 2010, it allowed people to watch television shows on mobile devices as long as they \u201cauthenticated\u201d themselves as current cable or satellite subscribers. But that cable bundle-saving effort proved cumbersome and never completely caught on.About three years ago, Disney started to look at streaming more aggressively. Disney experimented with going it alone, quietly developing an app called DisneyLife. Introduced in November 2015 in Britain, DisneyLife offered old Disney movies and television series, children\u2019s e-books, games and music. Subscriptions cost about $13 a month.The lesson from that was without new movies, or at least exclusive content, interest was limited. Disney soon cut the subscription price in half. After two years, analysts estimate that DisneyLife has only about 437,000 subscribers. (It was never introduced outside Britain.)So when Mr. Iger decided in June that the time had come to reposition Disney\u2019s television division for growth by offering its sports, movies and television programming directly to consumers, he asked BamTech to accelerate Disney\u2019s option to take a controlling interest. By early August, Disney had agreed to spend an additional $1.58 billion to bring its BamTech stake to 75 percent.Most analysts cheered Disney\u2019s streaming plans, but some investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach. One reason is cost.Start-up expenses are unknown, but Disney has signaled that they will be huge. (Analysts estimate that marketing alone could easily run $150 million annually.) Disney has also not announced how much it will charge for subscriptions to the still-unnamed services. (Analysts are guessing $5 to $9 a month.) What is certain: To stock its own offerings, Disney plans to pull content from other services \u2014 Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm movies will eventually disappear from Netflix \u2014 eliminating an enormous, reliable revenue stream.Michael Nathanson, a media analyst, estimates that Netflix, for instance, pays Disney $325 million annually to license those films. Also moving to one of the services will be reruns of Disney Channel shows, which generate roughly $500 million annually in third-party licensing fees, according to Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at UBS.At the same time, Disney has pledged to make original movies and series for its nonsports service, easily adding $150 million in costs.There has also been some sniping about how much Disney paid for BamTech. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference last month, Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, boasted that his company\u2019s All Access and Showtime streaming services had been built internally.Disney contends that a big part of BamTech\u2019s value has been overlooked. Down the road, as other media companies move toward streaming, BamTech intends to sign them up as clients.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a massive business, and BamTech is going to be a massive winner in it,\u201d Mr. Mayer, Disney\u2019s chief strategist, said in an interview.Still, by the end of next year, BamTech will lose one important customer: HBO, which is moving to a global platform built by its own tech team. \u201cThey understood from the very beginning that eventually we would grow our way to independence,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.For some, Disney\u2019s track record with digital acquisitions is the biggest concern.Before a turnaround in recent years, Disney.com gave the company headaches, with managers trying a series of redesigns and strategic retrenchments.Mr. Paull, a Harvard M.B.A. with experience at Sony Music, will report to Mr. Mayer, who joined Disney in 1993 before leaving in 2000 to run Playboy.com. He soon returned to Disney to work on Go.com, a web portal that eventually failed, and other Disney websites, including ESPN.com, before moving to strategic planning.Though BamTech has proved its streaming bona fides, it still lacks the algorithms and the personalization skills that have helped propel Netflix to success. To fill that gap, Mr. Paull recently hired the former chief technology officer of the F.B.I. to be the head of analytics.BamTech\u2019s headquarters are a massive sprawl. Inside the darkened \u201ctransmission operations center\u201d on a recent afternoon, walls of monitors displayed hundreds of live events \u2014 baseball, golf, hockey, boxing, a speech by President Trump \u2014 being streamed to somewhere at that moment.Outside the operations room, in a series of alcoves, including one that used to house an oven where Oreos were baked, employees monitor games and are the first line of defense if something goes wrong with a stream. They\u2019re nicknamed the Night\u2019s Watch, from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dThe level of engineering required for that enormous volume of content is no small matter. Each bit of streamable content has to be made to fit a dizzying number of requirements. Start with web browsers, ranging from Safari to Chrome or Explorer, all of which have slightly different demands. It also has to fit every iPhone and Android phone. And then there are connected living room devices like Apple TV.\u201cThe complexity there is incredible,\u201d Mr. Paull said during a tour. \u201cIt\u2019s thousands and thousands of different applications we need to build to support that entire ecosystem. Then you add in international and the complexities of languages, currencies, payment mechanisms.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s one of the big, big barriers to entry if you want to have a scaled digital video service.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and a picture caption misstated the prior work experience of Michael Paull, the chief executive of BamTech. He oversaw Amazon Prime Video and introduced Amazon Channels; he did not introduce Prime Video.Brooks Barnes reported from Burbank, Calif., and John Koblin from New York.Advertisement"}

According to Amazon, the Style Check feature uses \u201cmachine-learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists\u201d to judge different outfits, awarding them an overall rating to decide which is \u201cbetter\u201d based on \u201ccurrent trends and what flatters you.\u201dThe images it takes of you happen to be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud until you delete them. And while the fashion-savvy assistant helps you decide what to wear, it has an ulterior motive: to sell you clothing, including choices from one of Amazon\u2019s own apparel lines, such as Lark & Ro and North Eleven, started in 2016.It\u2019s these kinds of intersections \u2013 like this small collision between robot \u201chelpfulness\u201d and a latent commercial agenda \u2014 that can make parents like me start to wonder about the ethical niceties of this brave new bot world. Alexa, after all, is not \u201cAlexa.\u201d She\u2019s a corporate algorithm in a black box.Grace doesn\u2019t like it when I tell her what to wear. How would she feel about Alexa judging her? Would she see it as helpful or crushing? This could well be one of our parenting tasks in the near future \u2014 preparing our children for the psychological repercussions of such personal interactions with computer \u201cpeople.\u201dAlmost 80 percent of the children thought Alexa would always tell the truth. Some of the children believed they could teach the devices something useful, like how to make a paper plane, suggesting they felt a genuine, give-and-take relationship with the machines.How do we teach our children to question not only the security and privacy implications but also the ethical and commercial intentions of a device designed by marketers?Our kids are going to need to know where and when it is appropriate to put their trust in computer code alone. I watched Grace hand over her trust to Alexa quickly. There are few checks and balances to deter children from doing just that, not to mention very few tools to help them make informed decisions about A.I. advice. And isn\u2019t helping Gracie learn how to make decisions about what to wear \u2014 and many more even important things in life \u2014 my job? I decided to retire Alexa to the closet.Rachel Botsman is the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cWho Can You Trust? How Technology Brought Us Together and Why It Might Drive Us Apart,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.Advertisement"}

Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.Walmart took down listings for bump stocks on its website this week.

{"Headline": "From Amazon, a Change That Hurts Authors", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAmazon decided to allow third-party sellers to be featured atop the primary purchase button for new books, a spot previously reserved for Amazon\u2019s own inventory, which comes directly from the publishers. Approved third-party sellers \u201cwin\u201d this placement through a secret algorithm that considers, among other things, price, availability, seller\u2019s rating and shipping time. In doing so, Amazon abdicates its role as the prime retailer on its own website. The main requirement is that the books offered by the third-party seller must be \u201cnew.\u201dSo when you, the customer, hit that main buy button, you should always expect to get a brand-new book, right?Not necessarily.To explain why, we have to take a journey into the underbelly of the book market. Have you ever asked yourself, when shopping for books on Amazon, how third-party sellers can be offering dozens of \u201cnew\u201d books at prices way below even the discounted Amazon price? The reason is that such books could have been bought in bulk by a handful of giant online third-party sellers to be re-sold through Amazon as \u201cnew\u201d books, when some are not.Where do these gray market books originate? There are several possible sources.Bookstores can return unsold books for credit. The publisher or distributor will sometimes sell these returns at a discount in bulk as overstocks, or sell excess inventory as remainders. Huge online bookstores buy these books (perfectly legal). Often, these books are marked with a line indicating they are remainders. But sometimes, they are not. In such cases, the online bookstore might resell them as \u201cnew\u201d on Amazon.Blemished books also seem to feed the gray market for \u201cnew\u201d books. Bookstores will return shopworn books or those damaged in shipping under the category of \u201churt books.\u201d The publisher sells these books as used books. Online bookstores may buy them in bulk, sort through them, and resell as \u201cnew\u201d the least damaged through Amazon.Publishers sell books to international wholesalers at large discounts on a non-returnable basis. By contract these books must be sold abroad, but wholesalers could quietly dump these books in the American market through a third-party seller on Amazon, cheating the publisher.Print-on-demand has created a new unscrupulous enterprise, that of counterfeiting books. These books look perfect; there is no way for the customer to tell they are illegal.And finally, a number of review copies are sent out free to media outlets. They are not supposed to be sold. Some book sellers apparently have standing arrangements with magazine conglomerates and television networks to bulk purchase all the review copies they receive, which they could presumably then sell on Amazon. While this isn\u2019t strictly illegal, it is unethical \u2014 and terribly unfair to authors and publishers.These third-party sellers may not always be selling \u201cnew\u201d books, according to Amazon\u2019s own published definitions on its website, which, in part, read:\u201cNew: A brand-new, unused, unread copy in perfect condition. The dust cover and original protective wrapping, if any, is intact.\u201d\u201cUsed \u2014 Like New: Dust cover is intact, with no nicks or tears. Spine has no signs of creasing. Pages are clean and not marred by notes or folds of any kind.\u201dIn many of these sales, the author gets zilch, or close to zilch. And, according to the Independent Book Publishers Association, which has been conducting its own research into the issue by purchasing books on Amazon, the customer is sometimes sold a used book under false pretenses.Publishers and authors, deprived of income and royalties, have long worried about this gray market. Amazon, to its credit, quickly tightened up its definition of a \u201cnew\u201d book, to the one cited above. These definitions make clear that remainders are not regarded as \u201cnew\u201d books, and the company insists that it follows a strict policy as to what qualifies.\u201cOnly new books are eligible to be featured in the U.S. Books New Buy Box and be the \u2018primary offer\u2019 on a book\u2019s detail page, whether offered from third party sellers or Amazon,\u201d a company spokersperson said. \u201cWe move quickly to address any violations. These recent changes mean that our U.S. online bookstore now works like the rest of Amazon.com, where third party sellers compete with Amazon for the sale of new items.\u201dThe Authors Guild has urged publishers to keep better track of remainders, overstocks and excess-discount sales, and some publishers have responded. But the cost of policing the market, marking and tracking books, and suing malefactors has proved daunting. Remainder overstock sales bring some revenue for publishers, but the authors receive little to no royalties.Amazon, in its drive to take over the book market, has made a change that, at least inadvertently, can mislead its own customers and be hurtful to authors. The Amazon action comes at a time when authors are struggling more than ever to make a living in the harsh economics of the digital marketplace. Amazon\u2019s policy will help undermine authors\u2019 incomes even further if it directs customers to \u201cnew\u201d books for which the author receives no royalty.Comments posted online by buyers of everything from camera equipment to fountain pens suggest that Amazon\u2019s third-party sellers sometimes operate in a broadly gray area, failing to disclose provenance before a sale. Only after buyers try to repair broken items do they learn warranties aren\u2019t honored because the goods are gray.Amazon does what it can to rein in bad actors but it is at the top of a slippery slope in turning over its main buy button for new books to third-party sellers. This policy is bad for books, bad for authors and bad for Amazon\u2019s customers.Douglas Preston is a journalist, novelist and board member of the Authors Guild.Advertisement"}

Damien Cave, the Australia bureau chief for The Times, who is based in Sydney, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Even now, in an office we just moved into after a few months in a temporary space, we have access to the new national broadband network, but we need a cellular backup for when service drops or slows to a crawl.Another thing I\u2019m weighing at the moment is whether we need phones \u2014 not cellphones but desk phones. Does anyone really need those anymore, especially in journalism?What tech equipment additions did you bring into the bureau?We\u2019re still finishing up and figuring out what we need, but I bought a Sonos speaker \u2014 partly to offset the music we can hear from the hip sneaker store below us; partly because I find that music can be a useful team builder and a tool for inspiration.I\u2019ll never forget when David Gonzalez, a longtime Times reporter I\u2019ve always greatly admired, came into a class I was in at Columbia Journalism School and started playing Miles Davis. The song was \u201cSo What,\u201d and his point was that journalism required a sense of adventure, improvisation and humility.What stands out to you in the Australian tech landscape? Is there a flourishing scene of Australian tech brands, apps and websites?There is definitely a flourishing start-up scene. I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success. But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon. Are Australians excited?Reaction is pretty mixed. Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States. Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States. Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore \u2014 she was in her 20s \u2014 who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card. I was stunned.But to some degree this may simply be a product of unfamiliarity. Once Amazon is here, and if it can really undercut some of the very high prices that Australians are stuck with, I imagine there will be a lot of converts.Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now?What do you and your family do with it, and what could be better about it?I use the headphones for music (of course) and for phone calls, but last night I called my wife walking back from dinner in Melbourne and I discovered that the microphone really doesn\u2019t work well with a bit of wind. I don\u2019t know how that could be fixed, but finding a way to ensure good audio for conversation would be one obvious improvement.And as long as we\u2019re talking audio: Hey, Sonos, how about adding some Bluetooth connectivity for those of us with unreliable Wi-Fi?What is your favorite local Australian app or website and why?Gumtree is my favorite. I\u2019ve used it to buy a grill, a gas heater for winter and a bunch of other things. The selection is wide ranging; you can easily filter by neighborhood and distance.It\u2019s great, especially for someone like me who moves a lot and arrived here with nothing but a few suitcases full of clothes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Turns on the Charm Amid Criticism From Right and Left", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On a sunny day in July, commuters arriving at Union Station, in the shadow of Capitol Hill, were greeted with free bananas passed out by Amazon employees. In a Senate building, lawmakers and their aides attended policy panels on how Amazon manages privacy on its Echo devices and how sales for small businesses are booming on its online store.The day was capped off with a cocktail reception hosted by Amazon\u2019s chief spokesman, Jay Carney \u2014 the former press secretary to President Obama.Amazon is sweeping the nation\u2019s capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period.The company\u2019s more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company\u2019s overall reputation, is a break from its past. Before last year, the company relied on a no-frills operation for more than a decade, prodding officials in Washington on narrow laws and regulations and arguing about the nuances of issues like sales taxes and copyright.The efforts may not directly apply to an imminent bill or regulation, but they allow the company to steer policy conversations that may be important to Amazon in the future. Amazon is hosting events for lawmakers, like the day of events in July, and holding discussions on transportation and labor policies for congressional staff and policy makers at its sleek offices near Capitol Hill. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other political leaders have visited Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers in their home districts, where Amazon talks up the thousands of jobs those warehouses support.Amazon\u2019s strategic shift has happened as politicians are getting bolder in their criticism about the size and influence of big tech companies. Republicans and Democrats alike have focused on issues including antitrust, privacy and public disclosure.Many of the harshest attacks have been directed at Facebook and Google, which also have robust lobbying arms in Washington. But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company\u2019s push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition. President Trump has lashed out at the company and Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive, multiple times, accusing the company of avoiding taxes among other things. The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes.\u201cThe concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon\u2019s $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy.Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201cThey are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that\u2019s helped it generate a lot of media attention,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon.Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations. More than a dozen organizations were new to its sponsorship roster, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Foundation and the conservative Law & Economic Center at George Mason University.Amazon is racing to catch up. Yet even with similar lobbying armies, Google and Facebook have not escaped criticism \u2014 in their cases over their platforms\u2019 potential to shape public opinion.\u201cWith Amazon, we need more transparency and need to look at longer term factors when it comes to competition,\u201d Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Senator from Minnesota said in a recent interview. \u201cThe people at the Justice Department in antitrust need to look at deals in other ways.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lost and Found in Translation: Streaming Isn\u2019t Afraid of Subtitles", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingWhen I worked at a prominent movie magazine many years back, I\u2019d often hear from executives and filmmakers who invested in independent and foreign movies that The Kids Today simply refused to watch foreign films with English subtitles. And what a shame this was. While it was true that foreign-language pictures in the 1990s never reached the consistent heights of popularity in the United States that they had in the \u201960s and \u201970s, I was mostly offered anecdotal evidence of a bias against subtitles.My explorations of the streaming world and encounters with enthusiasts suggest to me that there\u2019s not a lot of anti-subtitle feeling out there. Checking out the world of streaming video over the past year, I\u2019ve accumulated some anecdotal evidence of my own, which leads me to conclude that subtitling is not a problem for contemporary viewers, particularly younger ones with interests in genre material. I began looking into the subject in detail recently because of the uneven quality of the subtitles themselves.The ins and outs of subtitling are too complex to get into in much detail here. In the days when celluloid was the predominant movie production and display format, translated dialogue for foreign-language movies was printed onto the film itself. Video technology made this unnecessary. DVDs and Blu-rays can have multiple subtitled translations \u201cauthored,\u201d or encoded onto the disc, separate from the movie\u2019s image; called up from a menu, the subtitles are superimposed in sync with the movie.A lot of subtitling on streaming video follows the same principle. But rather than being authored onto a disc, subtitles will either be attached to the video material in a way similar to printing or burning them in, or be available as closed captions, which exist in a server cloud along with the other components of a movie or series. Once the user chooses to watch a film with its subtitles, the streaming service pulls all the components together and displays them at once. If there\u2019s a glitch, you\u2019ll get subtitles running ahead or behind the movie\u2019s action. There\u2019s not much to be done in this case except start over and hope everything comes together properly.Through a spokeswoman, Amazon declined to comment for this article, but in past exchanges on this topic I\u2019ve received indications that the company is in the process of improving its subtitling practices.\u201cAnime is a unique medium, an art form in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Decker said. \u201cJapanese artists have a different philosophy of animating; motion is not as important as composition and framing. And the soundtrack, in the original, is crucial. The interplay between visual fields and stillness and silence is really important. You can\u2019t really preserve that with a dubbed soundtrack.\u201d Mr. Decker also notes that creating a new dubbed soundtrack involves a significant investment. \u201cBut while a bad or insensitive dub can kill a piece of material,\u201d he continued, \u201ca good subtitling translation, made with empathy for the audience and the creator, provides a great new experience.\u201dHow is the empathy ensured? The answer goes back to the site\u2019s origins. Crunchyroll was founded by computer engineers who wanted to get hold of new anime without resorting to bootlegs. One thing that was notable about a lot of privately circulated anime before Crunchyroll was that fans would devotedly translate and subtitle the episodes using home video superimposition technology, with results better than what studios provided at that time.\u201cOfficial subtitling was a little more assembly line,\u201d Mr. Decker said. \u201cCranked out. And fans said accuracy matters. The medium drew them in to strive to understand the foreign culture, which raised the bar on the quality of the translation.\u201d Crunchyroll staffs its subtitling force with many such fans, and they\u2019re responsible for quickly translating the new anime programs. (The idea of \u201cfan translation\u201d is not as newfangled as it sounds; in the postwar era, Herman G. Weinberg and Donald Ritchie translated into English many classics of European and Japanese cinema; these men were critics and academics of course, but also enthusiasts.) \u201cWe have teams around the world, and we can get a half-hour episode of an anime series translated and subtitled, with our own software, in 12 hours.\u201d Crunchyroll\u2019s newest language, Mr. Decker said, is Russian.Crunchyroll mostly translates from Japanese. Netflix has a bigger back-and-forth linguistic challenge. \u201cThe major differentiator for Netflix subtitles versus DVD is scale,\u201d Marlee Tart, a corporate public relations officer at Netflix said. She explained that the company has had to develop its own tools to create and manage the huge number of subtitle \u201cassets\u201d that Netflix\u2019s content makes necessary. \u201cThe tools were easily addressed in our engineering team,\u201d Ms. Tart wrote in an email, \u201cand we have built a highly scaled pipeline for ingesting and processing subtitles, and detecting a wide range of issues.\u201dOne can imagine how wide, given that Netflix reaches more than 100 countries. As it happens, the Japanese language posed a challenge for this streaming company. \u201cWhen we started working our Japanese subtitles, we found that there was no open standard that supported the important and unique Japanese features,\u201d including vertical text, she said. The company is still working on a solution. \u201cIn order to do Japanese subtitles well, we have had to invest a significant amount of time in subtitle standardization work,\u201d Ms. Tart said. \u201cThis effort is ongoing, and we hope to have a single, global subtitle standard by the end of 2018.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Focused Bets on Growth Propel Three Stock Funds", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe managers of three of the third quarter\u2019s better-performing mutual funds thrived by betting on growth: They all favored companies that have been increasing their earnings at faster-than-average rates.They are also willing to double their bets, holding far fewer stocks than the typical actively managed mutual fund.Managers sometimes load up on lots of stocks \u2014 the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar holds 164 \u2014 to diversify their holdings, preventing a few bad bets from sapping the overall return. Some research has shown, Ms. Starke said, that \u201cyou get rid of much of that risk by the time you hit 20 stocks.\u201d She said she tried to own what she called \u201ccore growth names,\u201d like Facebook and Amazon, and would then \u201cpepper in some interesting emerging companies.\u201d When managers hoard too many stocks, she said, their funds can end up performing like the overall market.In sleuthing out shares, Ms. Starke leans toward the information technology and health care sectors. \u201cThat\u2019s where you find the most innovation and differentiation,\u201d she said. Her largest holding at midyear was Alexion Pharmaceuticals, a maker of drugs for rare diseases.Alexion has been restructuring, with layoffs and a planned move of its headquarters from New Haven, Conn. to Boston. An internal investigation uncovered improper sales practices, but Ms. Starke said she viewed the company\u2019s troubles as transitory. \u201cThey have a growing drug pipeline,\u201d she said, \u201cand the bad news didn\u2019t affect the longer-term fundamentals.\u201dThe distinctive nature of biotechnology companies\u2019 product pipelines is a draw for Ms. Starke. \u201cThe companies are typically not competing against each other \u2014 they can all be addressing different diseases,\u201d she said. The health care sector, which includes biotechnology, recently accounted for about a third of her fund\u2019s assets \u2014 about twice as much as her average Morningstar peer.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 1.15 percent, returned 8.1 percent for the third quarter, compared with the 4.48 percent returned by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500.John H. Neff, one of the three portfolio managers, said that he and his two colleagues, Charles T. Akre Jr. and Thomas Saberhagen, liken their investment process to a three-legged stool. They seek businesses with strong competitive advantages, skilled and honest management and promising opportunities for reinvestment.\u201cOur job is to be as discriminating as we can in identifying these three-legged stool businesses and to be discriminating in what we pay for them,\u201d Mr. Neff said. If stocks do not meet those criteria, the fund will sometimes let cash build up. \u201cIf we\u2019re not seeing opportunities that meet that hurdle, it sits.\u201dA theme in the portfolio is what Mr. Neff called \u201cbottleneck\u201d or \u201ctoll-bridge\u201d businesses: outfits that operate at a choke point in the economy and profit from their position.Consider Mastercard, a top recent holding. The volume of electronic transactions, which Mastercard processes, continues to grow, but cash and checks still prevail worldwide, Mr. Neff said. That represents a hefty opportunity for handlers of electronic payments. \u201cWhatever you buy and wherever you buy it in the world, we own a business that has improving odds of being involved,\u201d he said.Mr. Neff said that another of the fund\u2019s top holdings, Moody\u2019s, the credit-rating agency, likewise stood athwart a toll bridge: Its ratings are critical in the issuance of bonds and other debt securities. The biggest raters \u2014 Standard & Poor\u2019s is the other \u2014 came under fire after the financial crisis because some of the subprime mortgage bonds they classified as investment-worthy ended up collapsing, and some policy makers have called for greater competition in the industry. So far, though, Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s continue to dominate, and Mr. Neff said that he and his colleagues do not foresee that changing soon.The Akre fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 1.34 percent, returned 9.99 percent in the third quarter.Mr. DuFour has latelyheard that bang coming fromtechnology stocks, which accounted for 40 percent of the fund at September\u2019s end. In picking stocks, he said, he does not heed sector classifications. \u201cI\u2019m sector agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cMy overweights change based on where I find good investments, and I see great stuff in tech now.\u201dHe added he did not see his technology investments as bets solely on computers and the web. PayPal, for example, was a top recent holding, and the company is an innovator in the technology for handling online payments. \u201cBut they also do loans and credit cards,\u201d he said.The growth in electronic payments is one of the three themes that unify the fund, he said. The others are the internet, especially the emergence of artificial intelligence, and exchanged-traded funds.Mr. DuFour said that working for Fidelity, one of the country\u2019s largest asset managers, had given him insight into the upsurge in E.T.F. investment. Fidelity, like its industry counterparts, has had money flow out of its actively managed funds and into its passively managed ones, including E.T.F.s, he said. (An E.T.F., like a traditional index mutual fund, often tracks an index.)\u201cAs I look for ways to play that, it turns out that people who own the indexes are in a very advantageous position,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, in my top 10, one of the names that shows up is Standard & Poor\u2019s,\u201d which is also a leading creator of indexes. Every E.T.F. built around, say, the S.&P. 500 must pay Standard & Poor\u2019s for theright to use the index.Mr. DuFour\u2019s fund, which has a retail expense ratio of 0.62 percent, returned 7.75 percent in the third quarter. Mr. DuFour has managed the fund since 2007. Over that time, it has returned an annualized average of 8.41 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do We Believe Women Yet? The Battle to End Sexual Harassment", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetro ReportThe phrase most commonly used to describe a particularly noxious form of workplace aggression is sexual harassment. But sexual predation is more apt in many instances. What is it, if not predatory, when a male boss abuses his power to demand physical gratification from a female employee?New laws and workplace regulations came to pass in the hope of addressing the problem, yet it persisted. Fast forward to 1991. That was when the lawyer and academician Anita Hill testified before an all-male \u2014 and strikingly unsympathetic \u2014 Senate committee that was holding hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court. Ms. Hill described having been sexually harassed by Justice Thomas when he was her superior at two federal agencies, the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He denied the accusations, and ascended to the court. But Ms. Hill struck a chord that still reverberates.\u201cOne of the things about my testimony, I believe, that resonated so much with women was that it seemed so regular, so much like what was going on in their day-to-day lives,\u201d she told Retro Report.\u201cI never, ever expected to be the face of sexual harassment,\u201d Ms. Carlson said.She is also aware that sexual hostility on the job falls most heavily on women who are far less privileged than she or than many of the women in movies, television, high tech and other glamorous industries who also report being hounded by predatory bosses. Victims are more likely to be lower-paid workers whose plight rarely makes headlines: waitresses and female bartenders who have to fend off employers and customers with hyperactive hands, or women just trying to get through the day unscathed in the male-dominated construction industry.\u201cWe really aren\u2019t helping push society forward because nobody\u2019s hearing about these cases,\u201d Ms. Carlson said. She added, \u201cSo many times \u2014 well, almost all times \u2014 society does not find out how prevalent sexual harassment is in the workplace.\u201dOne remedy suggested by some advocates is to stretch the bounds of so-called sunshine in litigation laws that several states have enacted. Applied to tort cases in general, they essentially nullify the confidentiality clauses of legal settlements if the result is to hide conditions that qualify as \u201cpublic hazards.\u201d Some advocates argue that a workplace pattern of sexual harassment deserves to be called such a hazard, but this approach has yet to be tested in the courts.Half a century ago, the makers of Virginia Slims cigarettes pitched their product to women with a slogan that spoke of new empowerment: \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, baby.\u201d At all too many workplaces, they\u2019ve come a long way, maybe.Advertisement"}

Customers never have to step inside the store.A personal shopper is something you might expect at Bergdorf Goodman or a boutique on Madison Avenue.Not at the Walmart on Route 42 in Turnersville, N.J.But that\u2019s where you will find Joann Joseph and a team of Walmart workers each day, filling up shopping carts with boxes of Honeycomb cereal, Cheez-Its and salted peanuts.The customers select their groceries online, and then the shoppers pick the items off the store shelves and deliver them to people when they arrive in the parking lot. Customers never have to step inside the store.\u201cIt\u2019s about saving people time,\u201d Ms. Joseph said as she helped load groceries into the back of a minivan one morning.Walmart, which is one of the largest food retailers in the United States, sees grocery pickup as a way to marry its e-commerce business with its gigantic network of stores \u2014 a goal that has eluded many other retailers. The company started ramping up the service two years ago, and it is now available in about 1,000 of Walmart\u2019s 4,699 stores across the country.The initiative is the latest salvo in Walmart\u2019s retail battle with Amazon, and the centerpiece of its strategy to gain the upper hand in the pursuit of consumers looking to streamline their food shopping.Many retailers are focused on new ways to deliver groceries to people\u2019s homes \u2014 particularly in big cities. Walmart is betting big on the millions of Americans in suburban and rural areas who drive everywhere. The company is trying to make ordering groceries online and then picking them up in your car as seamless as a fast-food drive-through.Grocery delivery companies like Fresh Direct have spawned a contest among traditional grocers and start-ups to offer faster home delivery.While these initiatives are limited to only a few states, the company\u2019s grocery pickup is widespread. Walmart is betting that a big part of the country (\u201cfrom Scranton to Sacramento,\u201d one Walmart executive said) is more of a drive-through than delivery culture.There is a risk that Walmart\u2019s new grocery strategy could undercut its sales of other products. Selling groceries has lower profits, but it brings customers into the store regularly, allowing Walmart to push bigger-ticket items.\u201cThat is the philosophy of the Supercenter: You put all these other categories under one roof,\u201d said Gene German, a professor emeritus of food marketing at Cornell University. \u201cSo if the customers don\u2019t go into the stores, that could be a negative.\u201dBut Walmart believes that the \u201chigh touch\u201d approach of online grocery ordering is improving people\u2019s opinion of the shopping experience at its stores, making them more likely to purchase general merchandise in addition to food.\u201cWe get feedback and how much they appreciate the time that we take\u201d in fulfilling a grocery order, said Mike Turner, a vice president of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce operations, said in an interview.Walmart does not disclose its online grocery sales. But when the company reported its second-quarter results in August, it said online sales, including grocery, had increased 60 percent from a year earlier.The company also indicated that overall food sales growth had been the best in five years.For decades, Walmart was seen as the world\u2019s foremost innovator in retail. But even as the company has become the world\u2019s largest retailer, it has been overshadowed in many ways by Amazon\u2019s rapid growth and many advancements.Amazon\u2019s long-term strategy for Whole Foods, however, is not clear. Amazon must figure out how to sync its core online business and warehouse network with more than 460 Whole Foods stores, many of which are in high-priced urban areas and can be costly to operate.Walmart faces a different set of challenges and opportunities with its online grocery pickup \u2014 which were on display at the Supercenter in Turnersville, outside Philadelphia.The strategy\u2019s promise is that Walmart can uses its thousands of stores as mini-fulfillment centers, while also avoiding the costs of home delivery. But the store does not always function like a warehouse.One morning, Ms. Joseph walked through the aisles, pushing a cart and scrolling through a hand-held device that listed the order a customer had placed online.Like GPS services for cars, her device mapped out the most efficient route: She grabbed a box of Honeycomb in one aisle then a box of Lipton Berry Tea in another.But when Ms. Joseph reached the peanut aisle, she hit a snag. The customer had ordered a five-pack of individual-size servings of salted peanuts.There were no more individual-size packs. She checked the candy and snack displays at the cash registers, but there were none there, either.So Ms. Joseph improvised. Borrowing a colleague\u2019s iPhone, she calculated the amount of peanuts in the pack of individual servings, and then she selected a jug of peanuts with comparable volume.\u201cYour instinct needs to kick in,\u201d Ms Joseph said. \u201cAnd you go with it.\u201dEach substitution is supposed to be clearly marked with a sticker so the customer is not surprised.Customers order their groceries online and then can pick them up at the store, a few hours later during a certain time window.Walmart is also showering grocery pickup customers with perks \u2014 Easter eggs hidden in grocery bags, a \u201cbeauty box\u201d for moms at Mother\u2019s Day, dog biscuits and discounts for recruiting new customers.It\u2019s unclear how the company will be able maintain this kind of dedicated service if a store is inundated with pickup orders, which in many stores are free of charge and require an order of $30 or more.Walmart said it had hired thousands of workers to staff the new service across its many stores.\u201cThis is something Walmart could get into easily and quickly,\u201d Mr. German said. \u201cAnd it would send a message to shareholders: We are not going to be passive. We are going to be proactive.\u201dCustomers who order online choose a one-hour window in which they can pick up their groceries. When they arrive at the Walmart parking lot, they pull into designated grocery pickup spots, which at some stores resemble a gas station with a canopy overhead. Minutes later, a personal shopper emerges from the store with bags of groceries.When Laura Rothwein of Clayton, N.J., pulled up in her minivan to the side of the Turnersville store, the personal shoppers greeted her 6-year-old son with a treat from the bakery and a bottle of red Gatorade.A short time later, Sherri Arrison, a retiree, arrived in her Nissan Murano. One personal shopper loaded groceries into the back, while another held out a bright orange umbrella to shelter the food from the rain.\u201cThis is pretty much the only way I shop now,\u201d Ms. Arrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to go into the store and keep walking around.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Amazon Took Seattle\u2019s Soul", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the passing of Thursday\u2019s deadline for final bids, it\u2019s been strange to watch nearly every city in the United States pimp itself out for the right to become HQ2 \u2014 and us. Tax breaks. Free land. Champagne in the drinking fountains. Anything!In this pageant for prosperity, the desperation is understandable. Amazon\u2019s offer to create 50,000 high-paying jobs and invest $5 billion in your town is a once-in-a-century, destiny-shaping event.Amazon is not mining coal or cooking chemicals or offering minimum wage to hapless \u201cassociates.\u201d The new jobs will pay $100,000 or more in salary and benefits. In Seattle, Amazon employees are the kind of young, educated, mass-transit-taking, innovative types that municipal planners dream of.So, if you\u2019re lucky enough to land HQ2 \u2014 congrats! But be careful, all you urban suitors longing for a hip, creative class. You think you can shape Amazon? Not a chance. It will shape you. Well before Amazon disrupted books, music, television, furniture \u2014 everything \u2014 it disrupted Seattle.At first, it was quirky in the Seattle way: Jeff Bezos, an oversize mailbox and his little online start-up. His thing was books, remember? How quaint. How retro. Almost any book, delivered to your doorstep, cheap. But soon, publishers came to see Amazon as the evil empire, bringing chaos to an industry that hadn\u2019t changed much since Herman Melville\u2019s day.The prosperity bomb, as it\u2019s called around here, came when Amazon took over what had been a clutter of parking lots and car dealers near downtown, and decided to build a very urban campus. This neighborhood had been proposed as a grand central city park, our own Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, with land gifted by Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder. But voters rejected it. I still remember an architect friend telling me that cities should grow \u201corganically,\u201d not by design.Cities used to be tied to geography: a river, a port, the lee side of a mountain range. Boeing grew up here, in part, because of its proximity to spruce timber used to make early airplanes. And then, water turned the industrial engines that helped to win World War II.At the bottom of the brain index was Muskegon, Mich., a place I recently visited. I found the city lovely, with its lakeside setting, fine old houses and world-class museum. When I told a handful of Muskegonites about the problems in Seattle from the metastatic growth of Amazon, they were not sympathetic.Amazon is secretive. And they haven\u2019t been the best civic neighbor, late to the charity table. Yes, the company has poured $38 billion into the city\u2019s economy. They have 40,000 employees here, who in turn attracted 50,000 other new jobs. They own or lease a fifth of all the class A office space.But median home prices have doubled in five years, to $700,000. This is not a good thing in a place where teachers and cops used to be able to afford a house with a water view.Our shiny new megalopolis has spawned the inevitable political backlash. If you think there\u2019s nothing more annoying than a Marxist with a bullhorn extolling a failed 19th-century economic theory, put that person on your City Council. So Seattle\u2019s council now includes a socialist, Kshama Sawant, who wants \u201cthe public\u201d to take over Amazon ownership. Other council members have proposed a tax on jobs. Try that proposal in Detroit.As a Seattle native, I miss the old city, the lack of pretense, and dinner parties that didn\u2019t turn into discussions of real estate porn. But I\u2019m happy that wages have risen faster here than anywhere else in the country. I like the fresh energy. To the next Amazon lottery winner I would say, enjoy the boom \u2014 but be careful what you wish for.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re thinking about the implications of the decision by Ken Chenault, one of the financial world\u2019s biggest names, to retire as C.E.O. of American Express next year. More on that in a moment.We\u2019re going to get to talk with Mr. Chenault, who has agreed to speak at DealBook\u2019s sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, on Nov. 9. He\u2019s the latest addition to a lineup that already includes Uber\u2019s Dara Khosrowshahi and Laurene Powell Jobs.When Mr. Chenault was named Amex\u2019s C.E.O. in 2001, he became only the third black person to run a Fortune 500 company.And with Ursula Burns having retired as Xerox\u2019s chief executive in January, there are no black women running Fortune 500 companies.\u201cPart of the problem is a lack of good succession planning to groom African-Americans to get to the top.

And it now pays more than half of its revenue to Google for cloud data services.Those are some of the reasons Snap\u2019s stock chart since going public looks like this:The growing power of the biggest tech companies worries even top figures in the industry.Speaking of SnapIt boils down to this: The economy is performing well right now. So why mess with anything?\u201cI trust her to make prudent decisions, particularly when it matters most, which is if there is another crisis. Continuity and experience seem especially valuable right now.\u201dThe problem, according to Mr. Appelbaum:She may also become a victim of her own success. Steady economic growth and the tranquillity of financial markets have emboldened some critics, who see an opportune moment for a transition to new leadership.And cases for other candidatesElsewhere in bank regulationHealth careWe warned that it was too early to assume the Murray-Alexander proposal was a done deal.TaxesThe biggest proposed takeover of 2017 so far may get even more expensive.ACS has bid $20.1 billion for the toll road operator Abertis.

So-called deal jumping is a big reflection of that confidence.Hochtief\u2019s topping bid for Abertis is the second biggest announced since 2015, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

{"Headline": "In St. Louis, Protests Over Police Violence Disrupt Economy, and Win Attention", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. LOUIS \u2014 Chris Sommers, who runs a chain of successful pizza restaurants here, has long supported both sides in the fierce standoff between police officers and black residents playing out in this city.He donated to civil rights groups after the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., which is just 10 miles away. He also backed officers, giving them discounts at his pizzerias and supporting the mayoral candidate endorsed by the police union.But Mr. Sommers chose sides about a month ago.After protesters peacefully marched past one of his restaurants one night, Mr. Sommers said riot-ready police officers came through the empty street. He said they indiscriminately fired pellets, shot tear gas as his patrons dined on the sidewalk and chased after him when he cursed at them to stop. It was an inexplicable and unnecessary show of force in his view.\u201cI was an outspoken critic already of the criminalization of being black,\u201d said Mr. Sommers, who is white. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as personal until the police tried to wreak havoc on me and my business. Unfortunately, it took that for me to get as angry as I need to be.\u201dAlthough the demonstrations have not drawn the crowds or national media attention of those in nearby Ferguson and other cities, the outrage of Mr. Sommers reflects the surprising impact they have had.While regional leaders say they are confident the area can thrive economically amid the demonstrations, protest leaders have gotten their attention. The protesters have largely won the public relations battle against the police \u2014 who have made some embarrassing missteps in their handling of the demonstrations \u2014 and have seized the media narrative, with the local press reporting on their complaints against particular officers and police tactics.With a focus on disrupting the city\u2019s economy, the protests have forced the city to pay more than $3 million in police overtime and have led to lost revenue after a couple of major concerts were canceled. Demonstrations \u2014 or even just the fear of them \u2014 have prompted grocery stores and malls to temporarily close. And some wonder whether the unrest will harm the region\u2019s bid to lure the new Amazon headquarters.\u201cI think people are nervous about irreparable harm to the civic identity,\u201d said the Rev. Starsky Wilson, a co-chairman of the commission created in the aftermath of the Ferguson shooting.If nothing else, said Mr. Wilson, who is black, the persistent protests should alert cities nationwide that people will not be satisfied by endless commissions and policy proposals that do not result in action.\u201cThey\u2019ll be back if you don\u2019t take seriously their concerns,\u201d he said.Still, demonstrators are not declaring victory.For as much as they have gotten Ms. Krewson\u2019s attention, she has not heeded one of their loudest demands \u2014 to immediately replace Chief O\u2019Toole, who is white, with a chief they believe would work better with the community.Many of the changes they are asking for \u2014 more robust civilian oversight, a more diverse department, bridging racial inequalities \u2014 are fixes that will take time. And many familiar racial divisions remain: At a recent St. Louis County Council meeting over police pay raises, the pro-police crowd was largely white, applauding those who spoke in favor of officers but remaining silent when others advocated reforms.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any real, tangible, systemic change at all, from how the police are allowed to police us to how they\u2019re allowed to engage with us during protests,\u201d said Dhoruba Shakur, a 27-year-old black man, as he marched alongside a group of about 50 protesters on a recent evening with an AR-15 rifle slung over his shoulder. \u201cBut we\u2019re not done.\u201dThere have been protests nearly every day since the verdict in the Stockley case on Sept. 15. The core group organizing the demonstrations cut their teeth in Ferguson and say they have adjusted their strategy based on their experiences there.They focus on protests that cause economic disruption, often targeting white neighborhoods.\u201cWe are bringing it to the doors of people who do not have to live this life and just giving that little bit of uncomfortableness,\u201d said LaShell Eikerenkoetter, a protest leader who is black. \u201cNow you understand what we as black folks feel and why we are out here.\u201dThe demonstrations employ an element of surprise to throw off the police. They have attracted a diverse crowd and word is spread by live-streaming demonstrations online.\u201cFerguson, we were driven off passion, anger. We were just flat out mad,\u201d said Bruce Franks Jr., a state representative who is black, and who began his activism in Ferguson. \u201cNow we\u2019re mad, we\u2019re still passionate, we\u2019re still angry. But we concentrate heavily on strategy now.\u201dThe demonstrations have made some people afraid to come to the city because they fear that there is chaos and that police officers are afraid to do their jobs, said Brad Waldrop, a real estate developer who is white. Mr. Waldrop is skeptical that the attempt by protesters to apply economic pressure will lead to broad reforms, because of all the municipalities and counties in the region that operate independently.Some of the activists\u2019 biggest victories have come at the expense of the police.The episodes have eroded trust in a force already struggling to improve community relations in a city trying to rein in its high murder rate, residents said.\u201cThe Police Department has taken a black eye,\u201d said Heather Taylor, a police sergeant here who is president of the Ethical Society of Police, the union representing black officers. \u201cI think we\u2019ve earned it.\u201dMs. Krewson, who is white, made the unusual step of publicly criticizing her chief, calling his remarks inflammatory. She requested that the Justice Department investigate allegations of officer misconduct in their response.\u201cI hear them louder,\u201d Ms. Krewson said of the protesters. \u201cI understand them better because we\u2019re living this day-to-day.\u201dFollow John Eligon on Twitter @jeligon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Is Not Your Friend", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "Such a somber, self-critical statement hasn\u2019t been typical for the usually sunny Mr. Zuckerberg, who once exhorted his employees at Facebook to \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d In the past, why would Mr. Zuckerberg, or any of his peers, have felt the need to atone for what they did at the office? For making incredibly cool sites that seamlessly connect billions of people to their friends as well as to a global storehouse of knowledge?Lately, however, the sins of Silicon Valley-led disruption have become impossible to ignore.Almost from its inception, the World Wide Web produced public anxiety \u2014 your computer was joined to a network that was beyond your ken and could send worms, viruses and trackers your way \u2014 but we nonetheless were inclined to give these earnest innovators the benefit of the doubt. They were on our side in making the web safe and useful, and thus it became easy to interpret each misstep as an unfortunate accident on the path to digital utopia rather than as subterfuge meant to ensure world domination.Now that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the questions of the hour are, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is? And do we still have the regulatory tools and social cohesion to restrain the monopolists before they smash the foundations of our society?To illustrate their point, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page boasted of the purity of their search engine\u2019s results for the query \u201ccellular phone\u201d; near the top was a study explaining the danger of driving while on the phone. The Google prototype was still ad-free, but what about the others, which took ads? Mr. Brin and Mr. Page had their doubts: \u201cWe expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201dThere was a crucial need for \u201ca competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm,\u201d and Google was set to be that ivory tower internet tool. Until, that is, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page were swept up by the entrepreneurism pervasive to Stanford \u2014 a meeting with a professor led to a meeting with an investor, who wrote a $100,000 check before Google was even a company. In 1999, Google announced a $25 million investment of venture capital while insisting nothing had changed. When Mr. Brin was asked by reporters how Google planned to make money, he replied, \u201cOur goal is to maximize the search experience, not maximize the revenues from search.\u201dSeven years later, Mr. Zuckerberg, too, had succumbed to Silicon Valley venture capital, but he seemed to regret it. \u201cIf I were starting now,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2011, \u201cI just would have stayed in Boston, I think,\u201d before adding: \u201cThere are aspects of the culture out here where I think it still is a little bit short-term focused in a way that bothers me. You know, whether it\u2019s like people who want to start companies to start a company, not knowing what they like, I don\u2019t know, to, like, flip it.\u201dUltimately, however, the founders of Google and Facebook faced a day of reckoning. Investors hadn\u2019t signed on for a charity, and they demanded accountability. In the end, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page agreed under pressure to display advertising alongside search results and eventually to allow an outside chief executive, Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to include ads within the news feed and transferred a favorite programmer to the mobile-advertising business, telling him, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fun to build a billion-dollar business in six months?\u201dTurns out that there were billion-dollar fortunes to be made by exploiting the foggy relationship between the public and tech companies. We all knew there was no such thing as a free lunch, an insight memorably encapsulated in 2010 by a commenter to the website MetaFilter, as, \u201cIf you are not paying for it, you\u2019re not the customer; you\u2019re the product being sold.\u201d But, really, how can you tell? So much of what is happening between the public and Silicon Valley is out of view \u2014 algorithms written and controlled by wizards who are able to extract value from your identity in ways you could never do for yourself.Eliza understood nothing, in truth, and could never reach any shared insight with a \u201cpatient.\u201d Eliza mechanically responded to whatever appeared on the screen. A typical therapy session quickly devolved into a Monty Python sketch. (Patient: You are not very aggressive, but I think you don\u2019t want me to notice that. Eliza: What makes you think I am not very aggressive? Patient: You don\u2019t argue with me. Eliza: Why do you think I don\u2019t argue with you? Patient: You are afraid of me. Eliza: Does it please you to believe I am afraid of you?)Imagine Mr. Weizenbaum\u2019s surprise when his secretary looked up from her computer and interrupted her exchanges with Eliza to say to him, \u201cWould you mind leaving the room, please?\u201d She wanted privacy for a conversation with a machine! Mr. Weizenbaum, appalled, suddenly saw the potential for mischief by programmers who could manipulate computers and potentially the rest of us. He soon switched gears and devoted his remaining years to protesting what he considered the amorality of his computer science peers, frequently referring to his experiences as a young refugee from Nazi Germany.In his epic anti-A.I. work from the mid-1970s, \u201cComputer Power and Human Reason,\u201d Mr. Weizenbaum described the scene at computer labs. \u201cBright young men of disheveled appearance, often with sunken glowing eyes, can be seen sitting at computer consoles, their arms tensed and waiting to fire their fingers, already poised to strike, at the buttons and keys on which their attention seems to be as riveted as a gambler\u2019s on the rolling dice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey exist, at least when so engaged, only through and for the computers. These are computer bums, compulsive programmers.\u201dHe was concerned about them as young students lacking perspective about life and was worried that these troubled souls could be our new leaders. Neither Mr. Weizenbaum nor Mr. McCarthy mentioned, though it was hard to miss, that this ascendant generation were nearly all white men with a strong preference for people just like themselves. In a word, they were incorrigible, accustomed to total control of what appeared on their screens. \u201cNo playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful,\u201d Mr. Weizenbaum wrote, \u201chas ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or a field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.\u201dWelcome to Silicon Valley, 2017.As Mr. Weizenbaum feared, the current tech leaders have discovered that people trust computers and have licked their lips at the possibilities. The examples of Silicon Valley manipulation are too legion to list: push notifications, surge pricing, recommended friends, suggested films, people who bought this also bought that. Early on, Facebook realized there was a hurdle to getting people to stay logged on. \u201cWe came upon this magic number that you needed to find 10 friends,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg recalled in 2011. \u201cAnd once you had 10 friends, you had enough content in your newsfeed that there would just be stuff on a good enough interval where it would be worth coming back to the site.\u201d Facebook would design its site for new arrivals so that it was all about finding people to \u201cfriend.\u201dThe 10 friends rule is an example of a favored manipulation of tech companies, the network effect. People will use your service \u2014 as lame as it may be \u2014 if others use your service. This was tautological reasoning that nonetheless proved true: If everyone is on Facebook, then everyone is on Facebook. You need to do whatever it takes to keep people logging in, and if rivals emerge, they must be crushed or, if stubbornly resilient, acquired.Growth becomes the overriding motivation \u2014 something treasured for its own sake, not for anything it brings to the world. Facebook and Google can point to a greater utility that comes from being the central repository of all people, all information, but such market dominance has obvious drawbacks, and not just the lack of competition. As we\u2019ve seen, the extreme concentration of wealth and power is a threat to our democracy by making some people and companies unaccountable.In addition to their power, tech companies have a tool that other powerful industries don\u2019t: the generally benign feelings of the public. To oppose Silicon Valley can appear to be opposing progress, even if progress has been defined as online monopolies; propaganda that distorts elections; driverless cars and trucks that threaten to erase the jobs of millions of people; the Uberization of work life, where each of us must fend for ourselves in a pitiless market.As is becoming obvious, these companies do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. We need greater regulation, even if it impedes the introduction of new services. If we can\u2019t stop their proposals \u2014 if we can\u2019t say that driverless cars may not be a worthy goal, to give just one example \u2014 then are we in control of our society? We need to break up these online monopolies because if a few people make the decisions about how we communicate, shop, learn the news, again, do we control our own society?Out of curiosity, the other day I searched \u201ccellphones\u201d on Google. Before finding even a mildly questioning article about cellphones, I paged down through ads for phones and lists of phones for sale, guides to buying phones and maps with directions to stores that sell phones, some 20 results in total. Somewhere, a pair of idealistic former graduate students must be saying: \u201cSee! I told you so!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Said to Order Luxembourg to Collect Back Taxes From Amazon", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials will order Luxembourg to collect back taxes from the online retail giant Amazon, a source with knowledge of the decision said Tuesday, the latest in a series of moves where Brussels has sought to flex its regulatory muscle over Silicon Valley.It was not clear how much Luxembourg would be ordered to reclaim, according to the source, who did not want to be identified discussing information that was not yet public. Officials in Luxembourg and the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, declined to comment.The actions have highlighted the heightened scrutiny faced by low-tax nations in the European Union. Those countries, critics argue, help multinationals funnel revenues from larger markets in order to lower their overall tax bill. Such behavior has infuriated larger countries like France, whose budgets have been squeezed in recent years.At the time, the commission said that, in a deal struck in 2003, authorities in Luxembourg had conferred \u201can advantage on Amazon.\u201d The commission added that the \u201cadvantage is obtained every year and ongoing,\u201d and that it \u201cis also granted in a selective manner.\u201dAmazon does business across the 28-nation bloc, but lists its European headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000. The agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg effectively capped the amount of tax Amazon paid, and relied on a method called transfer pricing, according to the commission.Transfer pricing has long been used by multinational companies to assign profits to different units, depending on factors like their role in the overall business and assets. But, according to the commission, these rules are harder to apply for technology companies, because their assets, like intellectual property, are intangible.European regulators have claimed that Amazon sent most of its European revenue from one unit in Luxembourg to a separate subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax in the country. As a result, it was able to reduce the profit it generated from its European operations and cut its tax bill, the commission said.It is not illegal in the European Union for countries to try to lure businesses with low tax rates. But offering special deals to companies that are not available to their competitors can amount to what is known as illegal state aid.Both Amazon and Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry have previously denied that the online retail giant received special tax treatment or benefits.Amazon has already been in the commission\u2019s cross hairs this year for unfair competition.Efforts to curb multinationals from dodging tax have risen in prominence in recent months.Last month, the European Union began considering new proposals broadly aimed at tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.The prominence of Luxembourg has put Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in an awkward position: his role includes oversight of the investigations yet his critics accuse him of having helped turn Luxembourg into a tax haven during his nearly two decades leading that country.Advertisement"}

The combined company would have manufactured coatings, resins and other industrial chemicals and employed more than 32,000 people worldwide.Huntsman was founded in 1970 by Jon M.

{"Headline": "Why Tech Is Starting to Make Me Uneasy", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s gadget season in the tech world. Think of it like New York Fashion Week, untucked white-man edition.But despite the baubles and billion-dollar office parks, I\u2019m really not feeling it this year. The technology industry is still exciting; it still packs the capacity for surprise. But where the surprise once felt like Christmas morning, it\u2019s now like the entering-the-darkened-basement scene of a horror movie.Technology has crossed over to the dark side. It\u2019s coming for you; it\u2019s coming for us all, and we may not survive its advance.I\u2019ve been covering tech for nearly 20 years; for the past three, since I inherited the State of the Art column from David Pogue, I\u2019ve explored for The New York Times how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future.Not only am I lucky enough to have my dream job, but it\u2019s perfectly timed, too. In the years that I\u2019ve written the column, the technology business has swallowed the world, becoming by far the largest and most consequential industry on the globe. Silicon Valley today is like Wall Street in the 1980s, or the defense industry in the 1950s: enjoying gargantuan growth and shaping much of the rest of the rest of the economy, not to mention art, culture, politics, education and healthcare.So why am I feeling so bad about tech?Well, who isn\u2019t, right? Look around you. It\u2019s difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when smartphones and social networks might be ruining the world. The technologies we were most excited about 10 years ago are now implicated in just about every catastrophe of the day. (See how Russian propagandists used Facebook and Twitter to inject false narratives into the news media last year.)These companies are not evil; they\u2019re all led and staffed by smart, well-meaning people who believe that technology can radically improve the world. But as I argue in the series, we have not, as a society, come to grips with the scope of their control over our lives. And we don\u2019t have many good ways to limit it, if we decided that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do.A lot of these worries aren\u2019t new. Though Silicon Valley runs on heedless optimism, much of The Times\u2019s coverage has long been properly skeptical and critical of the implications of new tech. Consider the evil of \u201crevenge porn,\u201d or the rise in accidents caused by drivers looking at their phones. I\u2019ve shared other fears: In 2008, I wrote a book predicting that the internet would lead us into a \u201cpost-fact\u201d world.Still, until this year, the problems caused by tech felt manageable \u2014 bumps on the road to a better tomorrow that we\u2019d eventually figure out. I managed to retain the capacity to be viscerally excited by tech, to instantly fall for its potential and possibilities. And I bought into it personally. You should see my house: I\u2019ve outfitted it with every kind of doodad you can imagine, including cameras that record everything we do, lights that switch on by voice, a toilet you have to plug in and, once, an electronic trashcan. (Manual is better, trust me.) There\u2019s a lot about it I now can\u2019t live without; every time I want to snap a picture of my kids, which is maybe five times an hour, I\u2019m grateful for the smartphone.And yet now it all comes freighted with worry. That\u2019s what\u2019s different. In 2007, when Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone, just about everyone greeted the new device as an unalloyed good. I was one of them. Here was a genuinely new thing that would Make Your Life Better, we all thought: It would be convenient, it would be fun, it wasn\u2019t serious or dangerous or globe-shattering. That\u2019s no longer true.The State of the Art, today, is a bag of mixed emotions. Tech might improve everything. And it\u2019s probably also terrible in ways we\u2019re only just starting to understand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It Takes a Foot Thief", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBUQUERQUE \u2014 The meeting involved elements worthy of a thriller: detailed coordinates for a site in the wilds of northern New Mexico, the promise of seeing long-hidden spoils from an act of unsolved political sabotage, and a briefing on the stealthy operative who would be journeying in by foot to talk with me.I arrived early at the meeting spot, pulling up in my mud-splattered Toyota truck, and went over some notes I had compiled. It was nearly dusk, that spellbinding window of time when light starts to dance over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Finally, Mr. Eyre appeared, and we trekked together to a forest clearing.\u201cAsk him if you can hold the foot,\u201d Mr. Eyre, 48, urged me, cracking a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s an impressive piece of metal.\u201dThe foot thief described in detail how he and a comrade had hiked miles to the village of Alcalde and sawed the foot off the statue one wintry night in 1997 \u2014 an attempt to lambaste the celebrations of the Spanish conquest 400 years earlier by O\u00f1ate and his men.After all, O\u00f1ate\u2019s tactics were considered extreme, even by that era\u2019s standards. In 1599, they included amputating a foot from each of more than 20 male captives from Acoma Pueblo. The viceroy in Mexico City forced O\u00f1ate to resign as governor of New Mexico, and the conquistador was put on trial and found guilty of excesses. O\u00f1ate never returned to the land he conquered.In my clandestine interview, the foot thief told me that he thought his act of sabotage in the 1990s would focus attention on O\u00f1ate\u2019s atrocities. Curiously, however, no one seemed to even notice the amputation at first, including the statue\u2019s caretakers. So the foot surgeons, calling themselves Friends of Acoma, sent letters and photographs to local newspapers describing what they had done, and why.That did the trick. A firestorm ensued, triggering a fierce debate in New Mexico at the time over symbols of the Spanish conquest. The theft of O\u00f1ate\u2019s foot resonated with land activists and scholars, and even in the writings of poets like Mart\u00edn Espada.I ended up meeting twice with the person who had purloined O\u00f1ate\u2019s foot, each time at some place arranged by Mr. Eyre. Our discussions focused largely on the polarizing dismemberment of the statue, but they also ranged widely over the history of indigenous peoples in the Americas.The foot thief, who asked that I not identify him and his co-cutter for fear of legal action, was curious to hear about my travels in the Brazilian Amazon. There I had reported on other mysteries \u2014 such as the land carvings and megaliths revealed by deforestation, suggesting that the world\u2019s largest river basin had supported highly populated, complex societies before the arrival of Europeans.We discussed books like Charles C. Mann\u2019s \u201c1491,\u201d about the Americas before Columbus, and the complexities of New Mexico\u2019s own colonial history, which got me thinking about the myths I grew up listening to about the origins of this part of the country.Celebrations of the Spanish conquest were all around me when I was a kid in northern New Mexico. Near the village of Villanueva, for instance, historical markers proudly described the route of 16th-century conquistadors like Antonio de Espejo and Francisco S\u00e1nchez, also called El Chamuscado (roughly translated as Redbeard).Each year in Santa Fe, a group called \u201cLos Caballeros de Vargas\u201d still puts on a re-enactment of the so-called \u201cpeaceful resettlement\u201d of New Mexico in 1692, a development in a drawn-out re-conquestthat historians now describe as involving executions and warfare.The mascot at my alma mater, West Las Vegas High School, was \u201cThe Don,\u201d the honorific title used in Spain and the New World for figures like Don Juan de O\u00f1ate. The severing of O\u00f1ate\u2019s foot, along with a broader questioning by Native Americans of the pageantry promoting the conquest, is now obliging Hispanic New Mexicans to examine some of the gruesomeness of our ancestors\u2019 arrival in these lands.After the uproar over the vandalism of the statue in 1997 had ebbed, the foot thief went dark. But he reappeared recently, motivated in part, he told me, by the controversy elsewhere in the United States over Confederate statues.He contacted Mr. Eyre, one of the country\u2019s best-known Native American filmmakers, who got in touch with Jack Healy, a New York Times colleague based in Colorado, who then passed along Mr. Eyre\u2019s phone number to me.I hope to see Jack soon and buy him a cold beer for sharing the treasured tip that allowed me to hold O\u00f1ate\u2019s heavy foot in my hands.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Amazon Moves In, Demand for Warehouse Space Climbs", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetFor the modest warehouse, this is a golden age.Boxy, unadorned and often overlooked, these properties are suddenly in hot demand in many parts of the country, thanks in part to a rise in e-commerce as consumer shopping habits move online. Retailers like Amazon and Walmart are snapping up space once reserved for makers of office furniture and home flooring.As developers try to catch up, they are considering some unusual solutions, like constructing multistory warehouses and demolishing struggling malls to make way for sprawling industrial properties.\u201cThis is the best I\u2019ve seen it in my 35-year career,\u201d said Craig S. Meyer, president of the logistics and industrial services group for the Americas at the commercial real estate company JLL.There is relatively little in the way of available warehouse space for rent in many metropolitan regions, especially along the coasts, where land is at a premium. Nationwide, the vacancy rate stood at 5.2 percent at the end of September, lower than the average rate of 8.1 percent over the previous decade, according to JLL. Asking rental rates hit a high of $5.40 per square foot this fall.Just outside of Cincinnati, two real estate development companies, Al. Neyer and the Hillwood Development Company, recently put the finishing touches on a development called the Hebron Logistics Center. Located on a 49-acre property a few miles from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Ky., the project includes a pair of huge buildings, the larger of which covers more than 589,000 square feet \u2014 the equivalent of about 10 football fields \u2014 and has 36-foot-high ceilings. The smaller structure measures around 209,500 square feet.Both buildings, built on speculation that tenants will emerge, are vacant. The developers are betting that with the Cincinnati-area warehouse vacancy rate standing at 3.1 percent as of September, according to JLL\u2019s data, tenants will be eager to move in. The site\u2019s proximity to the airport and the area\u2019s highway network could be draws for tenants, too.\u201cCincinnati has historically had low vacancy rates,\u201d said Molly North, chief executive at Al. Neyer. \u201cCertainly, from a developer\u2019s perspective, this calls for more supply. I think it\u2019s also an indication that, as developers, we haven\u2019t kept up with demand in the market.\u201dBefore the project in Hebron, Al. Neyer had not developed a warehouse property in the Cincinnati area since 2007, according to Ms. North. As the economy softened, leasing that development was a challenge. The company focused on other real estate projects instead.Now, the company wants back in the market. Even as they try to lease the Hebron project, Al. Neyer and Hillwood have bought another parcel close to the region\u2019s airport and plan to build two more buildings with 1.7 million square feet between them. Construction on the first building is set to begin next April.\u201cWe already liked the market before that,\u201d said Kurt Nelson, senior vice president at Hillwood. \u201cBut I think it just adds another piece, another opportunity.\u201dAmazon is having an outsize effect on warehouse developers. By the end of the year, Amazon will rent an estimated 114 million square feet of warehouse space, up from about nine million in 2009, according to a June note from Jonathan Petersen, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies who follows industrial property companies.But Amazon faces some competition for warehouse space. Walmart, for example, has increased the number of large distribution centers that support its online sales. And e-commerce operations require three times the amount of warehouse space that brick-and-mortar stores need, analysts say, to guarantee that inventory is on hand and returns can be processed. That means companies with online shopping platforms are going to be on the hunt.\u201cThe last thing that caused a big difference, and this is more macro, was just the growth in trade, the growth in port markets and the move toward distribution and warehousing along the coasts,\u201d Mr. Petersen said in an interview. \u201cThen out of nowhere, you have this e-commerce trend. That continues to boost the sector and drive growth.\u201dThis year, developers are expected to build about 225 million new square feet of warehouse space, according to JLL, about the same as last year\u2019s tally and more than double the 10-year average of 120 million square feet.One challenge for many builders is finding development sites in or close to dense, built-up cities, where land is often scarce. E-commerce companies need such parcels to guarantee they can quickly dispatch orders to homes and businesses.Prologis, a San Francisco-based real estate investment trust that owns 380 million square feet of industrial property in the United States, is trying to solve the land riddle by constructing modern multistory warehouses \u2014 at least in some markets. These types of properties are not uncommon in cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo, but they are nonexistent here. A property Prologis is building in Seattle will be the first contemporary multistory warehouse in the United States, according to the company.The building, called Prologis Georgetown Crossroads and located about four miles south of downtown Seattle, will span 590,000 square feet over three levels. When complete, it will have two floors designated for product fulfillment. A ramp will wind around one side of the building, allowing trucks to drive to the second floor, pick up or drop off goods and then leave in an efficient manner. The top level could host offices or even a light manufacturing operation.Multistory warehouses are unproven in the United States, but potential tenants for the Seattle property have been receptive to the idea, said Larry Harmsen, chief operating officer for the Americas at Prologis. The company also plans to develop such a property in San Francisco. \u201cThey\u2019re not just crazy experiments,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do these everywhere. These really only work in high-density, highly land-constrained environments,\u201d Mr. Harmsen said. \u201cThe land economics have to be high enough.\u201dThe boom in warehouses could even spell the end for long-struggling retail properties. In Frackville, Pa., about 60 miles northeast of Harrisburg, the state capital, the real estate company NorthPoint Development believes industrial buildings are a better use than a moribund mall.NorthPoint wants to demolish the mostly empty 800,000-square-foot Schuylkill Mall in Frackville, replacing the retail property with two new warehouses that will have more than 1.2 million square feet between them, according to Brian Hansbury, vice president at the Schuylkill Economic Development Corporation.Schuylkill Mall opened in 1980 and once had four anchor retail tenants, including a now-closed Sears and a Hess\u2019s. But the mall has been in decline for years, hurt in part by the rise of online retailers, according to Mr. Hansbury. Later this year, NorthPoint will demolish the property, clearing the land for the warehouses it wants to build, he said.Mr. Hansbury thinks the larger of the two buildings planned for the property could work as an e-commerce distribution center. It would be ironic, of course, if an e-commerce company, the type of which helped make the mall obsolete, ended up with an operation on the site.\u201cIt really is kind of a full circle development that\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Hansbury said. \u201cI can see why some people would be disappointed that they no longer have a mall, but I think what we\u2019re left with might even be better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hearing Amazon\u2019s Footsteps, the Health Care Industry Shudders", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 With little more than a whiff of Amazon\u2019s interest in a new business, the company can crater the stocks of potential competitors, prompting them to consider bold acquisitions and other drastic measures in response. Just ask companies in the home improvement, meal-kit and grocery businesses.The likelihood of Amazon\u2019s eventually getting into the pharmacy business is high, several analysts and a former employee said. But it is not clear when it will make that move or how aggressive it intends to be.Brian Tanquilut, an analyst for Jefferies, noted that the company acquired many of the wholesale pharmacy licenses between fall of last year and early this year, around when the company started selling medical supplies to businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not evidence of a retail entry into the pharmacy business,\u201d he said.An Amazon spokeswoman, Lori Torgerson, refused to comment on \u201crumors or speculation\u201d about Amazon entering the pharmacy business, but she shared a statement that suggested other motivations for the paperwork. \u201cWholesale licenses are required for Amazon Business to sell professional-use only medical devices in certain states,\u201d she said.There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business. Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions.\u201cThe pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole,\u201d he said.While Mr. Ladd said he isn\u2019t privy to the company\u2019s current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried. \u201cMy advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care,\u201d he said.If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said.The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront. To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state \u2014 a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cThey can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business,\u201d said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners.She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business.The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers. Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason. Amazon\u2019s recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies.\u201cA large part of the infrastructure is already there,\u201d said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo.In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers. \u201cWe certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator,\u201d he said.If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers.This would be far more complex. It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one. Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use. The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon.Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way. The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs.Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications.No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is \u201cclearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way.\u201dBut while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right. \u201cIt is just a sensitive topic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes.\u201dFollow Nick Wingfield on Twitter @nickwingfieldAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s New Gadgets Come With a Big Helping of A.I.", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s unveiling of new smartphones, smart speakers and other gadgets had all the makings of a typical technology product launch: a fawning crowd of superfans, skeptical journalists, slick product videos, not-so-subtle jabs at the competition, and overly romanticized descriptions of design choices, colors and materials.But one nagging question lingered for Google, which makes nearly all of its money from selling online advertisements: Is it finally serious about making devices?On Wednesday, Google did its best to demonstrate its commitment. It introduced two new Pixel smartphones, Google Home speakers both small and large, a laptop running the company\u2019s Chrome software, a new virtual reality headset and wireless headphones.But Google\u2019s pitch for why its hardware is different had little to do with the hardware itself.Unlike the way an Apple event is conducted \u2014 usually chock-full of talk about chip speeds and screen resolutions \u2014 Google didn\u2019t spend much time on product specifications. Instead, its focus was on artificial intelligence. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, spent the first 10 minutes explaining how artificial intelligence was helping Google Maps and its translations.Mr. Pichai said that as an \u201cA.I. first\u201d company, this is a \u201cunique moment in time\u201d for Google to combine hardware, software and artificial intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s radically rethinking how computing should work,\u201d he said.Google executives said it has been getting harder to find new hardware breakthroughs like bigger and better screens, but they believe significant improvements will come from artificial intelligence software that is developing at a faster clip than physical components.Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president of hardware, compared the company\u2019s strategy for building devices to search and email. Google was not the first search engine and Gmail was hardly the first free web-based email provider \u2014 but both services reimagined what those products should do.On Wednesday, Google demonstrated how every hardware product had received an A.I. makeover. The Pixel smartphones come with an image-recognition app called Lens that can help users find information just by pointing a camera at a movie poster or an ad. The new \u201csmart speaker\u201d uses artificial intelligence to adjust its sound for the layout of a room. And new wireless headphones allow for instant translation of different languages.The question of Google\u2019s commitment to hardware is a testament to the challenges of competing against devices made by Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Most other companies have found it hard to turn a profit in that product fight, and a flop can follow a company around for years \u2014 both in money and reputation lost.It is also a recognition of Google\u2019s history of fits and starts with devices. The company once acquired Motorola, only to sell it a few years later to Lenovo. It bought Nest and Dropcam, but the introduction of new products from those home device companies seemed to stagnate after they joined Google, now operating under the parent company, Alphabet.Whether Google\u2019s device push sticks over the long haul remains to be seen, but its checkbook for hardware is still open.The deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval, early next year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose Situation", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But so what? Hasn\u2019t that always been the case?As the men who run Silicon Valley will be the first to tell you, a company\u2019s size doesn\u2019t matter here. For every lumbering Goliath, there are always one or two smarter, faster Davids just now starting up in some fabled garage, getting ready to slay the giants when they least expect it.Well, maybe not this time.The technology industry is now a playground for giants. Where 10 or 20 years ago we looked to start-ups as a font of future wonders, today the energy and momentum have shifted almost completely to the big guys. In addition to the many platforms they own already, one or more of the Five are on their way to owning artificial intelligence, voice assistants, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, home automation, and every other cool and crazy thing that will rule tomorrow.The best start-ups keep being scooped up by the big guys (see Instagram and WhatsApp, owned by Facebook). Those that escape face merciless, sometimes unfair competition (their innovations copied, their projects litigated against). And even when the start-ups succeed, the Five still win.Because today\u2019s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don\u2019t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition \u2014 they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.The small guys won\u2019t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don\u2019t have the whole game won.They said the Five\u2019s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five\u2019s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren\u2019t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.\u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019d say it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, \u2018Why won\u2019t Microsoft do your business?\u2019 Then six years later it was, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Google do it?\u2019 Now it\u2019s a combination of why can\u2019t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?\u201dMr. Levin\u2019s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller\u2019s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day\u2019s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.IAC\u2019s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie\u2019s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five \u2014 both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that\u2019s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys \u2014 for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms \u2014 because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.\u201cWe think that a smart voice provider will say, \u2018If I want to win at all costs, we\u2019ll go get the very best partner\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s us,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn\u2019t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It\u2019s not betting on their demise; rather, it\u2019s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.IAC\u2019s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. \u201cI think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia \u2014 whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.\u201cI\u2019m mixed as it relates to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers \u2014 and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.\u201dBut like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here\u2019s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump Imitating Fiction? Or Is Fiction Imitating Trump?", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook NewsLONDON \u2014 A mercurial American president is about to launch a nuclear war against North Korea after exchanging childish taunts with its dictator, prompting two senior aides to hatch a plot to assassinate the president.Yet for all of its spooky prescience at anticipating the headlines, critics \u2014 not least among them some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters \u2014 have accused Mr. Freedland of writing a morally repugnant literary recipe book for murder.The book appears to be part of a growing cultural current of imagined assassinations of the president by liberal artists, directors and writers, which Mr. Freedland argues is predicated on a need for \u201ccatharsis\u201d and revolt against a world turned upside-down rather than any murderous intent.And this summer a Shakespeare in the Park production of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d in New York drew the opprobrium of Republicans for depicting a Caesar with overcoiffed strawberry blond hair who gets stabbed to death by a knife.\u201cThe commercial view among publishers seems to be that people are living it and haven\u2019t got the head space for reading it,\u201d Mr. Geller said. \u201cIt is a lack of courage and imagination.\u201dThe moral conundrum of the book is expressed by its heroine, Maggie Costello, a legal counsel and liberal do-gooder from the previous administration, who discovers the assassination plot, and tries to piece the clues together to stop it, even as she grapples with how to be on the right side of history.\u201cNo matter how much you hated this man and, my God, there was every reason to hate him, this, surely, was not the way to get rid of him,\u201d she reflects. \u201cYou\u2019d be destroying democracy in order to save it.\u201d\u201cNow as then, all the old verities seem shaken, and there\u2019s a sense you can\u2019t trust authority,\u201d Mr. Freedland said. \u201cPeople want a guide rail to hang onto, which fiction can provide.\u201dThe book moves along quickly and Mr. Freedland, a former Washington correspondent who covered the Clinton White House and the 2016 election, has a visceral feel for the vanity, codes and preoccupations of the capital.Aides shave their beards when they hear the new president doesn\u2019t trust men with facial hair. Emails are carefully written to avoid later exposure. A White House official flicks a button that fogs up an office window in the situation room, a technical innovation of the real White House\u2019s nerve center.When the ending arrives, however, it does so with jarring implausibility while the story sometimes falls flat, underlining the challenge of satirizing a president whose daily outrages have made him immune to parody. A tweet from the fictional president suggesting a 16-year-old television contest winner should \u201cperform a private show for me @WhiteHouse\u201d doesn\u2019t provide much of a jolt when the real one has boasted about grabbing women\u2019s genitals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Know Before Buying an Air Purifier to Clear Wildfire Smoke", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by(This article was updated July 31, 2018.)As wildfires continue to rage in Northern California, residents will probably have to deal with smoke and ash for weeks or even months. If that\u2019s you, you may be concerned about the long-term health risks of breathing the smoke that remains, and looking for ways to protect yourself or your family.However, the E.P.A. also suggests that more vulnerable populations (children, older people, pregnant women and people with asthma or cardiovascular disease) may be more susceptible to the health hazards of wildfire smoke.Of course, pollutants and the health hazards that come with them aren\u2019t limited to areas exposed to wildfire smoke. We all breathe in harmful particulates.Studies that definitively link air purifiers to long-term health benefits are rare, because long-term health is affected by multiple factors. (This is also why air purifiers may not be marketed as medical devices in the United States.)However, Mr. Heffernan explained, \u201cIt is absolutely, unequivocally true that particulate pollution does impact health.\u201dTo put it simply, they draw in polluted air, trap the particles, then blow out clean air.In order to be HEPA certified, air filters have to remove 99.97 percent of particles that are exactly 0.3 microns in diameter \u2014 a size that\u2019s especially difficult to filter mechanically. That is also close to the size of wildfire smoke particles, which are mostly in the 0.4 to 0.7 micron range, according to the E.P.A. HEPA filters remove much larger and much smaller particles, as well. Some of the models Wirecutter has tested were able to remove virtually all particles as small as 0.01 micron, one-thirtieth the HEPA standard.Again, while the long-term effects of short-term smoke exposure may be low, any kind of particle pollution can still affect our health, and that pollution is more concentrated indoors \u2014 meaning nearly all of us can benefit from cleaner air.\u201cMost of us spend a lot of time indoors,\u201d Mr. Heffernan said. \u201cAnd indoor air is more polluted than outdoor air. It kind of comes down to what we have in our homes: pets, rugs, furniture that traps dust. And many homes are not terribly well ventilated.\u201dEspecially if you\u2019re older or have asthma or other respiratory conditions, you may want to consider an air purifier. All of the HEPA-certified models Mr. Heffernan tested with his colleague John Holecek were effective at removing particulate pollution.For homes in smoke-prone areas, including those near wildfire-affected areas, Heffernan suggested running the purifier on high for an hour, then turning it down to medium or low, which should keep the amount of smoke in your home to a minimum.When choosing an air purifier, it\u2019s important to ensure first that the purifier is indeed HEPA certified; it\u2019ll usually be listed as \u201ctrue HEPA.\u201d You\u2019ll also want a model with a tight seal around the filter. \u201cIf it\u2019s not well sealed, air is going to flow around the edges,\u201d Mr. Heffernan said. \u201cIf it\u2019s letting dirty air around the edges, you\u2019re not getting the full effect.\u201dSome models may list a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) rating. This measures the volume of air that will pass through the unit, telling you how efficiently the model will work depending on the size of the room. Mr. Heffernan suggested looking for a CADR rating of at least 200 or more for tobacco smoke (ratings are also given for dust and pollen). That means the unit effectively delivers the equivalent of 200 cubic feet of pure air per minute to a smoky room.These models are often recommended for smaller rooms of about 300 square feet, and they will cycle the air four to five times per hour in a room that size, ensuring that pollutants are filtered quickly. This isn\u2019t to say a model with a 200 CADR rating won\u2019t work in a larger room, but it will work more slowly.If you\u2019re looking for a more cost-effective solution, you can also upgrade your existing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system to improve air quality.Wirecutter recommends MERV 12 or equivalent filters. However, Mr. Heffernan cautions, these can strain older HVAC systems by restricting the airflow as they become clogged with captured particles. Manufacturers typically recommend replacing filters every three months, Mr. Heffernan says, but when particulate pollution is high, as during wildfires, they can become clogged in less than half that time.Many purifiers claim to reduce VOCs, or volatile organic compounds, using an activated charcoal filter. \u201cVery few of them actually do,\u201d Mr. Heffernan added. \u201cIt comes down to the mass of the activated charcoal filter.\u201d In order to be effective, the activated charcoal filter would have to be a minimum of five pounds to have any statistically significant effect, he said. Most contain a tiny fraction of that.Maintenance of your air purifier should be minimal. Most HEPA filters are designed to run continuously for a year, though many manufacturers recommend checking them every six months. If there\u2019s a fair amount of buildup on your filter, or you just want peace of mind, simply replace it.Beyond purifying your air, there are additional precautions to take if you live in a smoke-adjacent area or you\u2019re concerned about pollutants.Many of these tips are common sense: Keep your windows closed, and avoid spending too much time outdoors to keep from bringing particulates into your home.\u201cI would also recommend simple tasks, like washing your sheets and pillowcases. You don\u2019t want to spend eight to 10 hours on sheets filled with smoke,\u201d Mr. Heffernan said. And if you\u2019re planning to vacuum, remember that vacuuming can also kick up dust and smoke that has settled, so mopping may be a better approach.\u201cSo if you\u2019re going to be outside and you want a mask, you need one of these certified masks,\u201d Mr. Heffernan said. \u201cA paper one won\u2019t do any harm, but it shouldn\u2019t give you a false sense of security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A few receipts here, a bank statement there, and someone has enough information to apply for a credit card or a loan in your name.The best way to go is using a cross-cut shredder, which slices paper two ways into small ribbons rather than long straight ones, which can be pieced back together like a puzzle by (very patient) nefarious actors.Even if you have a dedicated home office, working from home means cables all over (or under) your desk. Charging cables, keyboard and mouse cables, monitor cables, external hard drives and more. The solution? Velcro cable ties! They\u2019re easy to remove and reapply whenever you need to move things around.Working from home often means peace and quiet (if you don\u2019t have kids or pets interrupting you), but it also means checking in with the office occasionally via conference call or video chat. For those moments, you\u2019ll need a solid USB headset with a good microphone so everyone at the office can hear you and good enough audio quality so you can hear them.When the couch calls, just remember not to keep your laptop on your lap for too long. Some models can get hot enough to burn, and even if yours doesn\u2019t, it can make you clammy and uncomfortable. Grab a lap desk instead: You get a stable work space for your laptop, and your legs get to breathe.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump\u2019s other leading antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, was recently confirmed to lead competition cases at the Justice Department.The timing of the official nominations is unclear. They will be reviewed by Congress but are expected to be approved.Under Mr. Simons, who led the competition bureau of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration, the agency is expected take a free-markets and conservative approach to antitrust issues, maintaining decades-long interpretations of competition laws that put consumer welfare and the efficiencies of markets at the center of enforcement actions and merger reviews.Amazon\u2019s $4.3 billion purchase of Whole Foods was quickly approved by the F.T.C. in August, largely because of ample competition in the grocery foods market.But some antitrust academics and politicians criticized the fast review, saying the government needed to look more broadly at whether Amazon\u2019s ability to take losses and leverage other parts of its businesses harmed competition.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, has called on the agency to reopen an antitrust investigation into Google that was closed in 2013, saying new evidence from a parallel investigation in Europe warrants a new look. Stephen K. Bannon, the former senior adviser to Mr. Trump, has called Google a utility-like monopoly that needs antitrust scrutiny.Mr. Simons comes from the Washington offices of the law firm Paul Weiss, where he served as a partner representing big tech clients including Microsoft and Sony in a $4 billion acquisition of patents from Nortel Networks. He also represented Mastercard in antitrust class-action cases against the credit card company in federal court. But like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for corporate watchdog roles, Mr. Simons has been in and out of the private and public sector for years.Since the election, moderate Democrats and Republicans have trained their focus on corporate consolidation. The new climate, antitrust experts say, makes it difficult to predict how Mr. Simons will act.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting so long for leadership at the agencies, we are out of the speculation business until we see some enforcement under the new antitrust chiefs,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.Jeffrey Chester, head of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, a group that has pushed for online privacy regulations and stronger competition enforcement, said the agency was \u201cat a critical turning point about whether it can be relevant at all protecting consumers in the 21st century.\u201d\u201cIt has been unable to effectively address the dramatic loss of privacy Americans face online,\u201d he added. \u201cThe commission has also failed to effectively tackle the growing power of the major internet companies, especially Google and Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Female Power!", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuffering Sappho, Batman, you\u2019re such a square! That\u2019s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman, the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens, there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso, which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. \u201cOn Paradise Island where we play many binding games,\u201d she says in an early comic while roping another woman, \u201cthis is considered the safest method of tying a girl\u2019s arms!\u201dIf nothing else, \u201cProfessor Marston\u201d is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France), something else the movies don\u2019t always like to admit. Occasionally, grandpa might have even visited a dusty, mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure.Ms. Robinson borrows Marston\u2019s theory, using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination, psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement, submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet, soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife, a frustrated academic, Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall, tart, brisk, essential), and soon includes a third, Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student, Olive cracks open the Marstons\u2019 marriage, but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared, liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic.Dr. Wertham saw cruelty in the Wonder Woman world, but Ms. Robinson sees deep, enduring love in its back story as well as freedom, including from rigid gender roles. Her version of the idealistic professor and his two wonder women, and the complex geometry that defined their relationship, may be a touch fuzzier than the actual story. Certainly the real Marston didn\u2019t have Mr. Evans\u2019s sleek matinee-idol looks. But it\u2019s a pleasurable fantasy, as well as a gentle, appealingly Utopian vision of a world in which men and women can slip from their traditional binds into new, excitingly freeing configurations. Those might be surprising, perhaps even a bit tight around the wrists but, as Ms. Robinson suggests, there are so many possibilities when you\u2019re given room to play.The real Marston was delightfully unbound. In 1937, Ms. Lepore writes in her book, he held a news conference to announce the coming Amazonian rule. The Washington Post ran with the story: \u201cNeglected Amazons to Rule Men in 1,000 Yrs., Says Psychologist.\u201d The Los Angeles Times went with the punchier \u201cFeminine Rule Declared Fact.\u201d \u201cThe next 100 years will see the beginning of an American matriarchy,\u201d Mr. Marston said (2037 here we come!). And \u201cin 1,000 years women will definitely rule this country.\u201d Believing women superior, he thought they had twice \u201cthe ability for love\u201d as men, which would allow them to conquer the world. It\u2019s a delicious idea although clearly we could use many more lassos.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

Both men worked in industries that put up with gross behavior from male executives for decades, and both now stand accused of lording their status over women who have stepped forward to say that the men sexually harassed or otherwise abused them.Mr. O\u2019Reilly, late of Fox News, and Mr. Weinstein, late of the Weinstein Company, share something else. They kept their alleged misconduct under wraps with the help of the nondisclosure agreements included as part of the numerous out-of-court settlements that allowed them to admit to no wrongdoing.The sums they paid their accusers bought them silence. A full, public airing did not come to be until those meddling reporters came along.Two months later, Fox News and its parent, 21st Century Fox, forced Mr. O\u2019Reilly out.But it is a reckoning long delayed. And a big reason for the delay has to do with the out-of-court settlements and the nondisclosure agreements that go with them.And it was a nondisclosure agreement that brought to a close the flurry of media attention that followed the lawsuit filed against Mr. O\u2019Reilly by the former Fox News producer Andrea Mackris in 2004. Her silence \u2014 along with agreeing to the public statement that there had been \u201cno wrongdoing whatsoever\u201d \u2014 went for about $9 million.Those are only the best known examples. The entertainment news and gossip archives are filled with reports of celebrity sexual harassment cases written in disappearing ink.\u201cMy duty as an attorney is to my client and to assist her and protect her and support her in what she thinks is best for her life,\u201d Ms. Allred told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think any woman should be sacrificed for the \u2018cause.\u2019\u201dFor a number of women, she said, a confidential settlement is the right outcome. \u201cSome clients want to protect their privacy \u2014 they don\u2019t want anybody to know,\u201d she said.In most cases, Ms. Allred said, if there is no confidentiality agreement, there is no shot at a settlement. And she disputed the notion that out-of-court settlements somehow let the alleged harassers off scot-free.\u201dIf the accused sexual harasser is paying my client $500,000, or $1 million or $2 million, that\u2019s not nuisance value,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an admission that the accused feels that he has risk and that he has done something that he should not have done.\u201dIn return for the $32 million he was said to have paid Ms. Wiehl, Mr. O\u2019Reilly bought more than her silence. As part of the deal, the Times reported, all text messages and other communications between them were destroyed, and he got an affidavit, signed by Ms. Wiehl, in which she attested that she had \u201cno claims\u201d regarding the allegations in her initial complaint.\u201cThe freedom to tell your story shouldn\u2019t be easily signed away,\u201d Ms. Lessin told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t cases where it\u2019s reasonable to use them, but they appear so frequently that it is a sign that women are being forced to sign away their rights to free speech.\u201dThat\u2019s a start.Jaclyn Peiser and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rex Tillerson Pays Secret Visit to U.S. Air Base in Afghanistan", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan \u2014 Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson made a secret two-hour visit to the main American air base in Afghanistan on Monday, arriving in a military transport plane to meet top Afghan officials inside a massive bunker.Nearly 20,000 military personnel, contractors and others live and work at the base, Bagram Airfield north of Kabul. Many were on high alert as the secretary arrived, fearing the kind of rocket or mortar attack that has become common.That top American officials must sneak into this country after 16 years of war, thousands of lives lost and hundreds of billions of dollars spent was testimony to the stalemate confronting the United States because of a stubborn and effective Taliban foe that is increasingly ascendant.Mr. Tillerson\u2019s visit was his first to Afghanistan as secretary of state, and like nearly every other top American official to visit over the previous two decades, he said the country\u2019s predicament was not nearly as dire as his own security precautions suggested.\u201cBut I think if you consider the current situation in Afghanistan, and we were talking about this a few minutes ago, and you look a few years in the past to what the circumstances were, Afghanistan has come quite a distance already in terms of creating a much more vibrant population, a much more vibrant government, education system, a larger economy,\u201d he said in a small windowless conference room during a hurried eight-minute news conference. \u201cSo there are opportunities to strengthen the foundations of a prosperous Afghanistan society.\u201dMr. Tillerson saw none of that hoped-for blooming.When the huge maw of the C-17 aircraft that he flew into Bagram opened, he was greeted by Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of United States operations in Afghanistan, along with a sizable contingent of soldiers and security guards.At the headquarters building, a former prison, Mr. Tillerson and General Nicholson met in another windowless room with Afghanistan\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani; its chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah; and its national security adviser, Hanif Atmar, as an armored truck and Humvee guarded outside.After the men sat down, Mr. Tillerson said: \u201cWe had a pretty smooth flight.\u201dMr. Ghani replied, \u201cWe arranged the weather for you.\u201dMr. Tillerson brought with him a six-person press contingent that was taken aside late the night before and sworn to secrecy about the trip until his plane returned to Doha, Qatar, where the trip had originated.Mr. Trump also promised to pressure Pakistan, which United States officials have long accused of playing a double game in Afghanistan \u2014 publicly supporting the United States mission here while secretly bankrolling and giving shelter to the Taliban and other insurgent groups.But the massive air base here demonstrates why the administration cannot get too tough with Pakistan, since nearly all of the supplies for this fortress city are transported by air or land through Pakistani territory. Soldiers can order supplies and gifts from Amazon, which delivers daily to the base.On Monday, Mr. Tillerson said that the United States was increasingly concerned about the stability of Pakistan, which has a large nuclear arsenal.\u201cPakistan needs to, I think, take a cleareyed view of the situation that they\u2019re confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan,\u201d he said.Mr. Tillerson said the United States would remain in Afghanistan until peace was restored. Or perhaps until things get much worse.\u201cThe president has made it clear that we\u2019re here to stay until we can secure a process of reconciliation and peace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an unlimited commitment.

{"Headline": "Nordstrom Suspends Effort to Go Private Until After the Holidays", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe family behind the 116-year-old Nordstrom retail chain is shelving its efforts to go private until after the holiday season, the company said Monday.The high-end Seattle-based brand, which has 360 stores across North America, is facing the same economic pressures and competition from e-commerce as other brick-and-mortar retailers. Although family members have been tight-lipped about their reasons for wanting to take the company private, such a move would allow Nordstrom more freedom to experiment with solutions while avoiding the scrutiny of public ownership and the pressure of quarterly earnings reports.Nordstrom\u2019s stock sank 5.3 percent Monday to $40.40, down $2.25 a share. The share price is down 22.2 percent from a year ago.The winter shopping season is always volatile \u2014 sales during the quarter can make or break a retailer \u2014 but this year\u2019s performance figures could be especially difficult to forecast given the effect of recent hurricanes, unseasonably warm weather and fast-paced online growth.And potential buyers are more skeptical given that mall-based retailers are in \u201ca space that right now is very broadly out of favor,\u201d said Dylan Carden, an analyst at William Blair.\u201cBanging up against the holiday period, lender appetite starts to wane and we\u2019re starting to see some pretty significant interest rates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get over the goal line.\u201dThe company\u2019s board formed a special committee of directors to review potential proposals from the family group, which includes Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom and Erik B. Nordstrom, who are co-presidents of the company. Other members are James F. Nordstrom, who is the company\u2019s president of stores; Bruce A. Nordstrom, chairman emeritus; and Anne E. Gittinger, a granddaughter of the company\u2019s co-founder.And several major mall-based brands including Gymboree, Rue 21 and Payless ShoeSource declared bankruptcy this year, while Wet Seal was sold.

{"Headline": "Where Internet Orders Mean Real Jobs, and New Life for Communities", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "Vast warehouses are being built, fueling a demand for lower-skilled workers and reviving areas that once relied on manufacturing.Supported byBETHLEHEM, Pa. \u2014 Ellen Gaugler remembers driving her father to the Bethlehem Steel mill, where he spent his working years hauling beams off the assembly line and onto rail cars.When the Pennsylvania plant shut down about two decades ago, Ms. Gaugler thought it was the last time she or anyone in Bethlehem would come to its gates to find a job that paid a decent wage for a physical day of work.But she saw an ad in the paper last year for a position at a local warehouse that changed her mind. She\u2019d never heard of Zulily, the online retailer doing the hiring, but she knew the address: It was on the old mill site, steps from where her father worked.\u201cWhen I came for the interviews I looked up and said, \u2018Oh, my God, I feel like I am at home,\u2019\u201d Ms. Gaugler said. She got the job.As shopping has shifted from conventional stores to online marketplaces, many retail workers have been left in the cold, but Ms. Gaugler is coming out ahead. Sellers like Zulily, Amazon and Walmart are competing to get goods to the buyer\u2019s doorstep as quickly as possible, giving rise to a constellation of vast warehouses that have fueled a boom for workers without college degrees and breathed new life into pockets of the country that had fallen economically behind.Warehouses have produced hundreds of thousands of jobs since the recovery began in 2010, adding workers at four times the rate of overall job growth. A significant chunk of that growth has occurred outside large metropolitan areas, in counties that had relatively little of the picking-and-packing work until recently.\u201cWe are at the very beginning of a rather large transformation, and the humble warehouse is the leading edge of this,\u201d said Michael Mandel, chief economic strategist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. \u201cThese fulfillment center jobs are not being created in the tech hubs that were growing before. We\u2019ve broadened the winner\u2019s circle.\u201dAmericans have grown more comfortable ordering everything on the internet, including bulky wares like canoes and refrigerators. Warehouses, as a result, have become gargantuan, doubling in size since 2010, according to CBRE, a real estate services firm.And while robots have started to intervene in the process, it still takes a lot of bodies to move hundreds of thousands of boxes in and out of these buildings every day. Warehouses serving the largest e-commerce sites typically employ upwards of 2,000 people.The hubs of this network are far-flung. In Bullitt County, Ky., south of Louisville, warehouse employment surged to 6,000 in 2017 from 1,200 in 2010, according to the Labor Department. In Kenosha, Wis., once a manufacturing hub whose auto plants turned out Nash Ramblers and Plymouth Horizons, warehouse jobs grew to 6,200 from 250 in the same period.Those places have the advantage of being surrounded by highways and rail lines that lead to some of the nation\u2019s largest cities. They also have an abundance of cheap land and labor, two assets that have become increasingly vital to companies selling online.The same calculus has made a warehouse mecca out of the land that houses the carcass of Bethlehem Steel, giving natives like Ms. Gaugler a sense that their hometown may be thriving.Ms. Gaugler, 54, earns $13.50 an hour putting together shipments at the Zulily warehouse, where employees tend to refer to their end customer as \u201cMom.\u201d She works 10-hour shifts from Wednesday through Saturday, and puts in for overtime whenever she can.\u201cI like to get those orders out to Mom,\u201d she said. The work is physically demanding, she said, but it\u2019s straightforward. She gets a list of items to pull from shelves every morning \u2014 toys, glassware, baby clothes \u2014 and works her way to the bottom as quickly as possible. She\u2019s gotten two raises, of 25 cents each, over the last year.There are people in town who are nostalgic for the time when the mill filled the sky with black smoke and the furnaces churned all day. Not Ms. Gaugler. \u201cThese are secure jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the steel, you didn\u2019t know if you would have a job the next day.\u201dHer father may have had a better deal at the mill \u2014 he got 13 weeks of vacation and \u201cdidn\u2019t have to worry about bills every so often,\u201d Ms. Gaugler said. But she only has an associate degree, and said this job pays better than most of her alternatives. It also comes with health insurance, paid time off and a 401(k) retirement plan.Before the warehouses came to the area, it had little to offer in the way of decent-paying, low-skilled work. But Amazon saw something promising in the city\u2019s bones.It is flanked by Interstate 78, providing a gateway to the nation\u2019s biggest metropolitan area \u2014 New York is 80 miles away \u2014 and putting seven other states within a day\u2019s drive.\u201cIt\u2019s location, being able to serve customers on the Eastern Seaboard and the Mid-Atlantic,\u201d said Ashley Robinson, an Amazon spokeswoman. \u201cIt\u2019s the infrastructure available to move those trucks out of the Lehigh Valley. It\u2019s the work force.\u201dThe company opened two modest facilities outside Allentown, Bethlehem\u2019s neighbor to the west, a place made famous by a Billy Joel song about the death of factory jobs. Other retailers rushed in, drawn partly by incentives, including abatements and credits, allowing companies that developed on the steel mill land to save hundreds of thousands on their tax bills over 10 years.\u201cI don\u2019t know of another place in the world that has gone from a submarket to a global hub in eight years,\u201d said David Egan, the global head of industrial and logistics research at CBRE. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that it is a key, crucial market for global trade.\u201dSome of the biggest players in the warehouse game have staked a claim to Lehigh Valley land. Walmart has two huge facilities in Bethlehem. FedEx is building one of its biggest ground locations in the nation in the area, and the United Parcel Service opened a new hub near the New Jersey border last year to handle the torrential volume of traffic coming through eastern Pennsylvania.The boom in warehouses has created a seemingly endless appetite for stockers, pickers and packers, turning the town into a magnet for people in need of a second chance. Omar Pellot is one of them.Mr. Pellot left the Bronx, where he was born, because it seemed as if the city had run out of jobs for people with his particular r\u00e9sum\u00e9.He says he started dealing drugs at the age of 8, on the guidance of his father, a \u201cdrug dealer turned drug addict.\u201d He was in and out of jail as a teenager and spent a year on Rikers Island as a 17-year-old, he said. After that stint, he had a hard time finding work in New York, so he relocated to Florida and eventually moved to the Lehigh Valley, where, he had heard, the job market was \u201cawesome.\u201dHe got a job at Amazon almost immediately. When the company asked about his background, he said, \u201cI explained it to them \u2014 you know, I was young and na\u00efve and stupid.\u201dIn a year as a picker \u2014 retrieving items from vast shelving units \u2014 Mr. Pellot said he walked about 10 miles on his night shift, and got two raises that pushed his hourly pay to $14.30. He passed a test to become a forklift driver and has his sights set on becoming a supervisor.Now 38, he spent his childhood \u201cthinking that street life would make me a man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is what makes me a man, working hard.\u201dThe shifts in warehouses may be long, and the work tedious and exhausting, but they are a better bet for people like Mr. Pellot than anything else in eastern Pennsylvania. The average warehouse worker in the area earns $14.46 an hour, compared with $12.67 for those in retail sales and $10.85 for waiters.\u201cThe conventional wisdom is that retail jobs are better and that losing them is bad for an economy,\u201d said Don Cunningham, president of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation. \u201cThe reality is that fulfillment jobs are paying a higher wage and offering more long-term opportunity.\u201dLingering over Bethlehem is the unnerving question of when, exactly, the robots will ruin the party. In a Walmart fulfillment center that takes up as much land as a big-league ballpark, machines have begun to take on some of the tasks involved in getting people their goods within a day of a click.As boxes careen down a conveyor belt on their way out of the building, tiny devices known as \u201cshoes\u201d follow alongside and jerk forward to push the packages into chutes that funnel them into the truck they are destined for.Box-shaped machines glide along shelves to snatch crates and deposit them onto a conveyor. There are no accidents on these routes \u2014 right before two boxes are about to crash into each other, a combination of sensors and software stops one and lets the other pass.But for now, humans are still needed, in ever-increasing numbers.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of stuff that gets done not necessarily by hand, but aided by the use of labor,\u201d said David Tarnosky, the general manager of the warehouse. Walmart started the year with around 1,100 full-time employees there, and doubled that number by October.\u201cWe won\u2019t stop hiring through peak of this year,\u201d Mr. Tarnosky said. By this time next year, he will have hired hundreds more.Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Key Is a Lot Less Scary Than My Post-1-Click Remorse", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFuture TenseOver the next week I was hounded by online ads for the same sneakers I\u2019d bought, along with others I\u2019d rejected and many more I hadn\u2019t even seen. (Amazon also showcased items \u201cinspired by\u201d my browsing history.) I tried to ignore them, but after seeing so many ghosts of sneakers past and passed up, I began second-guessing my purchase.The most obvious difference between brick-and-mortar and online shopping is physicality, both of the item itself and the consumer\u2019s presence in the store. Beyond the potential pitfall of not getting exactly what you thought you were buying online, a problem that is minimized when you can assess the product in person, the lack of tactile interaction may reduce our connection to the object.In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20 subjects, when the senses of smell and touch were paired with pictures of a product, the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in the perception of pleasantness, was activated more strongly than when those senses were independently engaged. (On its own, smell was the most important sense.)The tactile experience doesn\u2019t end in the checkout line. After purchasing an item, the consumer typically takes it home. This act of carrying it into one\u2019s domestic space can bolster one\u2019s proprietary pride: You are now responsible for its existence in your world. That act, plus roaming through aisles beforehand and going from shop to shop, can also be physically and mentally tiring.But ordering online for an anonymous deliveryman to leave the item at one\u2019s doorstep \u2014 or, with the help of Amazon Key, just inside \u2014 is impersonal and not enervating. It\u2019s the difference between the estrangement of ordering takeout and the intimacy of cooking for oneself. And a pavement-pounding, shop-till-you-drop marathon may recall an even more primal method for acquiring nutrients.\u201cYou\u2019re coming back to hunters and gatherers,\u201d Mr. Lindstrom said of in-store purchases. \u201cDopamine kicks in when we\u2019re buying stuff \u2014 there\u2019s a reptile brain that tells us we need to gather things before winter happens. The more we have to fight for things, the less likely we are to return it after. When it\u2019s delivered on Amazon Prime, you forget it was so hard to get this product.\u201dBut whereas cash-based transactions lead to more immediate remorse, 89 percent of shoppers said they feel guiltier when they receive their credit card statements after 1-Click orders than when they pay in cash. The remorse still exists with online shopping; it\u2019s just deferred, with extra pain later.Shopping on a website featuring attractive models or beautiful homes may engender the same sense of inadequacy that leafing through catalogs can, unlike picking them up in person, and that visual memory may linger when the object has been delivered, leading to remorse. Buying something online can also lead quickly to a social-media search after the fact for friends\u2019 and strangers\u2019 superior products (or \u201cbetter\u201d use of the same product).The sneakers I bought in this troublesomely bottomless marketplace were for casual wear, but I also needed a new pair of running shoes, a purchase that I undertook with more serious online research: reading reviews from specialized publications and individual users, comparing models from different years, taking quizzes to determine what was best for my particular stride.But even the highest-rated sneakers had their detractors, and those damning, all-caps review headlines (\u201cSHODDILY MADE,\u201d \u201cTHEY RUINED IT\u201d) made me hesitate whenever I was on the verge of adding them to my virtual shopping cart.A week after searching in vain and the ensuing deluge of targeted ads, I visited a nearby running store. I tried on a few pairs and solicited opinions from one employee, then picked the sneakers that felt best.Within 20 minutes I was walking out with them, glad to have given my money to a local business over a soulless national chain. There is undoubtedly a better running shoe out there for me, and I could probably find it if I spent enough time scouring the internet. But je ne regrette rien.Advertisement"}

What\u2019s in those empty spots? Why does no one know? Can I be the one to go find out?Katherine Rundell\u2019s latest middle-grade novel, \u201cThe Explorer,\u201d faces such enticing questions head on. After a plane crash, Fred is stranded in the Amazon jungle, where he will have to find shelter, food and \u2014 eventually \u2014 a way out. He\u2019s not alone: Stranded alongside the British schoolboy are Con (\u201cshort for Constantia, but if you call me that, I\u2019ll kill you\u201d), a strong-willed schoolgirl whose primness will be tested by the rain forest adventure to come; Lila, shy and even-keeled; and finally Max, Lila\u2019s little brother, a rascal prone to tantrums.\u201cThe Explorer\u201d moves at a good clip, its short scenes packed with crackling dialogue, and Rundell brings wonderful gusto to her descriptions of the many discomforts of junglelife. This is not the Amazon we think we know from films and cartoons. The piranhas and caimans the kids encounter aren\u2019t mindless killers but animals occupying important niches in the environment, and the true insect menace is not the spiders but the bullet ants. The kids come to realize the jungle is what European explorers called a \u201ccounterfeit paradise,\u201d seemingly abundant but lacking food outsiders can easily recognize.There\u2019s a classic feel to this story from its very start, with its crisply characterized quartet, the kids flawed but courageous, facing exciting dangers that the reader is certain they will overcome. Even though we\u2019re in the Brazilian Amazon, everyone speaks the King\u2019s English. It\u2019s rather like the way 19th-century Europeansviewed the Amazon itself, a playground in which to work out inner selves and bring home hard-won life lessons. Rundell seems to enjoy leaning right into the nostalgia factor of her setup, as when the kids begin to suspect that they\u2019re not alone in the jungle \u2014 and that the other person out there is one of those famous long-lost English explorers.After a heyday that includes classics like Gary Paulsen\u2019s \u201cHatchet\u201d and Jean Craighead George\u2019s \u201cJulie of the Wolves,\u201d survival stories for kids are having something of a waning moment. It\u2019s a shame, since they stoke the greatest dreams and anxieties of youth. What if there were no parents? What if I had to make my own dinner? Could I eat a grub if I had to? (Fred does, by the way, and finds it \u201clike eating porridge mixed with fingernail grime.\u201d)When calamity strikes, the kids must get back to civilization, and it\u2019s the mysterious adult they meet in the jungle \u2014 the lost \u201cexplorer\u201d of the book\u2019s title \u2014 who helps them do so. As they consider leaving, they face big questions: Do they keep the secret of this man who wants to be left alone in the deep forest, or do they tell his story? How does Fred hold on to the love he comes to feel for the jungle, \u201ca trumpet call to a part of him he had not known existed,\u201d once he returns to civilization?Rundell navigates these concerns with humor, as when Con notes that the Amazonian macaws \u201cmake the birds in England look like they\u2019re dressed for a job interview.\u201d The book\u2019s verve serves as a welcome counterpoint to the lyrical descriptions of the natural environment, like the \u201cwhite thundering smoke\u201d of the rain. At points, Rundell\u2019s poetic fervor gets the better of the narrative, and her flights of language can feel appropriate neither to Fred\u2019s point of view nor to the book\u2019s life-or-death stakes, as when young Fred finds the jungle \u201can infinite sweep of green: a Turkish carpet for a god\u201d or \u201cthe stars above them were clustered so thickly that the silver outnumbered the night.\u201d I\u2019d rather not be arrested by Rundell\u2019s language when I could have stayed immersed in our heroic kids\u2019 jungle journey instead.With its fine balance of menace and cheer, though, \u201cThe Explorer\u201d is perfectly suited to its middle-grade audience. It is a book to kindle imaginations. And though it emphasizes the fantastic otherness of the jungle in a way that feels almost antique, young readers will finish it with an impression of the grandeur of the natural world. It\u2019s a lesson we\u2019ll be learning and forgetting forever: \u201cWhen you get home, tell them how large the world is,\u201d the explorer says to the kids, \u201cand how green.\u201dEliot Schrefer is the author of \u201cThreatened\u201d and other books for young readers. \u201cMez\u2019s Magic,\u201d the first book in his new Lost Rainforest series, will be published in January.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Showdown Brews Between Amazon and Alibaba, Far From Home", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 From this concrete warehouse perched on the edge of a potentially vast new market for online shopping, the Alibaba Group of China hopes to beat Amazon one head of lettuce at a time.Under the glare of fluorescent lights, green-vested workers carefully wrap fruit, cheese and other perishables for delivery by vans to a growing group of Singaporeans who prefer to do their shopping online. On a nearby wall, printouts show the sorts of defects that customers have complained about in the past: overripe avocados, smelly spinach, rotten honeydews.\u201cIt\u2019s getting better and better,\u201d said Vikram Rupani, president of RedMart, an online grocery company based in Singapore that is part of Alibaba\u2019s push into the region, \u201cbut it\u2019s a continuous process that never ends.\u201dAlibaba and Amazon already dominate the business of selling stuff online in their home markets. Increasingly, they are competing against each other on neutral ground.Both are spending billions of dollars on Asia \u2014 particularly Southeast Asia and India \u2014 as they look for a place that could repeat China\u2019s explosive transformation into the world\u2019s biggest online shopping market.Amazon has committed $5 billion to India, where it lures customers to sign up for its Prime service, which includes Western movies and television shows, for a small fraction of the $99 annual membership price in the United States. Alibaba has invested roughly $500 million for stakes in both Paytm \u2014 India\u2019s largest mobile payments platform \u2014 and its e-commerce affiliate, Paytm Mall.Alibaba\u2019s bigger bet is in Southeast Asia. It has spent more than $2 billion to take control of Lazada, a five-year-old online shopping company based in Singapore and doing business in six countries. Last year, Lazada bought RedMart, the online retail grocery.Over about the same period, India\u2019s market could increase six times to a similar amount, Bain & Company, a consulting firm, projects.Alibaba and Amazon are seeking consumers like Janice Lee Fang, a Singaporean who decided she needed to buy a robot to amuse a 6-year-old daughter home sick from school. Through Amazon\u2019s Prime Now service, introduced in Singapore in July, she bought a Sphero SPRK Plus \u2014 a clear plastic ball that can skitter across the floor with a tap of a smartphone \u2014 that arrived in less than a day.\u201cI was thrilled,\u201d said Ms. Fang, who said she also uses Alibaba\u2019s services. \u201cI had time to unbox it and teach her how to use it. It\u2019s a last-minute shopping savior.\u201dBut Southeast Asia is no China. A diffuse area of 600 million people, the region is divided by politics, language and culture. Some places are modern, like Singapore. Other places lack the roads and other infrastructure to get people what they need.\u201cIt\u2019s a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural areas, separated by large distances and \u2014 in the Philippines and Indonesia \u2014 by water,\u201d said Mike Booker, a partner at the Southeast Asian arm of Bain. \u201cCash on delivery is still prevalent, and other local players are in the fray.\u201dThe challenges have forced Lazada, Alibaba\u2019s biggest Southeast Asian operation, to get creative.In Vietnam, local post offices take customer returns and give cash refunds. In Malaysia, customers can collect merchandise from lockers at 7-Eleven stores. And in the Philippines, Lazada uses gas stations as places where merchants can drop off their goods for delivery personnel to pick up.\u201cWe\u2019re in the super, super, super early days,\u201d said Inanc Balci, who oversees Lazada operations in the Philippines.Alibaba\u2019s international arm has seen its latest quarterly sales more than double in a year, in part from Lazada\u2019s contribution. Still, Lazada and its RedMart subsidiary remain a tiny, and unprofitable, part of Alibaba\u2019s empire. Max Bittner, Lazada\u2019s chief executive, said its Chinese parent has been willing to spend money to build its delivery capabilities and draw more customers.\u201cE-commerce is an economy of scale game,\u201d Mr. Bittner said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel constrained in any way. I can go after this opportunity with the amount of firepower I need.\u201dAmazon so far counts Singapore as its only Southeast Asian market, though industry experts widely expect it will expand into other countries. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.Southeast Asia could offer a test of their vastly different business models on neutral turf.Alibaba has a long lead over Amazon and is building up its infrastructure across Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, for example, it took a minority stake in August in another online marketplace, Tokopedia. Experts say Amazon could fight back by offering online Western movies and television programs as it does in the United States, which could increase its appeal with younger customers.Amazon stumbled in Singapore initially when the service proved too popular, forcing it to turn away customers. But since then the two companies have amped up their efforts to deliver more quickly to a growing group of customers.At the RedMart warehouse on a recent visit, workers packed cartons \u2014 sometimes nine at a time \u2014 from bins holding piles of cereal boxes and canned fruits and vegetables. For those who offer ways to improve the process, merit awards include movie tickets, vouchers and cash of up to $1,000.Competing in the market is likely to be expensive, thanks to customer price cuts and rebates in addition to expansion costs.\u201cIt\u2019s fabulous,\u201d said Uma Parameswar, a Singaporean who works in fine arts management. Over two and a half years of using RedMart, she said, only once did she receive fruit that was less than fresh.The enticements make her even more inclined to shop online. She says RedMart gives her a 5 percent discount on grocery bills plus discounts on using Uber\u2019s ride-hailing and other services.\u201cIt\u2019s saved me probably $200 in the last three or four months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The inside is very chewy, but not overly doughy. It\u2019s got a slight tang to the taste, and it\u2019s not too big,\u201d she said. \u201cBut some people might disagree.\u201dIndeed.The New York bagel \u2014 its texture, look and taste \u2014 has changed over time.We spoke to a few local bagel shops and asked them to weigh in on what makes a classic New York bagel.\u2022 It \u201cshould be crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside,\u201d said Melanie Frost, the chief operating officer at Ess-a-Bagel, in Midtown East. And they should be hand-rolled, she added.\u2022 \u201cThey should always be boiled, never steamed,\u201d said Philip Romanzi, owner of Bagel Hole in Park Slope, where they use malt syrup instead of sugar.\u2022 Niki Russ Federman, the co-owner of Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side, knows what a New York bagel is not. \u201cIt should not be sweet and you should never find blueberries, jalape\u00f1os, or rainbow colors in your bagel.\u201dHow would you describe a real New York bagel? And what bagel place in the city do you think gets it right?

{"Headline": "Will Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Fall Finally Reform Men?", "Date": "2017-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThis reckoning is all to the good, even if it is far too late. It feels as though a real and lasting transformation may be afoot \u2014 until you remember that this isn\u2019t the first time women have sounded the alarm.Remember former President Bill Clinton, whose popularity endures despite a long string of allegations of sexual misconduct and, in one case, rape \u2014 all of which he has denied. Mr. Clinton did eventually admit to the affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky, that nearly toppled his presidency, but he pointed out that it was not illegal.In other words, even the highest-profile opportunities to change America\u2019s endemic culture of sexual harassment, which is overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, committed by men against women, can somehow be lost or swept away. How do we keep that from happening again?And how do we ensure that progress filters down to average American workplaces, where sexual harassment occurs all the time but rarely gets media attention? The answer is part cultural, part economic and part legal.The reasons for this silence are obvious: Women fear retaliation, indifference or disbelief if they speak up. If it\u2019s hard for rich and famous people, so many of whom kept silent in the face of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s well-known depredations, imagine how much harder it is for someone with no political or economic power. But the Weinstein saga also illustrates what a difference it can make when women join together \u2014 and men join with them \u2014 to confront harassers openly.But speaking up only goes so far if employers don\u2019t make reporting harassment easy or the consequences for harassers swift and clear. Treating sexual harassment seriously is essential, not to protect against liability or to safeguard the bottom line, but because it\u2019s wrong for anyone to have to endure harassment at work. (Though it sure helps when liability and the bottom line are at stake, too.)One compromise could be to require businesses to report how many sexual-harassment claims they settle every year, or even how many complaints they receive. This would at least give prospective employees a chance to assess how bad the problem is at a given company, and could lead to greater public scrutiny in more extreme cases.This may turn out to be the year when the tide finally turned on sexual harassment. The elements for a permanent cultural shift are certainly in place. More women have entered the work force, and the pay gap with men is closing, though not fast enough. More women than men are graduating from college; more are earning advanced degrees; and increasing numbers are managers, though the proportions of women still become thinner and thinner the higher in management you look. And, crucially, the internet and social media have opened a door to instant communication and community support that didn\u2019t exist before, helping women feel less isolation and shame about their experiences, and more confident that speaking out will have a positive result.In the end, though, the most lasting change will have to come from men, who are doing virtually all the sexual harassing. Boys must be raised to understand why that behavior is wrong, teenagers need to be reminded of it and grown men need to pay for it until they get the message.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Newark Says, Hey Amazon, Look Over Here", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe city sits astride an extensive transportation network of trains, planes and automobiles. It has six colleges and universities with a total of 60,000 students. There is prime office space available, and new apartments downtown are far less expensive than housing in New York City or even Jersey City.The city is Newark.\u201cWe have exactly what Amazon is looking for, in terms of expanding their company in a city that will help them grow and where it would have real social impact,\u201d said Mayor Ras J. Baraka in an interview. \u201cNewark is an opportunity to make a real statement, about what they\u2019re trying to accomplish in the United States in the age of Trump.\u201dOn Monday afternoon, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Cory A. Booker, the former Newark mayor, joined Mr. Baraka at Rutgers Business School, which shares its building in the city with Audible Inc., whose 1,000 employees produce and sell audio entertainment and which is owned by Amazon, to announce that Newark is the state\u2019s official bid in the headquarters race.Governments have fallen over themselves offering Amazon billions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies and, in some cases, free land, prompting criticism from some economists and good government groups.In New Jersey, Mr. Christie and legislative leaders are offering up to $7 billion in state tax breaks for Amazon. The company already has a substantial footprint in the state, where it has several distribution centers that employ 5,500 workers, at substantially lower wages than are being promised for HQ2. Last year, Amazon announced it would open two more centers, adding another 2,000 full-time jobs.\u201cThey\u2019re talking about doubling already generous corporate tax breaks,\u201d said Jon Whiten, vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspective. \u201cThey\u2019re not saying, we\u2019ll invest billions in New Jersey Transit so workers can get to work on time, or in affordable housing so workers can have a decent place to live.\u201dHandicappers have put New York in the top 10 among the competitors for an HQ2 based on Amazon\u2019s own criteria, which include good public transportation, a skilled work force, the cost of doing business and a location within a metro area of more than one million residents.Moody\u2019s Analytics ranked New York sixth, behind Austin, Tex.; Atlanta; Philadelphia; Rochester; and Pittsburgh.But the Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm that represents companies seeking locations and cities trying to attract them, ranked the New York metropolitan area No. 1, ahead of Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston, out of 35 candidates.\u201cIt\u2019s at the absolute top in the sheer number of educated people and it\u2019s at the top with mass transit,\u201d said Patrick L. Anderson, the firm\u2019s founder. \u201cBut it\u2019s at the bottom in the cost of doing business.\u201d\u201cNew York can win,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it can\u2019t be in Manhattan, and I doubt it\u2019ll work in Brooklyn.\u201dThat could be the silver lining for Newark, where commercial rents are a third to half of those in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Newark may not have the glamour of New York City, but it\u2019s only an 18-minute train ride away. And market-rate apartment rents \u2014 which run about $30 a square foot \u2014 are the equivalent of subsidized housing in New York City.Newark also sits directly above the fiber optic cable spine running along the Eastern Seaboard, allowing companies to tap into some of the fastest internet services in the country and among the least expensive ultra-broadband network.And downtown, there is a Whole Foods \u2014 the upscale supermarket chain Amazon acquired earlier this year \u2014 as well as the fast-growing headquarters of Audible.The city, with its battle-scarred reputation, may seem like a long shot, but Mr. Baraka has pulled together a coalition convinced that Amazon would accelerate the city\u2019s comeback. There is a total of $2.6 billion worth of projects in the pipeline, according to acting Deputy Mayor Carmelo Garcia.\u201cI think the prospects are great,\u201d said Ben Feigenbaum, chief operating office of Edison Properties, a major landowner in Newark. \u201cAll the developers and political leaders know that Amazon would be good for everyone.\u201dHis company is in the midst of converting a 110-year-old warehouse at Edison Place and McCarter Highway into an office building, alongside a new park, Mulberry Commons, which the city is building after a decade of delays.Broadridge Financial Solutions, which provides technical services to financial institutions, recently announced it would move its headquarters and ultimately 1,000 employees to Newark from Jersey City. Several years ago, Panasonic moved its North American headquarters to a new glass tower downtown.There are also 7,000 apartments being developed downtown, once a mix of institutions, office buildings, courthouses and government offices.Many developers were wary when Mr. Baraka, son of the firebrand poet and activist Amiri Baraka, won the mayor\u2019s race in 2014. But he seems to have won their confidence with his focus on making the city better, not on higher office.And with a quarter of Newark\u2019s population living below the poverty line, he has pushed to extend the downtown development boom to the city\u2019s more impoverished areas in the south and west.As of this month, developers are required to set aside 20 percent of newly built or renovated apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants. In addition, the mayor has pushed developers to ensure that half the construction crews and half the permanent jobs for those projects are for Newark residents.\u201cThis administration has been an advocate for the progress we\u2019ve made,\u201d said Jonathan Cortell, vice president of L+M Development Partners, \u201cand very much intent on adding their own imprimatur on what we\u2019re doing next.\u201dThe project, which obtained tax credits and tax-exempt financing, includes 64 apartments for moderate-income households, such as a family of three making no more than $50,100.Audible subsidized the rents of 20 employees who moved into Hahne\u2019s as part of its Live Local program and helped create a pedestrian corridor between Audible\u2019s building and the rest of downtown.Two years ago, Audible established a technology venture fund in its building that has so far invested in 37 start-ups, with the hope that they will grow and rent space in Newark.For the last project, across the street from Audible, Ben Korman, a developer and the founder of Lotus Equity Group, is planning to demolish Riverside Stadium, a minor-league baseball park that was part of an earlier, ill-advised attempt to accelerate Newark\u2019s comeback. The city and the county invested as much as $34 million, but it never drew the hoped-for crowds.Even before the Amazon sweepstakes started, Mr. Korman\u2019s company planned to demolish the brick stadium to make way for a 2.3 million-square-foot mix of residential and commercial buildings, retail and green space. Amazon could speed up the construction schedule.An earlier version of a picture caption that accompanied this article misspelled the first name of the former mayor of Newark. He is Senator Cory A. Booker, not Corey.Advertisement"}

For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year.The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming. Amazon, Google, DJI, Intel and Hollywood lobbied the Obama administration to ease rules on commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. Amazon even proposed a future highway system in the sky, in which lower altitudes would be reserved for lighter weight drones that could deliver packages.But the Transportation Department has proceeded cautiously around allowing the machines to integrate into airspace shared by planes. Lawmakers and public interest groups have also raised concerns about privacy.The White House said the approach taken by the United States until now has put the country behind other nations on technology innovation.Wing is testing in Australia, Amazon in Britain and Zipline in Rwanda, said Michael Kratsios, the deputy assistant to the president at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\u201cTo maintain U.S. leadership, our country needs a regulatory framework,\u201d Mr. Kratsios said.Advertisement"}

Membership, granted for life, quickly turned into the ultimate indicator of status \u2014 moviedom\u2019s equivalent of the mob\u2019s \u201cmade man.\u201dBut the academy stands at a precipice. Harvey Weinstein could change everything.Late Friday, Amazon decided not to move forward with a Weinstein-produced mafia series from David O. Russell that had previously received a two-season commitment and was estimated to cost $160 million.\u201cWe support Amazon\u2019s decision as in light of recent news and out of respect for all those affected we have decided together that it is best to not move forward with this show,\u201d Mr. Russell said in a statement with two stars of the series, Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore.Even so, many people in Hollywood think the academy only has one option when it comes to Mr. Weinstein: Kick him out.Censuring Mr. Weinstein, a fixture on the Oscar circuit for two decades who lived for the validation the awards gave him, would also be a chance for Hollywood to reckon with a past that includes rampant mistreatment of women \u2014 all the way back to the days of Mayer and his fellow good-old-boy studio chiefs.\u201cThe idea that anyone would give him a second chance or entertain that notion that he can change is beyond absurd,\u201d Terry Press, the president of CBS Films, wrote on Facebook of Mr. Weinstein. \u201cIf the academy does not kick him out, I am resigning my academy membership.\u201dThe academy declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein beyond a statement it released midweek.\u201cThe academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent and antithetical to the high standards of the academy and the creative community it represents,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in a diminished state more recently, he remained a player, prodding the tiny art film \u201cLion\u201d to six nominations this year.In total, Mr. Weinstein has overseen campaigns that have resulted in more than 300 Academy Award nominations and best-picture Oscars for \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d \u201cChicago,\u201d \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Artist.\u201d In addition to his one Oscar win, Mr. Weinstein also holds one nomination, for producing \u201cGangs of New York.\u201dSeven months ago, Mr. Weinstein was in his element when he hosted the Weinstein Company\u2019s annual pre-Oscars party at the Montage Beverly Hills hotel.

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I. Talent", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "Nearly all big tech companies have an artificial intelligence project, and they are willing to pay experts millions of dollars to help get it done.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s start-ups have always had a recruiting advantage over the industry\u2019s giants: Take a chance on us and we\u2019ll give you an ownership stake that could make you rich if the company is successful.Now the tech industry\u2019s race to embrace artificial intelligence may render that advantage moot \u2014 at least for the few prospective employees who know a lot about A.I.Typical A.I. specialists, including both Ph.D.s fresh out of school and people with less education and just a few years of experience, can be paid from $300,000 to $500,000 a year or more in salary and company stock, according to nine people who work for major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them. All of them requested anonymity because they did not want to damage their professional prospects.Well-known names in the A.I. field have received compensation in salary and shares in a company\u2019s stock that total single- or double-digit millions over a four- or five-year period. And at some point they renew or negotiate a new contract, much like a professional athlete.At the top end are executives with experience managing A.I. projects. In a court filing this year, Google revealed that one of the leaders of its self-driving-car division, Anthony Levandowski, a longtime employee who started with Google in 2007, took home over $120 million in incentives before joining Uber last year through the acquisition of a start-up he had co-founded that drew the two companies into a court fight over intellectual property.Salaries are spiraling so fast that some joke the tech industry needs a National Football League-style salary cap on A.I. specialists. \u201cThat would make things easier,\u201d said Christopher Fernandez, one of Microsoft\u2019s hiring managers. \u201cA lot easier.\u201dThere are a few catalysts for the huge salaries. The auto industry is competing with Silicon Valley for the same experts who can help build self-driving cars. Giant tech companies like Facebook and Google also have plenty of money to throw around and problems that they think A.I. can help solve, like building digital assistants for smartphones and home gadgets and spotting offensive content.Most of all, there is a shortage of talent, and the big companies are trying to land as much of it as they can. Solving tough A.I. problems is not like building the flavor-of-the-month smartphone app. In the entire world, fewer than 10,000 people have the skills necessary to tackle serious artificial intelligence research, according to Element AI, an independent lab in Montreal.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d said Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, who previously worked at Google. \u201cThey are anxious to ensure that they\u2019ve got this small cohort of people\u201d who can work on this technology.\u201cIt is hard to compete with that, especially if you are one of the smaller companies,\u201d said Jessica Cataneo, an executive recruiter at the tech recruiting firm CyberCoders.By 2013, Google, Facebook and a few other companies started to recruit the relatively few researchers who specialized in these techniques. Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft\u2019s Skype phone service.With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.\u201cThere is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.\u201cThere are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,\u201d Mr. Zettlemoyer said. \u201cThe salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.\u201dThe basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call \u201ca dark art.\u201d Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with Google, and I don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. \u201cSo I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.\u201dBut the industry\u2019s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won\u2019t be alleviated for years.\u201cOf course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,\u201d Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. \u201cIt takes many years to train a Ph.D.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

And despite recent problems, it has one of the best and most extensive public transportation systems in the world, as well as train stations and international airports.The city\u2019s proposal cites four neighborhoods \u2014 the West Side of Manhattan; Lower Manhattan; Long Island City in Queens, and what is referred to as the Brooklyn Tech Triangle \u2014 the Downtown, Dumbo and Brooklyn Navy Yard areas \u2014 that could accommodate Amazon\u2019s requirements: 500,000 square foot modern of office space available in 2018 and another 7.5 million square feet over time as Amazon builds the kind of urban campus it has in Seattle.New York City is not offering special subsidies or tax breaks for Amazon beyond the incentives available to any company.\u201cWe see this as a competition for 50,000 new job openings \u2014 jobs we want New Yorkers to land,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday. \u201cWe win it based on the talent of our workers and the incredible diversity of industries in this town. Those are the strengths you can\u2019t buy with tax breaks.\u201dChicago tried to get a jump on the competition by submitting its proposal on Monday, three days early. The same day, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey dangled $7 billion in subsidies and incentives behind its bid to put Amazon HQ2, as the project has become known, in Newark.Handicappers place New York high on their lists of possible winners. Moody\u2019s Analytics, an economics research firm, ranked New York sixth, behind Austin, Tex.; Atlanta; Philadelphia; Rochester; and Pittsburgh based on six criteria, including human capital, cost of doing business and transportation.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics said, it is very likely that Amazon will put HQ2 on the East Coast, \u201cpreferably the Northeast Corridor.\u201d In that case, New York rises to No. 3 behind Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\u201cNew York gets dinged by its cost structure,\u201d he said.Amazon is expected to winnow its list of candidates by Dec. 25, but the review process will extend well into 2018.In addition to New York City\u2019s proposal, the state is putting up its own candidates. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is backing proposals from Western New York and the Finger Lakes; the Syracuse area; the region near Albany; and a metro New York City bid that includes Long Island and parts of the Hudson Valley.The state\u2019s top economic development official, Howard Zemsky, has crafted an incentive or subsidy package for Amazon, although state officials declined to release details because of the competitive nature of the contest.In drafting its proposal, the state has had to navigate the upstate-downstate divide, not wanting to be accused of favoring New York City.\u201cThis project is a major opportunity and New Yorkers should know that we are doing everything we can to attract Amazon HQ2 \u2014 and 50,000 jobs \u2014 to the Empire State,\u201d Mr. Zemsky said in a statement Wednesday.City officials have also had to step lightly, not wanting to set off interborough rivalries. After Amazon announced the contest in September, officials from nearly every corner of the city wrote directly to Amazon explaining why it should come to their respective areas. The city itself received applications from 27 neighborhoods.Ultimately, officials said that neither the Bronx nor Staten Island could meet Amazon\u2019s criteria for an urban campus. Staten Island, however, may have won a consolation prize.Amazon is building a distribution center there that is expected to eventually employ 2,250 workers, albeit at lower wages than at the new headquarters. For that, the state is giving Amazon up to $18 million in tax credits, based on its payroll numbers.Last month, Amazon signed a lease for a large block of space on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, where it expects to have 2,000 jobs in finance, sales and marketing. The company also has administrative offices on 34th Street and a photography and videography studio in Brooklyn with about 50 employees.Some developers, like Stephen M. Ross, chairman of Related Companies, are skeptical that a company so sensitive to cost would consider New York City.Mr. Ross\u2019s company submitted bids in New York, Chicago, where it has a vacant 62-acre parcel, and Boston.City officials asked landlords in each of the four New York City areas to lock up 500,000 square feet of vacant space for Amazon until the end of the year.The West Side of Manhattan features the Hudson Yards development, a transit hub at Penn Station and as much as 26 million square feet of available office space, as well as housing, culture and parks.But is also the most expensive option in a city where housing and office costs are already higher than elsewhere.Lower Manhattan, has evolved into a residential and commercial district since the Sept. 11 attacks, with a large development site available at the World Trade Center.Amazon, according to the city\u2019s proposal, could also make use of Governors Island, for an innovation center that could attract visitors and tourists.The so-called Brooklyn Tech Triangle, may be more likely. There are already 17,000 jobs at 1,400 tech-related or innovative companies and an array of arts and cultural organizations in the area.Next to Barclays Center, there is a site for a 1 million-square-foot tower.The other option is Long Island City, Queens, a former industrial area that is similar to where Amazon built its campus in Seattle. The neighborhood has new housing, restaurants, bars, art galleries museums and locations for up to 13 million square feet of new office space.Boosters for each neighborhood have been eager to make their cases.\u201cBrooklyn stacks up well not just in the city but from a nationwide perspective,\u201d said Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership.\u201cLong Island City checks every box Amazon has on its list,\u201d countered Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership. She is Regina Myer, not Meyer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While Tax Cuts Remain Theoretical, the Economy Blooms", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThird-quarter growth was a pleasant surprise after economists projected expansion of 2.5 percent. Growth in consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic output, slowed to 2.4 percent but is expected to rebound as the effects of the hurricanes fade. And rising inventories contributed just over 0.7 percentage point to growth, in what could be a sign that companies think consumer demand will warm up.There are other positive signs. Business investment, which had been lagging but improved in recent months, came in at a healthy 3.9 percent. Exports increased 2.3 percent in the third quarter, which added more than 0.4 percentage point to economic growth. It was aided by global expansion, with world economic growth in sync for the first time in years and Europe catching up with the United States. The International Monetary Fund projected that the global economy would increase 3.6 percent in 2017 and grow 3.7 percent the next year.President Trump has promised to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent \u2013 but whether or not he succeeds, companies are performing well. The Nasdaq reached a record high (not adjusted for inflation) on Friday morning after tech groups like Amazon and Microsoft reported robust third-quarter earnings. On top of that, the United States is nearly at full employment with a jobless rate of 4.2 percent.Past form suggests Mr. Trump will take credit. True, the nearly 20 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-share index since his election happened partly because of the hope of tax cuts. But most of the positive economic trends are occurring without major legislative accomplishments. The biggest risk to this outlook is harmful trade policies, including a disintegration of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for which negotiations aren\u2019t going well. The best that can be said is that Mr. Trump has not yet done the economy harm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Lost 33,000 Jobs in September; Unemployment Rate Dips to 4.2%", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut economists discounted the discouraging report, describing it as a blip in a job market that was fundamentally strong.That pattern held true for Bruce Gropper, who runs Right at Home, a home-care franchise in Palm Beach, Fla.\u201cWe put our hiring on hold\u201d because of the weather, Mr. Gropper said, adding that many of the 50 to 75 caregivers who work for him and would typically have been in the field were unable or unavailable to work during a two-week period. \u201cNow, things are back to normal.\u201dIt was the same in Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of manufacturing jobs in Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Houston, all of which suffered damage,\u201d noted Ray Perryman, president of the Perryman Group, an economic research and analysis firm based in Waco, Tex. \u201cSome of these plants were shut down for an extended period of time, and that would have gotten into the September survey.\u201dMr. O\u2019Sullivan and several economists agreed that the labor market was still pushing ahead \u2014 no matter how unevenly \u2014 in what is now the ninth year of an economic expansion. \u201cThe other data we\u2019ve been seeing this week don\u2019t show any signs of a weaker trend,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cIf you take out Texas and Florida, there\u2019s been no increase in jobless claims over the past five weeks.\u201dThe stock market\u2019s reaction to the news was mildly negative. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index declined slightly from record levels after eight straight days of gains.The hefty growth in average wages reported on Friday was probably exaggerated, because many low-wage workers were temporarily displaced by the storms, bumping up the overall average.Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing, said that employers she worked with were raising wages and reaching into less-common pools of potential employees like retirees, stay-at-home moms and people with disabilities.Ms. Glaser said she expected wages to rise further, saying some of her clients were thinking about increasing hourly wages as much as 20 to 40 percent during the peak holiday season and early next year. Employers are also pushing to retain the workers they have \u2014 for example, by offering more bonuses for e-commerce and other seasonal workers who stay through the holidays.Some businesses are trying to generate and educate their work forces by offering more paid internships and apprenticeships. Others are shortening the interview cycle to improve their chances. \u201cThere is a need for speed,\u201d Ms. Glaser said. \u201cWhoever gets to a candidate first is well positioned.\u201dRadial, the second-largest direct-to-consumer e-commerce company behind Amazon, is hiring 27,000 people to work in its 25 warehouses around the country through mid-January. Even as brick-and-mortar retail is suffering significant losses, e-commerce continues to thrive.\u201cWe\u2019re hiring 35 percent, or 7,000, more people than we did last year,\u201d said Stefan Weitz, Radial\u2019s executive vice president for technology services. \u201cIt\u2019s very competitive. A lot of logistics companies have operations in similar areas because of the proximity to air and ground transport.\u201dAt the upper end of the labor market, the competition for highly skilled workers is intense. Bryan Leach, founder of Ibotta, a Denver company offering a mobile shopping app, said he had hired more than 100 people this year, including engineers, product managers and data scientists, mostly at six-figure salaries.\u201cWe are hiring national search firms to shop for talent in the coasts,\u201d in addition to seven in-house recruiters, Mr. Leach said. The company has also helped sponsor billboards in San Francisco promoting the benefits of living in Denver and is offering $1,000 apiece to employees who refer friends who are hired.For some workers, such jobs have limited appeal. The labor force participation rate peaked its head above 63 percent in September, but many workers remain on the sidelines.Revised hiring figures for July and August showed that a total of 38,000 fewer jobs were created in those two months than previously reported, bringing the monthly average gain in 2017 \u2014 excluding September \u2014 to 170,000. August\u2019s figures will be revised one more time, while September\u2019s will be revised twice over the next two months. State-by-state tallies for September are not yet available.The Katrina experience showed that hiring can rebound quickly after a disaster, as damaged communities clean up and rebuild. Employment gains averaged 249,000 in the six months before the storm. After New Orleans found itself underwater, gains averaged 76,000 over the next couple of months before soaring to 341,000 in November 2005.While the recovery from the latest storms takes shape, businesses and workers are still counting their losses. Brian Petranick, Right at Home\u2019s president and chief executive, said Palm Beach was not the only community where franchises were unable to connect workers and clients. He estimated hurricane-related losses to the company would end up at $13 million to $15 million. \u201cDuring big storms, we see a loss of hours and services,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means caregivers are losing the opportunity to work and make money.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTClifford Krauss and Ben Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Following the (Bike) Trail to Amazon\u2019s Second Headquarters", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAmazon will probably narrow the list to a group of finalists before conducting site visits and meeting with elected officials and community leaders. It has said it expects to reach a decision next year.Still, Amazon\u2019s stated objectives and past behavior \u2014 along with interviews with people working with the company on the selection process (none of whom were willing to be named because of their Amazon ties) and corporate governance and location experts \u2014 yield some insights into what factors the retailer values most highly and where the new headquarters may end up. (An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.)This means far more than an attractive building or campus. Amazon prides itself on having its existing headquarters embedded in the urban fabric of Seattle. Just this month, the company said it would take over the top six floors of the Macy\u2019s department store downtown \u2014 a move rich in irony, given how Macy\u2019s has struggled in competing with online retailers \u2014 and it will occupy all of the office space at the Rainier Square development that is planned for the city\u2019s downtown area.The idea of inhabiting the sort of self-contained suburban corporate parks so common in Silicon Valley seems anathema to Amazon. The company has said that 20 percent of its employees in Seattle don\u2019t use motorized transport to get to work. Fifty-five percent walk, ride bikes or use public transportation. Fifteen percent live in the ZIP code where they work.Amazon deliberately provides cafeteria space for only a third of its employees, which encourages people to venture out of the office. The company provides retail space on the ground floor of its Seattle buildings and tries not to rent to generic national chains (its headquarters has a dozen local coffee roasters.) It has developed a sense of the kind of urban community that attracts and retains highly educated, talented and creative workers.In practical terms, this kind of dense, vibrant and architecturally distinctive urban environment exists mostly in cities that developed before the advent of the automobile, industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast and older cities in Canada.Cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit and Baltimore are rich in underutilized historic buildings and neighborhoods that could be imaginatively repurposed, offering Amazon the opportunity to be a transformative force, something that seems to be part of the company\u2019s DNA.Cyril Bouquet, a professor at IMD, an international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and an expert in companies with dual headquarters, said the choice of a second headquarters sends an important symbolic message.\u201cAmazon has the opportunity to help build and shape a city and region,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s easier in a Detroit than a San Francisco. It\u2019s much different than just tapping the talent that\u2019s already there. Amazon will attract people and other companies that are inspired by that.\u201dNext on Amazon\u2019s wish list are capital and operating costs\u201d and \u201cincentives,\u201d which Amazon identifies as \u201chigh priority\u201d considerations. That is as it should be, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cAmazon\u2019s first obligation is to its investors,\u201d Professor Elson said, which means finding \u201cthe most cost-effective city in which to locate a second headquarters,\u201d one that \u201cwill produce the most value for the company.\u201dMost contenders have been secretive about their bids, but the incentives will probably be substantial. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and state lawmakers, for instance, have offered a $7 billion package of tax breaks on behalf of Newark. Any city that really wants Amazon will have to ante up, and most will find the wherewithal to do so.New York City, with a score of 104.7, and San Francisco (104.5) are two of the most expensive cities in the country, making them long shots. (Seattle, at 100.8, is just above the baseline.) Boston, at 101.2, would probably barely make the cut. Washington\u2019s score is 99.4.The lowest-cost American cities are mostly in the Sunbelt; Austin\u2019s score is 96.2. But many older industrial cities also offer cost advantages: Cincinnati (94), Baltimore (96.5), Pittsburgh (97), Chicago (98.3) and Philadelphia (99.8) are all below the baseline. Thanks to the strong dollar (which could change over time), Canadian cities fare especially well: Montreal\u2019s score is 85.2; Toronto\u2019s is 85.6. Both cities also have vibrant urban cores and have emphasized Canada\u2019s talent-friendly immigration policies.\u201cLabor Force\u201d is third on Amazon\u2019s list. The company appears to be bumping up against the limits of Seattle\u2019s talent pool.The top cities on that list are San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and New York \u2014 no surprises there. But other cities also fare well: Washington is No. 4, Toronto is No. 6, Boston is No. 9 and Baltimore is No. 11.Conversely, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis all rank so low it is hard to see them as viable contenders.Detroit, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh fall somewhere in the middle, but could still be competitive. Amazon appears less concerned with how many tech workers already live and work in an area than with its ability to attract the talent it wants. Seattle was hardly a tech magnet before Amazon, Microsoft and then a host of once-fledgling technology firms set up operations there. Amazon expects its arrival in a new city to have a similar impact.Amazon adds that \u201ca strong university system is required.\u201dMany contending cities offer first-rate universities, including highly ranked programs in technology. Boston is a standout, with Harvard, M.I.T., Boston College, Boston University, but Baltimore offers Johns Hopkins University and Toronto has the University of Toronto and York University.Amazon cites logistics as \u201ccritically important,\u201d specifically the presence of an international airport that offers direct flights to Seattle, Washington, New York and San Francisco. (These cities are likely to have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquarters.)In addition to major airports, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtrak\u2019s northeast rail corridor, with easy rail access to New York and Washington.\u201cCommunity cultural fit\u201d and \u201ccommunity quality of life\u201d are last on Amazon\u2019s list of preferences. Along with the usual amenities, Amazon specifically mentions \u201ca diverse population\u201d and, again, \u201cexcellent institutions of higher education.\u201d If weather and independent coffee roasters are important, Austin would be a good fit.Most major cities offer an array of cultural, culinary, recreational and sports attractions, and any that they lack will most likely spring up if Amazon arrives.That puts a premium on diversity and education, factors important in attracting a talented work force. Given Amazon\u2019s vocal support for diversity and inclusion, it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as intolerant or that has moved to curb civil rights, like North Carolina\u2019s widely publicized effort to curb gay and transgender rights.There are obviously many variables still to be assessed, but based on these criteria and the weight I expect Amazon to place on them, here are my finalists, in descending order: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago and Boston.The \u201cCommon Sense\u201d column on Friday, about Amazon\u2019s search for a city to locate a second headquarters, rendered incorrectly the name of a commercial real estate firm that produces an annual ranking of cities based on what it calls \u201ctech talent.\u201d It is CBRE, not CRBE.Advertisement"}

Obsessively detailed composites of actual crime scenes, some of which cost nearly as much to build as full-size houses did when she was constructing the re-creations in the 1940s and \u201950s, they were an innovative tool the Chicago heiress invented to teach homicide detectives how to notice clues.In \u201cDark Bathroom,\u201d a doll-size corpse sprawls in a bathtub, and an empty bottle lies open on the carpet; in \u201cAttic,\u201d a gray-haired woman, in stockings Lee knitted with pins, hangs from the rafters beside an overturned chair.Opens Oct. 27.His target this time is Christian, the curator of a modern-art museum in Stockholm whose finely crafted life is undone when an ill-conceived plan to get back his stolen wallet and iPhone unwittingly results in a public relations scandal.When the actor Eric Berryman saw that production two years ago, he was inspired to create something similar. He brought the idea to the Wooster Group, along with an album made in 1964 by the folklorist Bruce Jackson, containing the singing and spoken words of black men locked up on segregated prison farms. They were the voices Mr. Berryman wanted to pay homage to.\u201cI was in East Anglia today, and I went past the place where \u2014 where my unraveling started,\u201d Emma Banville, a human rights lawyer, played by Helen McCrory, tells her hospitalized father in \u201cFearless,\u201d a British thriller debuting Friday, Oct. 27, on Amazon Prime.

But when a questionable confession at the hands of Detective Inspector Olivia Greenwood (Wunmi Mosaku) \u2014 now assigned to counterterrorism command \u2014 results in Russell\u2019s freedom, pending a retrial, Banville is snared in a Pandora\u2019s box involving Sir Alastair McKinnon (Michael Gambon), a disquieted politician turned Cambridge master who has summoned sinister American operatives to the scene.Advertisement"}

House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending \u2014 a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier. Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers. They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.\u201cIt is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill.

But for Mark Yong, the 36-year-old founder and CEO of Garuda Robotics, their applications extend far beyond security. From employing UAVs to optimize farming processes to inventing a comprehensive drone-based system for safe and accurate tower inspections, Garuda Robotics is heralding a new age in which drones will play an indispensable role in our lives.\u201cI\u2019ve always been tinkering with things,\u201d says Yong, whose work with drones is a natural culmination of his life experience. Born into a family of physics and math teachers, Yong conceived and built his first robot when he was 10 for an elementary school class project \u2013 a remote-controlled roaming device with a rolling brush that swept up dirt into an attached dustpan. It was a Roomba of sorts, before the automated disc-shaped vacuum machines became the gateway robot for households across the world.The project triggered a lifelong interest in robotics. So off he went to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh to study engineering. This was in the wake of the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, when the lifesaving potential of robotics was impressed upon him. He joined a team under the robotics professor Illah Nourbakhsh to build search-and-rescue robots. Nourbakhsh remembers Yong as an \u201cabsolutely outstanding\u201d member of the team, with the social skills to match his technical aptitude \u2013 traits that would serve him well as an entrepreneur later on.DragGaruda\u2019s flagship drone is outfitted with sensors and a thermal camera.\nYong started Garuda in 2014, joining forces with his former Pittsburgh housemate Ong Jiin Joo and Pulkit Jaiswal, a former student at the Nanyang Technological University (who would later found another drone company called SwarmX).From day one, he was adamant that his fledgling company address real problems. He homed in on the agriculture sector because of its scalability: there are around 16 million hectares of palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia. \u201cBecause of the size and importance of the industry to the region,\u201d Yong says, \u201ceven making 25 percent of crops healthier will have an immediate and significant impact.\u201dOne weekThe amount of time Garuda takes to assemble, calibrate and test-drive a new droneEven making 25 percent of crops healthier will have an immediate and significant impact.\nToday, Garuda\u2019s team of 12 caters to a handful of international clients in Southeast Asia, including in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.Blurring the lines between investor and customer provided useful clarity in the design process for Yong and his team. They weren\u2019t designing drone systems for hypothetical problems; his operations team makes frequent trips to plantations to fine-tune their products in a real-world context. \u201cAs builders, you want to sell what you build,\u201d he says, \u201cbut in business you need to sell what other people want to buy.\u201dGaruda Robotics\u2019 product offerings are equal parts hardware, software and data analytics. And the number of useful applications they offer is growing.The bulk of the company\u2019s work lies in the agriculture sector in Southeast Asia. In the face of surging populations as the region continues its march toward industrialization, the need to find viable ways to increase yields with a shrinking amount of arable land is becoming more urgent.To Yong, drones could help maximize output in a sustainable way. Besides the obvious benefits of speed, precision and improved yields, Garuda\u2019s solutions in the agriculture sector could also reduce the region\u2019s reliance on slash-and-burn farming, which damages the environment and is a major contributor to Southeast Asia\u2019s perennial haze problems.The drone flies with an attached infrared camera to take images that will help analyze the health of the crops.Another key area of Garuda\u2019s focus is infrastructure. Its TowerSight system is a comprehensive and automated way of inspecting telecommunications towers and other, similar structures. The M06A drone follows a precharted inspection route according to each tower\u2019s specifications. Precision sensors installed on the drone ensure greater accuracy and minimize human error. The entire process takes around a third of the time the inspection traditionally requires and eliminates safety hazards such as working from dangerous heights.The M06A drone follows a precharted inspection route to gather visual data from telecom towers.Yong\u2019s problem-solving approach to entrepreneurship also translates into a sensitivity to what\u2019s happening in the region. Singapore\u2019s tropical climate makes it a fertile breeding ground for mosquitos, and the island frequently struggles with outbreaks of dengue fever. In 2016, there was the looming threat of Zika. Garuda was commissioned by the government to create the Garuda Dragonfly, a UAV system in which drones inspect hard-to-reach nooks and crannies to scan for stagnant pools of water and spray larvicide to neutralize carriers of disease.The UVA carries a camera and an onboard delivery mechanism, which allows inspectors to locate stagnant pools of water in real time.Many believe that the drone age is only dawning as UAVs inevitably become a core part of even the most traditional industries.\u201cNew cities are being created in Southeast Asia as the region urbanizes,\u201d says Yong, \u201cand we need technology like drones and their data-capture capabilities to understand what\u2019s wrong with buildings, bridges, telecom towers and so on.\u201dGlobally, beyond agriculture and infrastructure inspection, drones are being designed to provide a wide range of services. Amazon, for instance, is test-driving drones to deliver books and other products. Meanwhile, researchers are exploring ways in which drones can be used for humanitarian purposes \u2013 for instance, dropping medical supplies and relief packages to far-flung, cut-off communities hit by natural disasters. In other words, UAVs are much more than mere playthings that take pictures.$127.3 billionThe expected value of the global drone market by 2020Change happens slowly, until people\u2019s mind-sets change. Then it happens all at once.\nThe main challenge on the business side, according to Yong, is convincing potential customers to change the way things have been done for decades and take a chance on the future. \u201cOnce the novelty wears off, more will realize that drones are a platform for more important technologies that have industrial capabilities,\u201d he says of the disruptive potential of drones. \u201cChange happens slowly, until people\u2019s mind-sets change. Then it happens all at once.\u201dEntrepreneurial drive is deeply rooted in Credit Suisse\u2019s long history and it\u2019s needed now, more than ever, to master the challenges ahead.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "U.S. Investor Tries to Shake Up Sina, a Pillar of China\u2019s Internet", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese internet boom has been good to Sina. Maybe, protests one of its American investors, it could have been better.Still, Sina finds itself embroiled in an unusual situation for a company with a surging stock price: a proxy fight. Aristeia Capital, a hedge fund based in Connecticut, is lobbying Sina shareholders to back its two candidates for the company\u2019s board in a bid to shake up Sina\u2019s business and give shareholders fatter returns. This week, the other shareholders will weigh in, casting their votes before a shareholder meeting set for Friday.Proxy fights in general are not uncommon, but one between a Chinese company and an American investor is the first of its kind, according to disclosures tracked by the data provider FactSet. And the campaign has helped to underscore the limits of foreign ownership of Chinese internet companies.Sina, one of the first Chinese tech companies to list its shares in New York, has called Aristeia \u201cself-serving\u201d and na\u00efve about how China\u2019s internet sector works.In turn, Aristeia, which manages $3 billion in investor money, has accused Sina of \u201cfailing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.\u201dForeign investors seem less than worried about any lack of control or lapses in corporate governance if the market is any indication. Shares in those companies have been on a tear in markets around the world as Chinese consumers reliably use their smartphones to buy electronics, shop for groceries, make investments, play games and look for dates.With more than 700 million users, China is the world\u2019s largest single internet market. Weibo has 313 million monthly average users.Still, some investors are quietly complaining about corporate governance practices.Chinese companies that list shares in the United States are not necessarily subject to American rules. Most are incorporated in light regulatory jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands.As a result, Chinese companies often behave differently. While Sina holds a regular annual meeting, some of its peers do not, a standard for the United States. Baidu, the search engine giant, has not held an annual shareholder meeting since 2008. JD.com, the online retailer, has never held one.\u201cInvestors have been getting a bit fed up with companies like Baidu and JD.com not having general meetings,\u201d said Jamie Allen, the secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association.A spokesman for JD.com said: \u201cInvestors appreciate our candor both on earnings calls and in engagement throughout the year. This issue has rarely, if ever, been raised to us.\u201d Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.Foreign investors also typically have fewer shareholder protections. To get around Chinese restrictions on outside investments in sensitive industries, many companies use a complicated legal structure, called a variable interest entity, or V.I.E. Under those arrangements, shareholders have rights to the profits of a company, but they do not control key assets \u2014 potentially leaving them exposed if the company runs into trouble or the Chinese government declares the structure illegal.Sina was a key player in the Chinese internet\u2019s emergence as a social and economic force. Its Weibo service, once derided by critics as a knockoff of Twitter, has grown in size and functionality to the point where it is now a must-read for many people.That separate listing helped set off the fight with Aristeia. Sina\u2019s shares have risen nearly 75 percent so far this year. But Weibo\u2019s performance has been better, with the stock more than doubling. Based on their stock market values, Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina \u2014 a gap that Aristeia says points to lackluster management and poor corporate governance.Sina uses a V.I.E. structure. Only one of the five director seats is available each year. The chairman and chief executive, Charles Chao, has a permanent position; the other members serve four-year terms.Aristeia is pushing for representation on the board so that directors will consider measures that would result in more money for shareholders. These include a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo or a buyback of shares by management.Sina says that any deal proposed by Aristeia would not clear because of China\u2019s complicated telecom and media rules. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, also owns a stake in Weibo, further complicating its options, Sina said.\u201cThe time, resources and capital invested to pursue a transaction with a high likelihood of failure, rather than accretive and value creating opportunities, is not in the best interests of Sina shareholders,\u201d Sina said in a statement.Some outsiders disagree. \u201cI think Sina has built in Weibo a very valuable asset that is not being reflected in its share price,\u201d said Randy Gelber, a managing director at UBS, the Swiss bank.\u201cIt would seem like there should be some common ground from both sides on how to realize that value,\u201d he said.Two proxy advisers \u2014 Glass Lewis & Company and International Shareholder Services \u2014 have given some weight to Aristeia\u2019s arguments. Glass Lewis recommended that Sina expand its board to allow Aristeia\u2019s nominees, and I.S.S. recommended that Sina shareholders support one of the two nominees.\u201cAn examination of the arguments reveals compelling reasons for shareholders to seek change at the company,\u201d I.S.S. said.It is also unfolding as the Chinese government looks to take a more active role in how its corporate giants are managed.Even if Aristeia emerges victorious, the real test could be whether its candidates will be able to push for change internally.\u201cThe question is whether that board member would be able to do anything other than jump up and down at meetings,\u201d said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management.videoAdvertisement"}

They lived in the same town in North Korea, Hyesan, but never met there, and left under very different circumstances.We recently spoke to both students about their transition to New York from one of the world\u2019s most repressive governments.What about life in New York surprised you?\u201cI had seen paintings in school of Americans, with big noses, blue eyes, and they looked liked really evil monsters,\u201d Ms. Park said. \u201cI thought they were one race. But when I came to New York, people all look so different, and they are New Yorkers, they are Americans. It really touched me that this is a kind of dream place where we can all live peacefully.\u201d\u201cWhen I was in North Korea I watched a lot of anti-America propaganda documentaries and I have really powerful memories of the Statue of Liberty, of that women holding the torch, and of North Korea condemning it,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil recently, I saw it in a totally different context. Now, learning the history of so many people immigrating and coming to America to find freedom, it\u2019s a wonderful kind of thing.\u201dWhat should Americans know about life in North Korea?\u201cHave you ever seen the movie \u2018The Truman Show?\u2019\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s like that. No one tells you the truth and you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u201cThere are also people like me who have a business mind, or who don\u2019t rely on the government propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cThat social change is happening now in North Korea, but those changes are not yet strong enough to upset the system.\u201dHow can the situation in North Korea be improved?\u201cWithout China, there\u2019s no North Korea. There\u2019s no Kim,\u201d she said.\u201cThe real weapon of North Korea is the isolation of the people. The international community needs to find some way to engage with the North Korean people.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Fall days don\u2019t get much better than this.That\u2019s not all. A string of sunny and mild days will take us through the weekend.New Yorkers can see the work of North Korean artists this week.So the forum made the best of the situation and asked the three North Koreans to take photographs of cityscapes and museums in Beijing. They also asked a South Korean artist, Zaun Lee, to shoot similar spaces in London and Athens and a Chinese artist, Shen Yang, to snap the same in New York.\u201cThe North Koreans were very interested in children, monuments, and statues of powerful people,\u201d Mr. Hostetter said.The Chinese and South Korean artists expressed broader interests, Mr. Hostetter added. \u201cThey were more interested in architecture and ordinary people in the street.\u201dFor last Thursday\u2019s opening, diplomats from North Korea, South Korea and the United States were invited to attend.To Mr. Hostetter\u2019s surprise, representatives from both North and South Korea made appearances.\u201cBut they declined our offer to introduce them to each other,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Hostetter said, he has hope that the two sides will eventually meet.\u201cWe\u2019ll be trying again at the closing.\u201dThe free exhibition is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10 p.m. to 4 p.m. on the weekends.

{"Headline": "Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies? Don\u2019t Bet on It", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. They\u2019re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won\u2019t.The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives \u2014 when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms \u2014 Americans turned to their government for a fix.Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants\u2019 power through government \u2014 and, if so, how.On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five \u2014 Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.But there is little to suggest we\u2019ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants\u2019 vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.\u201cIndividuals, lawmakers, we\u2019re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable \u2014 so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.\u201cOur firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cFolks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I\u2019d bet a lot of money a year from now we\u2019ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.\u201dPart of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we\u2019ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They\u2019re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five\u2019s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.\u201cWe\u2019ve all become a bit cyborg,\u201d writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d one of several new books examining the giants. \u201cWhat we need to always remember is that we\u2019re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.\u201dYet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it\u2019s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn\u2019t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn\u2019t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government\u2019s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company\u2019s culture \u2014 which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today\u2019s tech giants. But that\u2019s a big if.\u201cThe big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cHad we been more diligent, we wouldn\u2019t have nearly the problems we have today.\u201dFollow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

In the second episode of \u201cLife on Mars\u201d we find out how they are settling in \u2014 and how they clean the toilet.Episode 3: At Home in the HabitatThe crew has been in isolation for more than four months, the halfway point of their mission. In the third episode of \u201cLife on Mars,\u201d the crew shows us around the 1,200-square-foot habitat, which is outfitted with more than 150 sensors that collect data on water usage, battery power, carbon dioxide levels and other resources. These are analyzed by researchers and monitored by mission support to assess the well-being of the crew.Episode 4: The Crew Answers Your QuestionsIn the fourth episode of this 360-video series, the crew answers select audience questions, including what they miss most during their eight-month isolation, how they resolve conflict and if they still would go to Mars.Episode 5: Mirages of EarthIn the fifth episode of the series, see how the crew uses virtual reality as a coping mechanism for stress caused by isolation. The scenes are meant to relax crew members through exposure to natural and urban environments._________\u201cReady?\u201d\u201cReady.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cSoon.\u201d\u201cDo the scientists really know? Will it happen today, will it?\u201cLook, look; see for yourself!\u201dThe children pressed to each other like so many roses, so many weeds, intermixed, peering out for a look at the hidden sun.It rained. It had been raining for seven years; thousands upon thousands of days compounded and filled from one end to the other with rain, with the drum and gush of water, with the sweet crystal fall of showers and the concussion of storms so heavy they were tidal waves come over the islands. A thousand forests had been crushed under the rain and grown up a thousand times to be crushed again. And this was the way life was forever on the planet Venus and this was the schoolroom of the children of the rocket men and women who had come to a raining world to set up civilization and live out their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s stopping. It\u2019s stopping!\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dMargot stood apart from them, from these children who could never remember a time when there wasn\u2019t rain and rain and rain. They were all nine years old, and if there had been a day, seven years ago, when the sun came out for an hour and showed its face to the stunned world, they could not recall. Sometimes, at night, she heard them stir, in remembrance and she knew they were dreaming and remembering gold or a yellow crayon or a coin large enough to buy the world with. She knew they thought they remembered a warmness, like a blushing in the face, in the body, in the arms and legs and trembling hands. But then they always awoke to the tatting drum, the endless shaking down of clear bead necklaces upon the roof, the walk, the gardens, the forests, and their dreams were gone.The story continues:\u201cYou\u2019re lying, you don\u2019t remember!\u201d cried the children.But she remembered and stood quietly apart from all of them and watched the patterning windows. And once, a month ago, she had refused to shower in the school shower rooms, had clutched her hands to her ears and over her head, screaming the water mustn\u2019t touch her head. So after that, dimly, dimly, she sensed it, she was different and they knew her difference and kept away.There was talk that her father and mother were taking her back to Earth next year; it seemed vital to her that they do so, though it would mean the loss of thousands of dollars to her family. And so, the children hated her for all these reasons of big and little consequence. They hated her pale snow face, her waiting silence, her thinness, and her possible future.\u201cGet away!\u201d The boy gave her another push. \u201cWhat\u2019re you waiting for?\u201dThen for the first time, she turned and looked at him. And what she was waiting for was in her eyes. \u201cWell, don\u2019t wait around here!\u201d cried the boy savagely. \u201cYou won\u2019t see nothing!\u201d\u201cAll a joke!\u201d said the boy, and seized her roughly. \u201cHey, everyone, let\u2019s put her in a closet before teacher comes!\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d said Margot, falling back.They surged about her, caught her up and bore her, protesting, and then pleading, and then crying, back into a tunnel, a room, a closet, where they slammed and locked the door. They stood looking at the door and saw it tremble from her beating and throwing herself against it. They heard her muffled cries. Then, smiling, they turned and went out and back down the tunnel, just as the teacher arrived.\u201cReady, children?\u201d She glanced at her watch.\u201cYes!\u201d said everyone.\u201cAre we all here?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe rain slackened still more.They crowded to the huge door.The rain stopped.__________________Fact or Fiction? For centuries, authors have taken a fantastic and speculative approach to writing stories about life beyond Earth\u2019s bounds. The \u201cred planet\u201d and its many fictive Martian characters have served to supply the content of many science fiction stories over the years.More recently author Andy Weir chronicled a tale of Mars explorers that reflects more accurately the challenges astronauts would face today. \u201cThe Martian\u201d follows the life and struggle of the sole survivor of the first manned mission to Mars. Similar to how Bradbury originally published the stories of \u201cThe Martian Chronicles\u201d in serial form, \u201cThe Martian\u201d by Mr. Weir was first released one chapter at a time on his personal blog, which he later compiled and self-published in 2011 as an e-book on Amazon.com at the lowest possible price \u2014 99\u00a2. After quickly rising to the top of Amazon\u2019s science fiction best seller list, it was picked up by Crown Publishing Group. By 2014 \u201cThe Martian\u201d debuted on the Times best seller list. At the time of debut, Mr. Weir was already in negotiations with 20th Century Fox over the story\u2019s film rights. Starring Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain, the movie version premiered in 2015, eventually won two Golden Globes and was nominated for seven Oscars. See the official trailer, below.Because we can only speculate about life on other planets, what must science fiction authors consider when writing human stories in fantastic settings? How did the available sources of information about space vary when Bradbury wrote his science fiction stories in the 1950s compared to what was available to Mr. Weir as he was writing in the 21st century? To make their work compelling and accessible to the reader, how must authors walk the line between fantasy and the familiar? Is science-fiction a genre that is appealing to you? Why or why not?_________ Support for Space Exploration from One Administration to the NextEarly NASA initiatives received robust support during the 1960s because of the political climate. The Cold War conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union created an environment where advances in space exploration represented both military dominance as well as social and cultural prowess. The space race was a way that these two countries could flex their muscles without heating up the rivalry to outright war with one another.Based on what you read in these articles, compare and contrast Mr. Obama\u2019s and Mr. Trump\u2019s commitments to NASA\u2019s endeavors.

It was my own country, and the conveniences that we take for granted had collapsed. Traffic lights went black and commerce shut down.Streets that were normally filled with tourists in the charming towns of wine country were deserted except for crews of exhausted firefighters, sheriff\u2019s deputies and a few reporters. In the evacuation zones, rows of destroyed houses made it feel like a country at war, emptied of its civilian population.Small fires seemed to pop up everywhere. As I raced down narrow country roads to meet deadlines, I caught glimpses of smoldering embers on tree stumps a few feet away. I felt vulnerable while driving through tunnels of vegetation \u2014 it would be easy to be surrounded by fire and trapped.Everything smelled of smoke: my clothes, my car, my bag, my fingers.I feel enormously grateful to the dozens of people who took the time to articulate their grieving, some while standing in the rubble of their homes.

Their kitchens, their exercise equipment, their hobbies \u2014 their lives \u2014 were in cinders at our feet.It is a reporter\u2019s job to bring empathy to disasters like this.

{"Headline": "With Deal-Making in the Doldrums, Goldman Tries Something New", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoldman Sachs is trying to extricate itself from a box by thinking outside it. The Wall Street firm has set up a small team in what\u2019s known internally as the Innovation Lab, to cook up supposedly clever ideas for big clients. The resulting acquisitions may end up destroying value for the shareholders of the companies involved, but Goldman\u2019s own investors should be pleased the investment bank is trying new things.Giving advice is at the core of the $94 billion institution run by Lloyd C. Blankfein, which routinely ranks atop the closely watched league tables. Clients, like the ride-hailing service Uber and e-commerce giant Amazon, turn to Goldman for assistance. Competition is fierce, though, especially since smaller shops started gobbling more market share after the financial crisis. And fees are shrinking.Deal-making in the United States is equivalent to 6 percent of total company market value, according to data collated by Credit Suisse. That\u2019s stubbornly below the historical average of 9 percent. Adding to the sense of urgency perhaps is Goldman\u2019s trading operation. It makes up a bigger share of the bank\u2019s top line, and has been lackluster.Revenue from buying and selling bonds, yen, oil and the like fell 40 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. The quarterly earnings report due next week is likely to be glum again amid low levels of volatility.Adding some luster to the mergers-and-acquisition franchise therefore makes sense. The trouble is that for a big institution, small initiatives can take years to show results. Goldman is also growing its retail-bank offering, Marcus, which could generate returns on equity that surpass 15 percent, it says \u2014 but is still too small to require separate disclosure. That, and Goldman\u2019s plans to freshen up its trading arm, will command far more attention than whatever may come out of the Innovation Lab. At this point, though, experimentation is to be encouraged.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banning \u2018Bump Stocks\u2019 Won\u2019t Solve Anything", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Congress and even the National Rifle Association seem on the verge of a breakthrough: regulating the so-called bump stocks used in that killing spree, aftermarket devices that effectively turn legal, semiautomatic rifles into deadly, automatic weapons of war.Whenever the N.R.A. embraces a gun-control measure, it\u2019s worth looking further under the hood. And, in fact, a ban on bump stocks falls into the same trap as so many previous attempts at \u201csensible\u201d gun control have \u2014 it treats a symptom, but not the disease. As with the assault-weapons ban, it\u2019s not how the gun looks that matters; it\u2019s how it works.While the Las Vegas massacre was remarkable for its spree of fire, it fit a pattern: Many mass shootings involve rifles designed for automatic fire for the military, the design of which has then been modified to operate as legal, semiautomatic weapons for the civilian market \u2014 the AR-15, related to the military\u2019s M-16, being the most famous, but not the only, example.Civilian ownership of machine guns, which fire continuously as long as the trigger is pulled, has been restricted in the United States since 1934. But their semiautomatic equivalents, which fire just once with each pull of the trigger but to a casual observer look no different from the military versions, have become wildly popular. At my local gun store Thursday, there were as many semiautomatic, military-style weapons as anything; indeed, more than traditional deer-hunting guns shaped from steel and walnut. A beautiful Brazilian over-and-under shotgun-rifle combination sat in a corner, underpriced and apparently unloved. (I personally don\u2019t understand it; having been issued an M-16 by Uncle Sam in the summer of 1983, I cannot think of another firearm I\u2019d less like to lug into the woods on the first day of hunting season.)But again, aesthetics don\u2019t matter. And while most gun owners might be happy with keeping their rifles as semiautomatic, the proliferation of modification kits, books and YouTube videos demonstrates that many are eager to effectively convert them to automatics. Bump stocks are just the cheapest, simplest way to make a semiautomatic rifle act like an automatic.Open up, say, a Winchester 94, a .30-30 rifle \u2014 a so-called lever-action rifle, popular with deer hunters \u2014 and you\u2019ll find about six mostly flat, stamped metal parts held together with springs and pins. Open up an M-16 or its AR-15 civilian cousin and you\u2019ll find something else entirely: a tubular metal bolt, which slides back with the expulsion of gas as the bullet goes off, allowing the spring-fed magazine beneath to pop another round in place behind the chamber; the returning bolt then pushes it into place.The only real difference between the military and civilian versions is that the M-16 bolt is longer, and the stamped-metal components lock when set to automatic fire, allowing it to fire scores of bullets in several seconds. (Some claim the M-16 can fire up to 700 rounds a minute, but that\u2019s true only in theory; in practice, the rate is limited by magazine size, among other things.)Or take the hottest new rifle, the HK416, originally designed for the German military. A semiautomatic version of the original, the MR556, is available to civilians for a cool $2,800 and up. I know someone who spent $10,000 on two of them. To sell to civilians, the manufacturer, Heckler & Koch, made fairly minor modifications. Its receiver \u2014 where bullet, trigger, bolt and barrel meet \u2014 is the same as the military version\u2019s. But the trigger mechanisms inside, known as the trigger group, are attached differently in the civilian version, and a U-shaped metal ledge is removed.True, a good gunsmith will tell you that while it can be done, converting a semi-automatic military-origin rifle to an automatic isn\u2019t necessarily easy. The main obstacle is that you have to make a number of parts at home, and if you don\u2019t mill them correctly, they can break under the intense heat and pressure of automatic fire. But it\u2019s not impossible, and not surprisingly, the sort of gun owners attracted to these sorts of weapons are often the ones with the patience and machine-shop prowess to give it a go.The only solution, it seems, is to extend the ban on automatic weapons to include gas-powered, semiautomatic rifles that are merely modified versions of their military analogues. Semiautomatic pistols, which don\u2019t meet that criteria and are hard to convert, would be unaffected, as would shotguns, bolt-action rifles and lever-action rifles. But after Las Vegas, we can\u2019t close our eyes to the ease with which someone can unleash automatic weapon fire on a crowd of people. Nor can we pretend that banning just one conversion technique will solve the problem.Richard Parker is the author of \u201cLone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bowing to the Inevitable, Advertisers Embrace Advocate Role", "Date": "2017-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, advertisers have striven to stay away from any topic that might prove controversial or divisive. Times have changed.That was a recurring theme during the recently concluded Advertising Week New York, an annual industry conference in Manhattan that has turned into its own global enterprise. (Next year, regional versions of the event will be held in Mexico City, London, Tokyo and Sydney.)The responsibility of companies, particularly advertisers, to advocate on social issues and to provide a moral compass in a fraught political environment came up repeatedly during the week.While appearing on a panel of chief executives discussing diversity and inclusion, J. Clifford Hudson, the chief executive of Sonic Drive-In, which franchises its restaurants and is based in Oklahoma City, said he has been stymied on how public to be about efforts made within his company after a report last year showed that more Sonic customers associated with President Trump than any other presidential candidate. That was \u201cto my surprise,\u201d he said, \u201cwith believe me, no effort on our part whatsoever.\u201dMr. Hudson said he was proud that most of his senior team is made up of either women or ethnic minorities but he has wondered, \u201cDo I do that quietly or do I become more public about it?\u201d He added, \u201cThe for-profit private sector is going to be playing a stronger role in the next number of years at trying to reset the bar, for fear that the bar shifts in such a way that it\u2019s not healthy for society.\u201dA separate panel focused on the representation of women in commercials and highlighted recent research from the advertising company J. Walter Thompson New York and the Geena Davis Institute that showed men get far more screen time in ads compared with women, who are less likely to be depicted as funny or even employed.\u201cPeople don\u2019t trust government and big authorities, they\u2019re looking for companies to take courageous stands and really do more good in the world,\u201d said Debra Bass, president of global marketing services at Johnson & Johnson Consumer. \u201cWe know advertising creates stereotypes which shape culture and it\u2019s our responsibility to change culture so more women will have education and economic empowerment and less abuse.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in an environment where, wherever you stand on the political spectrum, I think it\u2019s clear to all of us right now that we\u2019re looking to actors outside of our government to help drive the social justice agenda,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. \u201cTo be part of an organization like ours and in this partnership with the N.F.L. is allowing us to start to do that.\u201dBoth companies have been smarting lately. Major brands like AT&T and Coca-Cola pulled ads from YouTube earlier this year after they were discovered on videos promoting offensive content like hate speech. More recently, Facebook disclosed that Russians had used fake accounts and online ads to fan divisive issues during the presidential campaign. The social network has also had to respond to the revelation that advertisers were able to target users who used terms like \u201cJew hater\u201d to describe themselves.Still, video is too enticing for issues like those to scare advertisers away.\u201cYou just have what I would actually liken to a gold rush in the content space,\u201d Rob Master, vice president of global media, categories and partnerships at Unilever, which owns brands like Dove soap and Lipton tea, said during a presentation. \u201cThe amount of money pouring into producing and developing content is unbelievable,\u201d he said, naming Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Fox and Hulu.Marketers are watching that, as well as how younger generations are using their smartphones, and figuring out where they might fit in, he said.\u201cWhat is the commercial model for a video on a phone or on the web across these different platforms?\u201d Mr. Master said. \u201cToday, some platforms call video what I would call a digital moving billboard. So how do we think about that in terms of media \u2014 how do you plan or buy for that?\u201dThere were also, of course, discussions that did not touch on seismic industry or societal shifts.During a panel on Instagram, the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, who sells goods under a namesake label, described how she decides to make work-related posts to her highly-followed account.\u201cI feel sort of honor-bound to the people who follow me to not exploit the relationship, not to trade on the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel better talking about the business on our business pages frankly.\u201d But when it does happen, she said, \u201cI try to be very thoughtful and plot out those occasions where I invade the personal with business.\u201dImran Khan, Snap\u2019s chief strategy officer, said that Snapchat users were creating more than three billion pictures and videos a day.\u201cThe problem with text is that text never captured your true voice \u2014 text might grab your attention but it never captured your imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, the way we communicate is changing, it\u2019s becoming visual. With texting, I always had to translate my feelings over text. Now with camera, I can do that instantly.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the announcement of a settlement between the California attorney general\u2019s office and Gatorade.

{"Headline": "A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe moment I laid eyes on Daffodil, I vowed I would give her a good home.Once my adoption application was approved, I scooped Daffy up, jumped in a cab and headed uptown to my one-bedroom apartment in Harlem, prepared to give her the best \u201cforever home\u201d possible.And so I set to work turning a 4-by-9-foot walk-in closet outside my bedroom into a bunny room. I filled it with plenty of hiding spots, toys, litter boxes (domestic rabbits can be litter box-trained), a bi-level bunny condo and a little four-poster bed. I painted grass and flowers on the walls and hung art. I hoped all of this would make the room feel warm and safe to the bunnies.It felt like the obvious thing to do for any loved one under my roof, four-legged or not. In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room \u2014 albeit a very small one \u2014 to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets \u2014 even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.19 PhotosThe space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to \u201cdefine the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.\u201dWhile Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn\u2019t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.Along with an en-suite bathroom \u2014 good for quick water refills and easy cleanup \u2014 the dog\u2019s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. \u201cIt\u2019s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,\u201d Ms. Weber said. \u201cI tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He\u2019s in there all of the time by choice.\u201dBut even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend\u2019s college-age sons won\u2019t have to sleep in Chauncey\u2019s room when they visit.Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they\u2019re not with her.Ms. Stern\u2019s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. \u201cIt\u2019s an animal-friendly building,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople stop by to visit; they know they\u2019re lucky pets.\u201dSuch devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.\u201cMargaux\u2019s a big dog,\u201d Mrs. Griffiths said. \u201cWe needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn\u2019t feel trapped or anxious.\u201d The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.And why not?As Mrs. Griffiths said, \u201cMargaux is just like any other member of our family.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "CVS Is Said to Be in Talks to Buy Aetna in Landmark Acquisition", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCVS Health, the giant drugstore chain that also runs walk-in clinics and a pharmacy benefit business, is in talks to buy Aetna, one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurance companies, according to people briefed on the talks.Negotiations between the two companies could still fall apart, these people say. But if consummated, the deal could be worth more than $60 billion based on Aetna\u2019s current market value, which would make it one of the largest corporate acquisitions this year and one of the largest in the history of the health industry.The proposed combination reflects the blurring of traditional boundaries in health care, as established companies seek to find their footing in a rapidly changing environment. Congress is deadlocked over the future of the Affordable Care Act, and employers and consumers are struggling to contain rising medical costs, particularly skyrocketing drug prices.\u201cI think this deal has been a long time coming,\u201d said Adam J. Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, a management advisory and business research company. \u201cCVS has been positioning itself as a health care company and not a pharmacy for a long time.\u201dThe negotiations are also taking place as the online retail giant Amazon encroaches on the turf of well-established players \u2014 and the pharmacy business could be next. In industries ranging from book sales to groceries to television programming, Amazon has displaced stalwarts that had enjoyed decades of limited competition and rarely interrupted growth.A larger company \u2014 CVS and Aetna have combined annual revenues of about $240 billion \u2014 could enjoy greater leverage in negotiations with drug companies, helping it defend itself against newcomers like Amazon.\u201cThe intensifying battle for negotiating power and market share will lead companies to do acquisitions across traditional industry boundary lines,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan who studies the drug industry. \u201cPharmacies, drug wholesalers and benefit managers are trembling at the prospect of competing with Amazon.\u201dAlthough it is best known for its chain of storefront pharmacies, it is also one of the nation\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers and operates one of the country\u2019s biggest specialty pharmacies, which sells high-priced drugs that often require special handling. The company also runs walk-in MinuteClinics in its pharmacies and Target stores around the country.Mr. Fein said the acquisition of Aetna, if it went through, would mark an industry shift toward a more seamless approach to managing health care costs. Right now, insurers are typically responsible for managing a patient\u2019s medical bills and outsource the coverage of prescription drugs to a pharmacy benefit manager like CVS. Mr. Fein said that because the fastest-growing part of the pharmacy industry was high-priced specialty drugs for people who have considerable medical needs, \u201cit makes sense to manage those within one coordinated organization.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a strategic play,\u201d agreed Paul Keckley, a longtime industry consultant, who said CVS\u2019s goal was not necessarily to be in the insurance business but to offer the ability to manage both medical and pharmacy costs for large employers. In addition to its insurance business, Aetna has partnerships with numerous large health systems and a sophisticated technology operation.The resulting company could resemble UnitedHealth Group, which has a large insurance operation but also runs a leading pharmacy benefit manager, OptumRx, and related health service businesses.\u201cAetna\u2019s come out of this Humana scenario with some urgency,\u201d Mr. Keckley said.Reed Abelson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buy a Sofa Online? Wayfair Is Counting on It", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly on a fall morning, the sweat was already beading on Sean Williams\u2019s brow as he and his partner wrestled with a problem worthy of a geometry class: figuring out the series of lifts, tilts and tugs needed to squeeze a sectional sofa through the front door of a New Jersey home.Just a few days earlier, Jeanne Korchak had found the perfect L-shaped sectional for her Fair Haven home from a website run by the online home furnishings giant Wayfair. Now it was up to Mr. Williams to flawlessly deliver and assemble the sectional. A single rip or ding and Wayfair would wind up taking the furniture back.After Mr. Williams declared he was done, Mrs. Korchak stepped into the room, her eyes zeroing in on a beige sofa cushion. \u201cIs that a stain?\u201d she asked. The room fell silent.These days, ordering a shirt or a pair of shoes online and having them delivered to your home is easy. And while online grocery delivery may occasionally result in a broken egg or melted ice cream, it\u2019s hardly the end of the world.But ordering big, expensive furniture \u2014 a sofa, dining room table or mattress \u2014 online is a more complex challenge. Is that chair more teal or more turquoise? It\u2019s hard to tell through the pixels. Do the cushions feel like you\u2019re sitting on a cloud or on a boulder?And that\u2019s before the demanding task of delivery. Oversize couches meet small door frames. Fragile crystal chandeliers meet floors. Vanities are the bane of all deliverymen, managing to be both bulky, weighing hundreds of pounds, and delicate, with easily scratched or nicked tops.This is the knotty space that Wayfair is trying to own.This year, Boston-based Wayfair will sell around $4 billion worth of ceiling fans, dog beds, espresso machines, hot tubs and artificial Christmas trees (around 55,000 sold in the last 12 months) online. That\u2019s nearly double what it sold two years ago and just a little less than the home furnishings giant Williams-Sonoma, which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm.It\u2019s a growth story that has proved irresistible to Wall Street; Wayfair\u2019s stock price has more than doubled this year, to $71.But the big question hovering over Wayfair is whether the company can ever make money by delivering bulk furniture virtually for free. The company is expected to lose nearly $200 million this year and has been a favorite of short sellers, betting that the company\u2019s stock price will fall.Most major furniture retailers will charge at least $130 to deliver a couch. But Wayfair will ship or deliver any purchases costing $49 or more for free, bringing large pieces of furniture into the entrance of your home. (Taking the item to a specific room or assembling it costs extra.) And if the order is damaged or if the customer simply doesn\u2019t like the color, Wayfair says, it will take the item back.Noting that Wayfair\u2019s profit margins are considerably less than those of its competitors and that Amazon has signaled its interest in the space, some analysts argue that it may be difficult for Wayfair to produce profits. There has also been speculation in the industry that Amazon or Walmart could acquire Wayfair.\u201cIt feels like 1999,\u201d said Andrew Left, the executive editor of Citron Research, who has bet that Wayfair\u2019s stock will fall. That was when the stocks of dot-coms and e-commerce firms soared, even though the vast majority were unprofitable.Wayfair argues that the margins of its competitors, like Restoration Hardware or Williams-Sonoma, are higher because they are building extra profit into their pricing. A sofa from another company may start at $1,000, but Wayfair sells its sofas at an average price of $600, a spokeswoman said.Wayfair also noted that its earnings in the United States before taxes and other expenses had been positive this year, and said its net losses were due to its investments in its international businesses.Wayfair was founded by Niraj Shah and Steve Conine, friends and engineers who graduated from Cornell University in 1995. Within three years, the pair had sold their first company, an information technology consulting business, for $10 million.But in 2002, as dot-coms collapsed, the two men noticed that small, specialized online retailers were still growing at a rapid clip.\u201cOne lady had a website selling birdhouses that she stored in the garage,\u201d Mr. Shah said in an interview. \u201cShe was looking to sell her business because she couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand.\u201dSo the two men started racksandstands.com, a website selling, well, stands and racks for televisions. In its first four months, the site amassed $400,000 in sales.By 2010, the company was an incongruous collection of 270 websites, from cookware.com to everygrandfatherclock.com to outdoorrugs.com. So Mr. Shah and Mr. Conine consolidated the sites under one digital umbrella, and ultimately called it Wayfair.Today, sitting under that umbrella is a dizzying array of more than eight million products. The company offers 7,328 types of coffee tables, 106,430 different area rugs (20,073 of them blue) and 759 different standing coat racks.To help customers wade through its virtual bazaar, Wayfair has some of its 1,000 software engineers constantly developing new features for its app. One allows consumers to snap a photo of an item, a couch or chair, that Wayfair then matches with products on its website. Another recently released feature produces a 3-D image of the Wayfair product, allowing consumers to see how a piece looks in a room and, perhaps more important, whether it will fit the room\u2019s dimensions.But many traditional retailers argue that furniture remains a category where consumers will be reluctant to buy solely online.\u201cHaving a real-world presence, we believe, is a competitive advantage,\u201d said Marta Benson, the president of Pottery Barn.While about half of the revenues for Williams-Sonoma come from online sales, Ms. Benson noted that plenty of customers \u201cwant to sit, touch and feel some categories before they purchase.\u201dStill, investors have rewarded Wayfair\u2019s explosive growth since the company went public in 2014. With its soaring share price, Wayfair has a market capitalization of $6.2 billion. That\u2019s $2 billion more than Williams-Sonoma\u2019s valuation.But a big difference is that Williams-Sonoma is profitable, making $300 million last year.In an effort to bring down some of its costs, Wayfair has spent much of the past year changing its shipping and delivery models.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing it in-house,\u201d said Sharif Sleiman, Wayfair\u2019s head of supply chain and operations as he strolled through one of two new warehouses that Wayfair has built just outside Princeton, N.J.The combined warehouses \u2014 the size of 17 football fields, with racks that stretch 40 feet to the ceiling \u2014 hold some of Wayfair\u2019s most popular smaller household items and furniture, from scrub brushes to lamps, that can be shipped throughout the Northeast on United Parcel Service or FedEx trucks.\u201cWe\u2019re able to deliver faster, within one or two days,\u201d Mr. Sleiman said, \u201cand we\u2019re seeing less damage.\u201dBut delivering the bigger pieces of furniture is much trickier. A year ago, all of the \u201clast mile\u201d warehouse facilities were run by third parties. But concerns about inconsistent customer service and damaged tables and beds prompted Wayfair to take over half of the facilities, trying to infuse a sense of teamwork and enthusiasm among its workers.\u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d shouted a group of two dozen deliverymen standing in a Wayfair warehouse in Linden, N.J., about 10 miles south of Newark, at 4:38 on a recent morning.\u201cLouder,\u201d the team leader demanded.A few minutes later, the group broke up, allowing Sean Williams and the other drivers to check their deliveries and routes for the day.Mr. Williams and the others are employed by a third-party freight delivery firm, but Wayfair puts the drivers through extensive customer training, shows them how to handle fragile items and gives them bonuses for good customer feedback.Mr. Williams\u2019s first delivery that morning \u2014 dropping off and assembling a cocktail table \u2014 went smoothly. But in Fair Haven, he hit a snag with the sectional sofa.On this day, at least, Wayfair escaped the fate of returned furniture. A few dabs with a baby wipe and the mark on the cushion disappeared.Mrs. Korchak declared that she was pleased with her purchase, and, about 30 minutes after he had arrived, Mr. Williams pulled the truck out, headed for his next delivery.Advertisement"}
