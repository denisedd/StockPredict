{"Headline": "As Apple and Facebook Chiefs Visit, Xi Jinping Vows Deeper Reform", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Just days after being likened to a king by President Trump, President Xi Jinping of China on Monday reiterated his commitment to reform while holding court before a group of wealthy and influential business leaders from his country and the United States.Mr. Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during an event shown on national television, addressed topics such as globalization, innovation and China\u2019s relationship with the United States at a gathering of executives who included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple; Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group; and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive.The reception was one of Mr. Xi\u2019s first public appearances with foreign visitors since a key Chinese Communist Party congress elevated him to the same exalted status as Mao Zedong, the country\u2019s founding father, and Deng Xiaoping, who led the country from 1978 until 1989.The event \u2014 just a week before Mr. Trump is scheduled to make his first visit to China \u2014 was most likely arranged to signal China\u2019s status as an economic superpower and peer of the United States.Chinese diplomats have used past business summits to promote their country\u2019s economic clout and influence with American companies before testier meetings with United States leaders and diplomats. On a 2015 trip to the United States, for example, Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle to visit American technology executives before going to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama.On Monday, Mr. Xi used his remarks to promote his credentials as a leader following Deng\u2019s footsteps as an economic reformer and defender of global trade.International investors and business groups have grown increasingly skeptical about Mr. Xi\u2019s commitment to opening up the Chinese economy. The Chinese government, citing worries that foreign technology and companies could compromise the country\u2019s security, has fed those doubts by tightening restrictions over the internet and advanced technology.And even as Mr. Xi reiterated his commitment to reform, he emphasized that China\u2019s sovereignty and security were of paramount importance.\u201cChina will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and developmental interests, and at the same time adhere to a fundamental national policy of opening up,\u201d he said.For the executives attending the event on Monday, the restrictions are hitting the bottom line. Facebook remains mostly blocked in China despite the company\u2019s lobbying efforts. Apple said this year that it would build a data center in the country to conform with a new Chinese cybersecurity law.The moves by Beijing have prompted calls in Washington for added scrutiny of Chinese companies seeking to do business in the United States or buy up American technology companies. Such issues are unlikely to be addressed in the coming meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, experts said.Mr. Xi\u2019s appeal to the executives on Monday in some ways contrasted with Mr. Trump\u2019s clashes with the leaders of some American tech companies. Other executives attending the event included Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive; Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba; Pony Ma, Tencent\u2019s chief executive; and Terry Guo, the chief executive of Foxconn.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China to Debtors: Pay Up or Be Shamed", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Troubled by huge debts run up by big state companies and politically connected local governments, China is taking steps instead to go after the little guys.The new, official platforms could help China establish a centralized database of people it considers irresponsible. Details of loan defaults are often known only at the local or provincial level, said Hu Wenyou, a partner at Yingke, a law firm in Beijing. Sharing data on defaults would make it easier for reliable credit ratings for individuals to become available in China.\u201cThis is a step toward a credit society,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Large state-owned enterprises, widely viewed as too big to fail because of the employment they provide, have avoided defaults. That is in large part because they continue to get large loans from state-controlled banks, sometimes to help repay previous loans. Defaults by state-controlled companies have been extremely rare and confined to smaller firms.Details of how Chinese officials would manage the online platforms were scant. The reports said that China\u2019s banking regulator, the Supreme Court and the propaganda arm of the Communist Party had told local officials to complete the platforms by the end of the year and to make the public aware of the websites within two years. The China Banking Regulatory Commission declined to comment on Wednesday.Banks and other lenders regularly check the Supreme Court database, but they do not add their own data on late or disputed payments, and they share very little data with one another.China\u2019s online giants were not mentioned in official news reports about the plans, but experts say they are likely to play a major role in the establishment of nationwide credit-scoring systems. Ant Financial \u2014 an affiliate of the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant that trades in the United States \u2014 said it had set up its own credit rating system, Sesame Credit, which monitors the Supreme Court database without contributing to it.\u201cSesame Credit does not share user information with any third party without the consent of users,\u201d Ant Financial said on Wednesday. It declined to comment on the details of the move toward local and provincial databases.Chinese bankers say that the default rate for individual borrowers is very low in China, and that lenders have usually demanded a car or apartment as collateral before making the loan. The bulk of household lending in China consists of home mortgages, according to data from China\u2019s central bank. Personal loans are limited but rising, the data showed.Advertisement"}

The gap between the central government and local governments is still quite large.\u201d\u201cClearly, there\u2019s been a willingness to let these guys flourish but, at the same time, a desire to neutralize them as an independent political force,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a founding partner of the Beijing-based research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.Analysts say the state intervention has resulted in entrepreneurs\u2019 losing confidence in China\u2019s future. Private-sector investment has been weak, and many tycoons have parked their money abroad should they run afoul of the government.Many others choose to simply lie low. \u201cThe savvy entrepreneurs have already worked out which way the wind is blowing,\u201d said Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun\u2019s chairman.Mo Shaoping, a prominent human rights lawyer who represents Guo Junwen, said many of his entrepreneur clients were insecure. Looming over them is the fear that the government might make them pay for their \u201coriginal sin\u201d \u2014 crimes including bribery and fraud related to actions they took before China more clearly codified what is legal and what is not.Mr. Mo is skeptical about the government\u2019s claim to protect entrepreneurs, citing the lack of enforcement of private property rights. \u201cIn reality, the implementation of it has been terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to wastepaper.\u201dMr. Guo was one of China\u2019s new generation of entrepreneurs. In 1990, he toured the United States and was struck by its trappings of middle-class comfort. After that trip, he set up a computer company.He set up a real estate company in 1993 and moved into hotel management four years later, owning four hotels across China. His company, Chongqing Xiya Industrial Group, employed more than 3,000 people.He also built ties to government officials, but he felt he could not bridge the deep mistrust.\u201cSome officials who encounter entrepreneurs avoid us like we are the god of plague,\u201d Mr. Guo said.His troubles began in 2008 after he sold a real estate project to a politically connected buyer in Kunming. That investor was angered at how poorly his business was doing and wanted to get back at Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Guo and his lawyers. Officials in Kunming did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Guo\u2019s account of the dispute could not be independently verified.In 2014, prosecutors in Kunming impounded the company\u2019s hotels and real estate projects. In 2015, a court convicted Mr. Guo for illegally occupying farmland and sentenced him to two years in prison, according to court documents. He lost an appeal but was released in January 2016 for time served.Zhang Dongshuo, Mr. Guo\u2019s other lawyer, said the asset seizure violated Chinese law because the court never convicted his client of fraud. Most of the assets have been returned to Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Guo said the authorities had not returned $450,000 in cash, six villas in Kunming and three apartments in Chongqing.A party member for more than three decades, before he went into business, Mr. Guo said he was encouraged by the government\u2019s talk about entrepreneur rights. He said he looked forward to the day the party would elevate businesspeople to be senior politicians, citing President Trump as an example.\u201cLook at Trump, a businessman who could even become president,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cFor us to be like America in recognizing the importance of entrepreneurs, I think we still need a little more time.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

Mr. Xi created and empowered the cyberspace administration, which has subsumed many of the overlapping agencies that once governed content in cyberspace.The administration is now seen as an institution as important as the defense ministry. Since last year, it has been led by Xu Lin, 54, a party technocrat and former propaganda official, who, like other influential officials who previously worked beside Mr. Xi in Shanghai, has soared through the ranks.\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that technology has advanced more quickly than the government\u2019s ability to control it,\u201d Ms. Sacks said. Russia\u2019s interference with Facebook, to cite only one example, was \u201cjustification for exactly what they are doing here.\u201dThe tech firms also face tight penalties if they fail to keep users in line. In September, the cybersecurity administration imposed fines on social media platforms owned wholly or in part by three of China\u2019s biggest internet companies \u2014 Tencent Holdings, the Alibaba Group and Baidu \u2014 for failing to stop the circulation of fabricated rumors, violence and pornography. (Companies can be fined up to $76,000 per offense, and have their business licenses canceled, if they cannot prevent the transmission of banned content.)Still, China\u2019s advantage could be double-edged. Chinese internet companies have struggled to expand abroad, which experts say stems in part from their dependence on their government.Moreover, not all of the new restrictions have been welcomed here. Some of the companies \u2014 and internet users \u2014 balked at tightened enforcement of rules requiring users of social media platforms to provide their real identities to the companies (although they may still use online pseudonyms). Weibo\u2019s announcement that it was seeking 1,000 recruits to become supervisors to report illegal content online \u2014 the definitions of which can be expansive \u2014 was met by derision on its own site.\u201cOnline and offline, Big Brother is watching,\u201d wrote one user, who used the handle mingxinjianxing.But when it comes to the controversy over Russia\u2019s intervention, there has been little discussion here. Among the few who are discussing it on Weibo, some expressed shock that the United States does not censor information shared on social media platforms.Mr. Zhao, the young volunteer on Weibo, is typical of those here who believe government control is justified.In a restaurant called Europa, Mr. Zhao \u2014 who declined to disclose details of where and how he works \u2014 described China\u2019s system not as \u201cBig Brother\u201d so much as a younger brother, which he is, protecting children, like those of his sister, from harmful material.\u201cEven though the internet is virtual, it is still part of society,\u201d he added. \u201cSo in any space I feel no one should create pornographic, illegal or violent posts.\u201dIn his new capacity, he scours Weibo in search of the lurid and illicit. Some posts, he explained, are thinly veiled solicitations for pornography or prostitution, including one message he reported to the police the other day for using what he said was a euphemism for selling sex.When he reports abuse, it is the police who follow up. He excitedly displayed his smartphone to show the latest of his more than 3,000 followers on Weibo: the division of the Beijing police that monitors the internet.\u201cNormally, if you don\u2019t do bad things, you don\u2019t get followed by the police,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this \u2014 for someone who has been online for so many years \u2014 is really special.\u201dFollow Steven Lee Myers @stevenleemyers and Sui-Lee Wee @suilee on Twitter.Steven Lee Myers reported from Hulunbuir and Beijing, and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing.

Investors in the United States and China view the emerging middle class in India as an important market, and they want to back companies that can win over those customers.Ola, which is based in Bangalore, in southern India, said it planned to use the new funds to invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning to tackle projects such as predicting where and when a regular customer might need a car. The ride-hailing company is also spending heavily on a program to buy vehicles and lease them to drivers, and it is experimenting with electric cars in some cities.Uber\u2019s prices in India are generally lower than Ola\u2019s, an advantage in this price-sensitive country. Uber also benefits from the resources of a global company, including advanced mapping technology and an app that works in any of the dozens of countries in which it operates. Ola is in more Indian cities than Uber is, but it is unavailable outside India.Ola has been trying to break its cycle of operating losses by curbing discounts and driver incentives, while rolling out innovations to attract users.The company offers free Wi-Fi in many of its vehicles, and about a year ago, it introduced a premium subscription service for about $8 a month that gives frequent riders special benefits such as priority booking and an escape from surge pricing during times of peak demand.Ola also offers a range of vehicle options, from the three-wheeled auto-rickshaws that are extremely popular in India to the luxury sedans aimed at business executives and foreign visitors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Seeks Small Stakes in, and More Sway Over, Online Firms", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Some ambitious Chinese online media companies have won backing from a very powerful investor: the Chinese government itself.Two small companies \u2014 a military news site called Tiexue and a news aggregator called Zaker \u2014 have recently offered stakes to affiliates of the Chinese government or the Communist Party, according to company documents and official media. The deals are part of a government drive to exercise oversight over media companies through special shares that grant their holders outsize influence over management and content.The two firms are relatively small. And Chinese cyberspace regulators have been busy tightening controls in more forceful ways over the past few months ahead of an important Communist Party gathering set to begin next week.But the deals struck with the two online news companies could be a sign of things to come. The news media in China is becoming more difficult to police as readers and outlets migrate online and onto social media. Experts said that if the deals work, the authorities could eventually ask for stakes at some of the country\u2019s largest and most innovative companies in order to solidify influence over their services.The Chinese authorities traditionally have issued guidelines and outright orders to major internet companies about what they would like to see and not see online, said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a tech advisory firm in Beijing.\u201cAs these companies have grown both in size and influence,\u201d he said, \u201cthat model is no longer comfortable for the authorities.\u201dBoth companies and China\u2019s top cyberspace regulator declined to comment.In China as elsewhere, internet and social media platforms have become an increasingly popular source of news as smartphones have come to permeate every aspect of daily life. According to government statistics, more than four-fifths of China\u2019s more than 730 million internet users obtained some news online last year. More than 570 million people used news apps, up nearly one-fifth over the previous year.The recent share deals could take Beijing\u2019s involvement in online media a step further.The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, a powerful Chinese media regulator, recommended last year that the government take small but significant stakes in media companies. Called \u201cspecial management shares,\u201d these would represent a stake of as little as 1 percent. Still, they would give Chinese officials seats on company boards and the right to review media content.A spokeswoman for Tiexue declined to comment.A Zaker representative declined to comment. Shenzhen Press Group could not be reached for comment.Teng Bingsheng, a Shanghai-based professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, said a resurgence of economic nationalism in China is fueling concerns about the ownership of the country\u2019s technology companies, whose major shareholders sometimes include international private-equity firms.\u201cPeople look at their equity structure and they say, \u2018Wow, this is actually not a Chinese company because their largest shareholders are not Chinese,\u2019\u201d Mr. Teng said.The government\u2019s stakes in tech firms may be small at first, he said. \u201cBut once the door is opened, eventually they may ask for more.\u201dRaymond Zhong reported from Hong Kong, and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing.

On a nearby wall, printouts show the sorts of defects that customers have complained about in the past: overripe avocados, smelly spinach, rotten honeydews.\u201cIt\u2019s getting better and better,\u201d said Vikram Rupani, president of RedMart, an online grocery company based in Singapore that is part of Alibaba\u2019s push into the region, \u201cbut it\u2019s a continuous process that never ends.\u201dAlibaba and Amazon already dominate the business of selling stuff online in their home markets. Increasingly, they are competing against each other on neutral ground.Both are spending billions of dollars on Asia \u2014 particularly Southeast Asia and India \u2014 as they look for a place that could repeat China\u2019s explosive transformation into the world\u2019s biggest online shopping market.Amazon has committed $5 billion to India, where it lures customers to sign up for its Prime service, which includes Western movies and television shows, for a small fraction of the $99 annual membership price in the United States. Alibaba has invested roughly $500 million for stakes in both Paytm \u2014 India\u2019s largest mobile payments platform \u2014 and its e-commerce affiliate, Paytm Mall.Alibaba\u2019s bigger bet is in Southeast Asia. It has spent more than $2 billion to take control of Lazada, a five-year-old online shopping company based in Singapore and doing business in six countries. Last year, Lazada bought RedMart, the online retail grocery.Over about the same period, India\u2019s market could increase six times to a similar amount, Bain & Company, a consulting firm, projects.Alibaba and Amazon are seeking consumers like Janice Lee Fang, a Singaporean who decided she needed to buy a robot to amuse a 6-year-old daughter home sick from school.

Other places lack the roads and other infrastructure to get people what they need.\u201cIt\u2019s a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural areas, separated by large distances and \u2014 in the Philippines and Indonesia \u2014 by water,\u201d said Mike Booker, a partner at the Southeast Asian arm of Bain. \u201cCash on delivery is still prevalent, and other local players are in the fray.\u201dThe challenges have forced Lazada, Alibaba\u2019s biggest Southeast Asian operation, to get creative.In Vietnam, local post offices take customer returns and give cash refunds. In Malaysia, customers can collect merchandise from lockers at 7-Eleven stores. And in the Philippines, Lazada uses gas stations as places where merchants can drop off their goods for delivery personnel to pick up.\u201cWe\u2019re in the super, super, super early days,\u201d said Inanc Balci, who oversees Lazada operations in the Philippines.Alibaba\u2019s international arm has seen its latest quarterly sales more than double in a year, in part from Lazada\u2019s contribution. Still, Lazada and its RedMart subsidiary remain a tiny, and unprofitable, part of Alibaba\u2019s empire. Max Bittner, Lazada\u2019s chief executive, said its Chinese parent has been willing to spend money to build its delivery capabilities and draw more customers.\u201cE-commerce is an economy of scale game,\u201d Mr. Bittner said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel constrained in any way. I can go after this opportunity with the amount of firepower I need.\u201dAmazon so far counts Singapore as its only Southeast Asian market, though industry experts widely expect it will expand into other countries. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.Southeast Asia could offer a test of their vastly different business models on neutral turf.Alibaba has a long lead over Amazon and is building up its infrastructure across Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, for example, it took a minority stake in August in another online marketplace, Tokopedia. Experts say Amazon could fight back by offering online Western movies and television programs as it does in the United States, which could increase its appeal with younger customers.Amazon stumbled in Singapore initially when the service proved too popular, forcing it to turn away customers. But since then the two companies have amped up their efforts to deliver more quickly to a growing group of customers.At the RedMart warehouse on a recent visit, workers packed cartons \u2014 sometimes nine at a time \u2014 from bins holding piles of cereal boxes and canned fruits and vegetables. For those who offer ways to improve the process, merit awards include movie tickets, vouchers and cash of up to $1,000.Competing in the market is likely to be expensive, thanks to customer price cuts and rebates in addition to expansion costs.\u201cIt\u2019s fabulous,\u201d said Uma Parameswar, a Singaporean who works in fine arts management. Over two and a half years of using RedMart, she said, only once did she receive fruit that was less than fresh.The enticements make her even more inclined to shop online. She says RedMart gives her a 5 percent discount on grocery bills plus discounts on using Uber\u2019s ride-hailing and other services.\u201cIt\u2019s saved me probably $200 in the last three or four months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Tsai, has agreed in principle to buy a 49 percent stake in the Nets, people briefed on the deal said on Friday.The transaction between Mr. Tsai and the Nets\u2019 majority owner, the Russian mogul Mikhail D. Prokhorov, values the team at about $2.3 billion, including its existing debt, according to the people familiar with the deal. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.The sale does not include the Barclays Center, the $1 billion arena in which the team plays and which Mr. Prokhorov will keep.The Nets have had ups and downs under Mr. Prokhorov\u2019s ownership: They reached the Eastern Conference semifinals three years ago, but have fallen apart since then, crippled by a series of misguided player personnel moves.Under the terms of the agreement in principle, Mr. Tsai will not have any role in either the basketball or business sides of the Nets. Yet he will have the option \u2014 but not the obligation \u2014 to buy out Mr. Prokhorov at some point in the future.Mr. Tsai is buying the Nets stake with his own money, and he will carry on as Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, one of the people briefed on the matter said.A representative for Alibaba declined to comment.It is perhaps the most notable trophy acquisition yet for Mr. Tsai, a Taiwan-born lawyer who moved to the United States to attend high school, before attending Yale. He became a corporate lawyer and then a private equity executive. But it was a meeting in 1999 with Jack Ma, a former English teacher turned entrepreneur who had the idea for an e-commerce company, that set him on a path to wealth.Mr. Tsai helped build Alibaba into a titan of China\u2019s internet community, creating a company that earned $6.3 billion in profit and $23 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year. Its $25 billion initial public offering in 2014 was the biggest stock market debut in history.The acquisition is the latest example of an executive from a Chinese conglomerate \u2014 or a Chinese company itself \u2014 spending heavily to acquire pieces of sports properties, including the Premier League team Manchester City and other top clubs on the European continent. They have also invested in FIFA sponsorships and in companies that handle international broadcast and media rights.With a population of 1.3 billion people and a rising middle class with an unquenchable thirst for sports, China is considered a lucrative and largely untapped market for both consuming and participating in sports.But deals such as Dalian Wanda\u2019s $650 million purchase of the Ironman competition and its expansion into marathons and road races have been questioned by analysts for the high prices that have been agreed upon. Buyers from China and Chinese companies have also pumped money into everything from professional cricket to world snooker tournaments and cycling.In March, the Chinese government acknowledged that its companies had gone on a buying spree abroad, spending $225 billion in 2016, a record-breaking number. Commerce Minister Zhong Shan vowed to slow down what he called \u201cblind and irrational investment.\u201dZhou Xiaochuan, the country\u2019s top central banker, took particular aim at sports and entertainment acquisitions.\u201cSome are not in line with our requirements and policies for overseas investment, such as in sports, entertainment and clubs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis didn\u2019t bring much benefit to China and caused some complaints overseas.\u201dChinese investment in American teams has been met coolly by the major sports leagues and their owners.It is rare that professional sports teams go on the selling block, and leagues such as the N.F.L. and N.B.A. demand comprehensive information on who is buying into the club, and where their money came from, as well as assurances that it will continue to flow.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the Nets\u2019 majority owner, Mikhail D.

Alibaba\u2019s market cap is now $473 billion, while Tencent\u2019s is at $428 billion.

{"Headline": "U.S. Investor Tries to Shake Up Sina, a Pillar of China\u2019s Internet", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese internet boom has been good to Sina. Maybe, protests one of its American investors, it could have been better.Still, Sina finds itself embroiled in an unusual situation for a company with a surging stock price: a proxy fight. Aristeia Capital, a hedge fund based in Connecticut, is lobbying Sina shareholders to back its two candidates for the company\u2019s board in a bid to shake up Sina\u2019s business and give shareholders fatter returns. This week, the other shareholders will weigh in, casting their votes before a shareholder meeting set for Friday.Proxy fights in general are not uncommon, but one between a Chinese company and an American investor is the first of its kind, according to disclosures tracked by the data provider FactSet. And the campaign has helped to underscore the limits of foreign ownership of Chinese internet companies.Sina, one of the first Chinese tech companies to list its shares in New York, has called Aristeia \u201cself-serving\u201d and na\u00efve about how China\u2019s internet sector works.In turn, Aristeia, which manages $3 billion in investor money, has accused Sina of \u201cfailing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.\u201dForeign investors seem less than worried about any lack of control or lapses in corporate governance if the market is any indication. Shares in those companies have been on a tear in markets around the world as Chinese consumers reliably use their smartphones to buy electronics, shop for groceries, make investments, play games and look for dates.With more than 700 million users, China is the world\u2019s largest single internet market. Weibo has 313 million monthly average users.Still, some investors are quietly complaining about corporate governance practices.Chinese companies that list shares in the United States are not necessarily subject to American rules. Most are incorporated in light regulatory jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands.As a result, Chinese companies often behave differently. While Sina holds a regular annual meeting, some of its peers do not, a standard for the United States. Baidu, the search engine giant, has not held an annual shareholder meeting since 2008. JD.com, the online retailer, has never held one.\u201cInvestors have been getting a bit fed up with companies like Baidu and JD.com not having general meetings,\u201d said Jamie Allen, the secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association.A spokesman for JD.com said: \u201cInvestors appreciate our candor both on earnings calls and in engagement throughout the year. This issue has rarely, if ever, been raised to us.\u201d Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.Foreign investors also typically have fewer shareholder protections. To get around Chinese restrictions on outside investments in sensitive industries, many companies use a complicated legal structure, called a variable interest entity, or V.I.E. Under those arrangements, shareholders have rights to the profits of a company, but they do not control key assets \u2014 potentially leaving them exposed if the company runs into trouble or the Chinese government declares the structure illegal.Sina was a key player in the Chinese internet\u2019s emergence as a social and economic force. Its Weibo service, once derided by critics as a knockoff of Twitter, has grown in size and functionality to the point where it is now a must-read for many people.That separate listing helped set off the fight with Aristeia. Sina\u2019s shares have risen nearly 75 percent so far this year. But Weibo\u2019s performance has been better, with the stock more than doubling. Based on their stock market values, Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina \u2014 a gap that Aristeia says points to lackluster management and poor corporate governance.Sina uses a V.I.E. structure. Only one of the five director seats is available each year. The chairman and chief executive, Charles Chao, has a permanent position; the other members serve four-year terms.Aristeia is pushing for representation on the board so that directors will consider measures that would result in more money for shareholders. These include a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo or a buyback of shares by management.Sina says that any deal proposed by Aristeia would not clear because of China\u2019s complicated telecom and media rules. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, also owns a stake in Weibo, further complicating its options, Sina said.\u201cThe time, resources and capital invested to pursue a transaction with a high likelihood of failure, rather than accretive and value creating opportunities, is not in the best interests of Sina shareholders,\u201d Sina said in a statement.Some outsiders disagree. \u201cI think Sina has built in Weibo a very valuable asset that is not being reflected in its share price,\u201d said Randy Gelber, a managing director at UBS, the Swiss bank.\u201cIt would seem like there should be some common ground from both sides on how to realize that value,\u201d he said.Two proxy advisers \u2014 Glass Lewis & Company and International Shareholder Services \u2014 have given some weight to Aristeia\u2019s arguments. Glass Lewis recommended that Sina expand its board to allow Aristeia\u2019s nominees, and I.S.S. recommended that Sina shareholders support one of the two nominees.\u201cAn examination of the arguments reveals compelling reasons for shareholders to seek change at the company,\u201d I.S.S. said.It is also unfolding as the Chinese government looks to take a more active role in how its corporate giants are managed.Even if Aristeia emerges victorious, the real test could be whether its candidates will be able to push for change internally.\u201cThe question is whether that board member would be able to do anything other than jump up and down at meetings,\u201d said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Masayoshi Son\u2019s Grand Plan for SoftBank\u2019s $100 Billion Vision Fund", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Eric Gundersen, the chief executive of a mapping start-up called Mapbox, met Masayoshi Son, the head of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, in late July, he expected to have to sell Mr. Son on what made Mapbox important.\u201cFor Masa, his vision is not just about predictions like the Singularity, which has gotten a lot of hype,\u201d Mr. Gundersen said. \u201cHe understands that we\u2019ll need a massive amount of data to get us to a future that\u2019s more dependent on machines and robotics.\u201dYet the companies all have something in common: They are involved in collecting enormous amounts of data, which are crucial to creating the brains for the machines that, in the future, will do more of our jobs and creating tools that allow people to better coexist.If it ends up being completed, Mr. Son would own significant chunks of ride-hailing companies globally because SoftBank already owns stakes in Uber\u2019s rivals like Didi Chuxing in China and Ola in India. Altogether, SoftBank would have a network of companies that gather valuable logistics data and operate large, connected fleets that could work well with self-driving car technology.\u201cLocation data is central and mission critical to the development of the world\u2019s most exciting technologies,\u201d Rajeev Misra, who helps oversee SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, said about Mapbox in a statement on Tuesday. He added that the investment was part of SoftBank\u2019s plan to put money into \u201cthe foundational infrastructure for the next stage of the Information Revolution.\u201dSoftBank declined to comment further for this article.For more than three decades, Mr. Son has consistently made over SoftBank with acquisitions and investments to keep it on the cutting edge. The company began in 1981 as a PC software distributor in Japan and expanded to the United States in 1994 with the acquisition of the PC trade show operator Comdex.\u201cEvery industry that mankind ever defined and created, even agriculture, will be redefined,\u201d Mr. Son said. \u201cBecause the tools that we created were inferior to mankind\u2019s brain in the past. Now, the tools have become smarter than mankind ourselves.\u201dMr. Son is having many of the same conversations with entrepreneurs these days as he looks to spread investments from the Vision Fund. Many entrepreneurs said Mr. Son\u2019s conversations jumped from philosophical discussions about technology\u2019s impact on humanity to the minutiae of a technical problem.Mr. Son recently told Matt Barnard, the chief executive of Plenty, that computers were ushering in a revolution in agriculture not seen since the invention of the plow. Mr. Son led a $200 million investment in Plenty in July, part of an effort to make it a global leader in indoor farms. Plenty, which has no farms operating at scale, is now planning to open its first farm, in South San Francisco, by the end of the year.\u201cI really do like to believe he likes us a lot,\u201d Mr. Barnard said of Mr. Son. \u201cI\u2019d say the thing we have in common with his other investments is that they are all part of some of the largest systems on the planet: energy, transportation, the internet and food.\u201dSome entrepreneurs travel the globe to spend time with Mr. Son at his palatial home in Woodside, Calif., and his offices in India, San Francisco and Tokyo. The SoftBank chief is known for almost always smiling and speaking slowly. He rarely picks up phone calls, and his email signature includes the whirring fan icon that shows a computer is booting up, or \u201cthinking.\u201dMany of the entrepreneurs speak of Mr. Son with reverence.\u201cOnly people close to him know how huge his vision is,\u201d said Eugene Izhikevich, the chief executive of Brain Corp, a company based in San Diego that makes the software that controls autonomous robots.Mr. Son\u2019s engineers stumbled on Brain Corp when they were looking for self-driving car technology. Mr. Izhikevich was soon seated across from Mr. Son, talking about robotics as well as how Britain operated 200 years ago when the landed gentry did not work, but came up with new inventions and business improvements.Like many other entrepreneurs, Mr. Izhikevich said SoftBank moved \u201cscary fast\u201d to sew up its investment. Mr. Son\u2019s team swarmed Brain Corp\u2019s businesses and spent hundreds of hours on due diligence, wrapping up in a few months.Unlike other investors, Mr. Son, who is already talking about a second Vision Fund, does not insert himself into the day-to-day operations of most of the companies he has invested in. His Sprint deal has yet to pan out and may be dependent on merging with another company. When other investments have lagged, as did his investment in Snapdeal, an online retailer in India, he has invested in competitors, leading a $2.5 billion investment into Flipkart, a rival Indian e-commerce company.Some entrepreneurs said his breakneck investing pace with the Vision Fund was unlikely to slow.\u201cMasa is in a hurry,\u201d said Vijay Sharma, the chief executive of Indian digital payments start-up Paytm, which SoftBank put $1.4 billion into in May. \u201cHe sees this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where everything we touch can become a market, where we\u2019re at the opening up of a new industrial revolution.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Embrace of Private Investment Is Getting Tighter", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, wants to regain the private sector\u2019s confidence even as he squeezes it more tightly. Aligning private investment with state priorities could grease the bureaucratic skids for some companies, but more official meddling in boardrooms is unlikely to produce good business decisions. Opaque party politics will confuse outside investors and blur the line between some state and private companies.The private sector creates most of China\u2019s jobs, generates the bulk of its gross domestic product and is by far the most efficient user of labor and capital. China\u2019s economic growth miracle has occurred largely thanks to the ability of private companies to generate profit despite a shaky legal environment, entrenched official corruption and constant regulatory meddling.Yet despite the country\u2019s recent economic recovery, private investment is in a prolonged funk. It rose 6.4 percent for the year through August, in part because of a rebound in manufacturing and local government investment. That\u2019s better than the dismal performance of last year, but still well off the 15 percent-plus growth rates of recent years.The softness could in turn sap long-term growth: The International Monetary Fund reckons that private firms generate around seven to eight percentage points higher return on assets than their state-owned peers, but investment by the latter has far outpaced the former in the last two years.Officials recognize the risk. Despite the broader economic rally underway, private investment has never truly recovered from the downturn in late 2015. This year\u2019s revival depended in no small part on fiscal stimulus, a real estate rally and high commodity prices, all of which disproportionately benefit the state-owned enterprises that dominate China\u2019s heavy industry.If those areas come under pressure, private capital will be vital to maintain high growth. Thus the state is trying to reinspire entrepreneurs with rhetorical blandishments. On Sept. 25, officials unveiled guidance to foster \u201cthe entrepreneurial spirit\u201d; some think promoting the private sector might even feature as a theme at the 19th Communist Party Congress next week.The government has already put some money where its mouth is. The central bank said it would cut reserve requirements for banks in order to bolster credit to smaller companies, which some analysts estimate could add up to $150 billion of long-term liquidity. Premier Li Keqiang continues his drive to reduce fees, taxes and red tape that cut into profit margins. New areas of the economy have slowly and fitfully been opened to private investors. Partly as a result, China advanced to 78th place in the World Bank\u2019s \u201cease of doing business\u201d index this year, up from 93rd a decade ago.The trouble is, nearly everything else Mr. Xi is doing suggests a deep-rooted distrust of powerful private firms. Even as officials talk of getting state-owned companies to withdraw from nonstrategic industries \u2014 the state still dominates the beer and cigarette sectors \u2014 the government is inserting itself into businesses by other means.Officials have noticeably expanded their influence at large private firms, including multinationals, by inserting party committees into their governance structures. Executives sometimes feel compelled to participate in political projects, like the Xiong\u2019an New Area and the One Belt, One Road initiative.Bureaucrats have also rolled out \u201cguidance funds\u201d to buy stakes in priority industries and promote \u201cmixed ownership\u201d investments into state companies, occasionally using private capital. In certain cases that has more or less dragged technology giants like Alibaba into partnerships with state-owned firms like China Unicom.The next generation of outbound investors could look more like CEFC China Energy, a mysterious privately held firm with policy bank backing that is currently executing a $9.1 billion strategic investment in Russia\u2019s Rosneft.Investors should expect this divergence to continue into Mr. Xi\u2019s second term. On paper, firms will likely face somewhat less red tape, and doing business will become genuinely easier. Behind the scenes, however, the invisible hand of the party may extend its grip at the largest companies.Party politics, even at their most benign, are a distraction at best for senior management. But if officials continue to take a more active role in corporate decision-making, the famously efficient Chinese private sector could start looking a lot more like its wasteful state-owned counterpart.Advertisement"}
