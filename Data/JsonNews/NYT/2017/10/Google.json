{"Headline": "The Frightful Five Want to Rule Entertainment. They Are Hitting Limits.", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that\u2019s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline.Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing \u2014 in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches \u2014 are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit.This is the first of several columns in which I\u2019ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment \u2014 their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked.Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201dThe Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.There\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201dThis story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?It\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It\u2019s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up.Advertisement"}

Sam Brownback of Kansas, who promised that his big cut in tax rates would create jobs and explosive economic growth.The result was a large deficit and the necessity, three years later, to dramatically increase taxes to mitigate the damage, an action taken by his fellow Republicans, overriding his veto.ROBERT H.

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Pixel 2 Smartphone Is a Powerful Extravagance", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last smartphone I reviewed was the original Apple iPhone, which ushered in the mobile revolution back in 2007. At the time, I didn\u2019t exactly give the device a rave. Two weeks after waiting in line for hours outside the San Francisco Apple Store and paying $540 for the iPhone, I even returned it and got my money back.It was obvious to me that the iPhone was a powerful thing and everyone \u2014 from Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, right down to the people I passed on the street \u2014 kept telling me how great it was. But it was also an extravagance. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t really justify its $500-plus cost for another year.Ten years on, I\u2019m now reviewing the Pixel 2, the new flagship phone from Google that goes on sale Thursday. And my take is pretty much the same: People who want the latest and greatest phones won\u2019t be disappointed by the Pixel. But for most of us, this device, with a starting price of $649, is an extravagance.Google has found tremendous success convincing the world that it should prefer smartphones that run Android, its mobile operating system, which dominates global market share over Apple. But Google has had much less success designing and selling its own phones.Now comes the Pixel 2. After testing the gadget for nearly a week, I found I prefer it to the iPhone \u2014 though this is mostly because I have always carried Android phones. Android is what I\u2019m used to, and all my digital data is stored with Google, even though my daughters think I\u2019m silly for not buying an iPhone.Compared with other Android devices, the Pixel 2 XL, the model I tested and the larger of the two versions of the device, was also a big improvement. I own a Samsung Galaxy S7, widely considered the best Android phone on the market a year ago when it went on sale.(Incidentally, she meant it was not just better than my Samsung but also better than her iPhone. And that is not sacrilege. The detail and the colors are far sharper, even to an untrained eye like mine.)The Pixel also charged quickly; a few minutes plugged into the wall gets you hours of battery life. Google said the device is water-resistant. And the screen, 6.2 inches along the diagonal, was enormous \u2014 though not so huge that I couldn\u2019t comfortably hold the phone in one hand. It was nice that, for those rare occasions when I watched extended YouTube videos, the image stretched to the edge of the phone.Yet is any of this all that different from other top-of-the-line phones? Not really. And Google knows this. Even the steep $849 pricing for the Pixel 2 XL was in line with rivals.\u201cIt sounds more normal,\u201d my 13-year-old said. Still, she added that the improvement was small.That sums up all these services. Many are technically impressive, and some are useful. But they took the Pixel only so far past the status quo.Google Lens gave my 9-year-old several minutes of fun over the weekend. But it\u2019s not something she \u2014 or I \u2014 would use on a regular basis. (And it mistook a picture in my bedroom of New York\u2019s Flatiron Building for the Empire State Building.)The Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. My younger daughter loved it. (At one point, she said it was more fun than me.)But like those other assistants, it could not deal with more than just a handful of simple tasks, typically delivering web pages or preset answers in response to questions. When I asked the Assistant whether $824 was expensive for a smartphone, it gave me a YouTube video of a guy unboxing some sort of $20,000 monstrosity.Google boasts that you can instantly switch the Assistant into a mode that lets you type questions rather than ask them orally. But as my wife said, these assistants are useful only because they let you handle basic tasks \u2014 like sending a text or setting an alarm \u2014 without typing. If I wanted to type, I would just visit google.com.Still, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL. On the way to dinner on Saturday night, it correctly identified every song that played on the local 1980s station, from \u201cThe Warrior\u201d to \u201cDer Kommissar.\u201dEven so, I plan to keep the $849 for now. The smaller version of the new Pixel goes for $649, and I might go for that, when I finally need a new phone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Many on Puerto Rico, the Most Coveted Item is a Plane Ticket Out", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 On a hurricane-battered island where people may still wait hours for gasoline, cash and ice, one of the scarcest, most precious commodities has become a plane ticket out.Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, thousands of Puerto Ricans are cramming onto the small number of scheduled flights and charter jets and are fleeing for the mainland United States, rather than endure months more without power, cellphone service or regular running water.\u201cNothing is beautiful anymore,\u201d said Glenda Gomez, 31, who is planning to leave for Miami on Friday with her three children.So people are selling their cars, abandoning wrecked houses and leaving their property in the hands of relatives who are staying behind. Some expect to return after a few months on the mainland; others say they are going for good.Puerto Rican airports have become scenes of tearful goodbyes as families send their children, spouses and parents to live with relatives in Orlando, New York, Washington \u2014 wherever.On the mainland, cities and states with large Puerto Rican populations are preparing for the influx by trying to help people find housing, work and schools. Florida alone \u2014 already home to 1 million Puerto Ricans \u2014 anticipates as many as 100,000 arrivals to the Orlando and the -Tampa Bay area.In the two weeks since the storm gutted Ms. Gomez\u2019s home on the eastern coast of Puerto Rico and ruined her dreams of renting rooms to tourists, Ms. Gomez said, her family has been surviving on canned food and boxed milk, paid for with the only cash they had on hand \u2014 her three children\u2019s private-school fees. Her husband has been waiting in line for hours to buy fuel for their generator. She has been making two-hour trips to buy groceries from a swampy supermarket. Finally, she decided: Enough.Relatives in Miami offered to buy plane tickets for her and the children, and Ms. Gomez made plans to use the last few gallons of gasoline in her car \u2014 it was just enough for the drive to the San Juan International Airport.Now, the exodus of families like the Gomezes is accelerating a decade-long slump in population that has seen Puerto Rico lose about 400,000 people during a period of economic strain. Experts say the new wave of migration raises concerns about who will be left to rebuild the island\u2019s shattered infrastructure, and how an economy suffocated by $73 billion in debt and 10 percent unemployment will rebound if tens of thousands more residents suddenly leave.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a stampede,\u201d said Jorge Duany, a professor at Florida International University who studies migration to and from the island \u2014 and has left the island himself. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go back and retire. But now it looks like it\u2019s going to take a little longer.\u201dMr. Duany said it was too early to say how many were migrating on the packed planes leaving San Juan, or how many might boomerang back if Puerto Rico heals and life eases back to normal sooner than expected.Working-age adults made up the bulk of migrants over the past decade, Mr. Duany said, but this storm has prompted many families to put older relatives and children onto planes, to ensure that they get necessary medical care or to salvage something of the school year.In interviews across the island and in packed airport departures halls, people said they were already registering their children for school in Orlando, Charlotte or New York. They are starting to line up jobs and apartments with relatives across the country.Nancy Santos, 58, who was waiting in an ice line in Ponce last week, said she plans to leave as soon as possible with her daughter and three grandchildren. They will join family in Connecticut at least until Christmas, while they wait for conditions to normalize in Puerto Rico. Once things settle down, she plans to return to Ponce to sell her cars and furniture and then leave for good.\u201cEveryone will leave \u2014 everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThings are so bad here. Look at us, making lines in the middle of the night for two bags of ice that are half water.\u201d She added: \u201cI have to do it for the kids. I am not going to think about it twice.\u201dNayda D\u00e1vila, a 69-year-old retired judicial worker, said she could not stop crying as she packed her only piece of luggage by candlelight earlier this week. Her daughter in Washington, D.C., bought her a one-way ticket to get out of her rural hometown of Salinas.\u201cIt\u2019s the heat, the sun,\u201d Ms. D\u00e1vila said. \u201cThere\u2019s no water, no food, and six to eight hours for gas.\u201d\u201cAt my age, how much longer do I have left?\u201d Ms. D\u00e1vila said. \u201cAnd this island won\u2019t recover for much, much longer.\u201dMs. D\u00e1vila was one of the 10 passengers waiting on Wednesday to board a humanitarian flight on a private jet departing from Isla Grande Airport, a small airfield next to the convention center in San Juan where hurricane relief efforts are headquartered.\u201cI\u2019m a strong woman,\u201d Ms. D\u00e1vila said, holding back tears as she stared at the runway. \u201cBut Maria defeated me.\u201dMany of the dozen waiting passengers were older or had medical conditions for which treatment was impeded by the storm.Juan Delgado Torres, 75, was still recovering from a knee operation he had two months ago. Since Maria lashed the island, he hasn\u2019t been able to get the medication he needs or a doctor to prescribe it. To get him stable care, his daughter in Philadelphia organized a way out of the island and offered him her home.\u201cI\u2019m going one way, until things get better,\u201d said Mr. Delgado, a retired office clerk. \u201cIt\u2019s painful, I don\u2019t want to do it, but I have to.\u201dThe decision can be just as painful for the young.Hurricane Maria\u2019s winds blew away parts of Hacienda Don Jos\u00e9, a popular tourist restaurant in Condado, and took Jos\u00e9 Manuel Ure\u00f1a\u2019s job as a cook with it. Left without a source of income, Mr. Ure\u00f1a decided it was time to leave.\u201cI want a change,\u201d said Mr. Ure\u00f1a, sitting on the curb at Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n Avenue in Santurce, where residents gather at a popular Wifi spot, many to arrange a way out of the island. \u201cI haven\u2019t accomplished anything here,\u201d he said.On October 19, Mr. Ure\u00f1a, 24, plans to board a flight to Newark where a friend, who is also leaving Puerto Rico, found him a job as a cook at a Thai restaurant. Mr. Ure\u00f1a says he only knows \u201cbasic English,\u201d but he\u2019s migrating \u201cwith an open mind.\u201d\u201cI feel nervous and scared,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the day looms closer, the worse I feel.\u201dIn Florida, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on Monday for all 67 counties in the state, making it easier for the counties to house, educate and help Puerto Ricans by waiving regulations. The declaration could also attract more federal money to the state.For more immediate help, the governor announced that Florida will set up three one-stop relief shopping centers inside airport terminals and the Port of Miami, where Puerto Ricans can seek assistance with jobs, education, housing and programs like Medicaid and food stamps.But some families like the Ortizes have no idea exactly what awaits them when they step off the plane. Raymond Ortiz plans to put his teenage son and daughter on a plane on Sunday, to travel to his sister\u2019s home in Rocky Mount, N.C. He and his wife will follow later. Mr. Ortiz, 50, was born in New York, but he has lived in Puerto Rico for 16 years, and his wife and children were born here.He said he will probably do maintenance work, and his wife \u2014 an office assistant at a health agency \u2014 has a lead on a job at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. He said his wife is especially anxious because she speaks halting English and has lived only in Puerto Rico.But the family looked at a satellite view of their new hometown on Google Maps, and Mr. Ortiz said he loved all the green he saw. The high school that his 16-year-old son will attend has two baseball diamonds \u2014 a dream for a player whose team has not had a practice or game since before the hurricane.Mr. Ortiz had wanted to return to the mainland even before Maria, because he was fed up with the island\u2019s schools, hospital system, politics and crime. The lingering mess created by the hurricane was the last straw for him. Still, he said he felt a twinge about leaving.\u201cI feel really at home here \u2014 more than those 35 years I lived in New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to a place I\u2019ve never been. I don\u2019t know nobody. I don\u2019t know the neighborhood.

{"Headline": "Tech Executives Are Contrite About Election Meddling, but Make Few Promises on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter appeared on Capitol Hill for the first time on Tuesday to publicly acknowledge their role in Russia\u2019s influence on the presidential campaign, but offered little more than promises to do better. Their reluctance frustrated lawmakers who sought stronger evidence that American elections will be protected from foreign powers.The hearing, the first of three in two days for company executives, served as an initial public reckoning for the internet giants. They had emphasized their role as public squares for political discourse but are being forced to confront how they were used as tools for a broad Russian misinformation campaign.Both Democrats and some Republicans on a Senate Judiciary subcommittee complained that the companies had waited nearly a year to publicly admit how many Americans were exposed to the Russian effort to spread propaganda during the 2016 campaign. Senators pushed for harsher remedies, including regulations on their advertising practices akin to rules for political advertising on television.\u201cWhy has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is and begin to work in a responsible legislative way to address it?\u201d asked Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware.Since then, the company has scrambled to appease lawmakers by promising to hire more than 1,000 people to manually review political ad purchases and to make public the funding behind those ads.\u201cThe foreign interference we saw was reprehensible,\u201d Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, told senators.The companies also acknowledged that they were struggling to keep up with the threat of foreign interference.\u201cThe abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us \u2014 and one that we are determined to meet,\u201d said Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett.At the heart of the companies\u2019 problems are business models that reward viral content \u2014 which can include misinformation \u2014 and an enormous advertising business that is automated and unable to easily spot ads purchased by foreign governments.In a sign of the shifting political winds for tech giants, Republicans, who have been more restrained in their criticism of the companies, were more skeptical on Tuesday. In one contentious exchange, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed Mr. Stretch on whether Facebook could possibly police all of its advertisers.\u201cI\u2019m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don\u2019t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?\u201dMr. Stretch acknowledged that Facebook could not track all those advertisers.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the chairman of the crime and terrorism subcommittee that held the hearing, said the risk went beyond Russia to other American adversaries. Talking to reporters afterward, he alluded to potential regulation of political advertising online.\u201cIt\u2019s Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cWhat we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.\u201dFacebook, Twitter and Google have not publicly opposed a bipartisan proposal to require reports on who funds political ads online, similar to rules for broadcast television. In private, their lobbyists have praised voluntary efforts to disclose political ad funding and have resisted many aspects of the bill.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the legislation was essential before the midterm elections in 2018.\u201cOur midterms are 370 days away, and we don\u2019t have time to mess around with dialogue anymore,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview after the hearing. Ms. Klobuchar introduced the bill with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.During the hearing, some Republicans also sought to play down the Russian effort to tip the election in favor of President Trump, stressing incorrectly that the Kremlin\u2019s agents did not favor a particular presidential candidate in last year\u2019s election.\u201cRussia does not have loyalty to a political party in the United States,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cTheir goal is to divide us and discredit our democracy.\u201dMr. Graham asked Mr. Stretch of Facebook to confirm that the pattern of activity the site saw from Russia was more focused on sowing chaos in the United States than in bolstering Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201cDuring the election, they were trying to create discord between Americans, most of it directed against Clinton,\u201d Mr. Graham said, addressing Mr. Stretch. \u201cAfter the election, you saw Russian-tied groups and organizations trying to undermine President Trump\u2019s legitimacy. Is that what you saw on Facebook?\u201dMr. Stretch agreed. But the question was narrowly tailored, apparently intended to distance the broader Russian interference from the backing of Mr. Trump.Though the companies promised to work with government officials, Mr. Stretch stopped short of agreeing to some suggestions.In one heated exchange, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him to reject political ad purchases in foreign currencies.\u201cHow did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?\u201d Mr. Franken said.But Mr. Stretch hemmed, saying the rejection of a foreign currency to buy political ads would not solve the problem of foreign interference.\u201cThe reason I\u2019m hesitating on foreign currency is it\u2019s relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies,\u201d Mr. Stretch said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a signal, but not enough.\u201dThat response failed to satisfy Mr. Franken, who interrupted with exasperation.\u201cMy goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better,\u201d Mr. Franken said, raising his voice.This week, the companies admitted that the abuse of their platforms was much greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to Facebook\u2019s admission, Google said that agents who were also from the Internet Research Agency uploaded more than 1,000 videos on its YouTube platform. Twitter said the agency published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter.On Wednesday, the top lawyers for all three companies will appear before the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are conducting their own investigations into the Russian election meddling.Tuesday\u2019s hearing exposed a much deeper struggle for Facebook, which is trying to tread a delicate line as a technology platform while also fighting against hate speech, violence and misinformation on its site.\u201cI like that they are contrite, but these issues are existential and they aren\u2019t taking any structural changes,\u201d said Tim Wu, a professor of law at Columbia University. \u201cThese are Band-Aids.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frances McDormand\u2019s Difficult Women", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "FeatureThe actor has built a career, and a passionate fan base, playing supporting roles; now, at 60, she has become an unconventional star.Supported by\u201cWhich way is the river?\u201d she asked, scanning the narrow boulevards snaking in every direction.I pointed left, and she took off so swiftly that I had to run to catch up. When I did, she was cursing under her breath at her faulty inner compass. She has lived most of her life in Manhattan. She likes grids.The route she was practicing began at the Centre Pompidou, where she was performing with the experimental theater company the Wooster Group, of which she has been a member for nearly two decades. It ended at a friend\u2019s apartment off the Boulevard St.-Germain. The rest of the company was lodged in the Marais, and McDormand had been concerned about the state of their accommodations. She likes to be sure that her co-stars are comfortably situated and has been known to inspect and then personally redecorate cast quarters in advance of their arrival. On one of the Wooster Group\u2019s previous Paris tours, the hotel was less than clean, and though no one could call McDormand high maintenance, she has no patience with squalor. \u201cWe\u2019re avant-garde. It doesn\u2019t mean we have to be unhygienic.\u201dShe would be walking home alone after shows, and she doesn\u2019t use Google Maps. Her cellphone still has buttons and a hinge.\u201cDo you want me to look this up?\u201d I asked, reaching for my smartphone, and she responded as if I\u2019d reached for the grenade pin. \u201cNO! DON\u2019T!\u201d She shook her head firmly. \u201cThen we\u2019ll never learn.\u201d She caught a glimpse of the Seine and was gone again.Frances McDormand, or Fran, as she is called in regular life, cuts a handsome figure on the street. She is 60 and sexy in the manner of women who have achieved total self-possession. She eschews makeup unless she is working, doesn\u2019t dye her hair and despises the nips, tucks and lifts that have become routine for women of her profession. Her clothes are well made \u2014 she loves clothes \u2014 but utilitarian and comfortable. On this day she was wearing loose-legged cropped pants, black-and-peach sneakers, a navy sweater and a thin headband shoved in and out of uncombed hair as the mood struck.She doesn\u2019t do press junkets, and for most of the 20 years since she won a Best Actress Academy Award for playing Marge Gunderson, the tremendously pregnant, improbably cheerful police detective in \u201cFargo,\u201d she has refused interviews. Her publicist explained to me that his job is to politely tell people to go away.She paused in the street. \u201cI say: \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019\u2009\u201d She peered into my eyes and grasped my arm. \u201cI touch them. I look at them. I have a real exchange,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not an actor because I want my picture taken. I\u2019m an actor because I want to be part of the human exchange.\u201dMcDormand turned back to me triumphant. \u201cSee? The exchange.\u201dHer first film role was Abby in the Coen brothers\u2019 noirish debut, \u201cBlood Simple.\u201d (This was kismet; the Coen brothers, then unknown, went on to create some of McDormand\u2019s best roles, and she and Joel Coen married.) Abby is a proper ing\u00e9nue, a young Texan woman with wide eyes and fluffy curls and a habit of softly telling men she loves them when she is afraid they might hurt her. In \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d McDormand is in her mid-20s, dewy and golden blond, and she seems to occupy brighter, warmer light than anyone else in her scenes. She is addictive to watch, which obscures the fact that, as she pointed out to me, Abby is fairly two-dimensional. \u201cThe one thing that I\u2019ve always been able to offer them is a complexity that fills out an idea they have of something,\u201d she said of the Coen brothers in an interview for the Criterion Collection\u2019s release of \u201cBlood Simple\u201d in 2016.This ability to suggest a fascinating inner life just out of the viewer\u2019s reach made McDormand\u2019s career as a character actress. She takes marginal characters and makes them the most robust people in the movie. So it was with the fierce, Goethe-quoting widow in \u201cAlmost Famous,\u201d who gets a scant few scenes but earned McDormand an Oscar nomination; the hapless gym employee who wants a butt lift in \u201cBurn After Reading\u201d; the molelike film editor in \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201dMcDormand explained to me that had she stayed in the theater, she would have played all the canonical leading women, but in Hollywood her looks disqualified her. \u201cI was too old, too young, too fat, too thin, too tall, too short, too blond, too dark \u2014 but at some point they\u2019re going to need the other,\u201d she told me. \u201cSo I\u2019d get really good at being the other.\u201d Years of hearing this type of thing from casting directors have provoked in her a defiant renunciation of vanity and a deep, though intermittent, self-consciousness. She\u2019ll state her weight in a public interview but avoids looking at the monitor when filming. \u201cI\u2019d much rather not be aware of how fat my ass looks,\u201d she said. She wants the work that is given to stars, but she hates to have her photo taken. She doesn\u2019t own a full-length mirror.In the last 10 years, something shifted for McDormand: Right as she hit the age when most actresses begin disappearing for lack of roles or moving to the edges of story lines, she moved to first billing. For decades, she excelled at the work of embroidering the lives of women who aren\u2019t deemed appealing enough to watch for two hours straight, and rather than aging into a different acting type, she has taken it upon herself to put peripheral women at the center.In 2009, she optioned Elizabeth Strout\u2019s novel \u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d shortly before it won the Pulitzer Prize. She and a friend, the screenwriter Jane Anderson, embarked on a long adaptation for HBO. \u201cShe later admitted to me that it made her nervous; she didn\u2019t know if she could carry a film,\u201d Anderson told me. McDormand kept asking to take Olive out of scenes, to make her a supporting part. \u201cI said, \u2018Fran, it\u2019s called \u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d! She can\u2019t be a side character.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d is a four-hour peregrination inside one woman\u2019s life \u2014 a postmenopausal woman who\u2019s not the Queen of England or an aging rock star or a mother suffering picturesquely from dementia, but a starchy middle-school math teacher living in Down East Maine. Olive is furious and uncompromising, agitated by her husband, who is \u201coppressively nice\u201d (McDormand\u2019s words), puzzled and disappointed by her son, ill at ease with emotion and bewildered by social niceties. She burps uncontrollably and spares no one the truth. She\u2019s moral, she cares, but still she\u2019s unable to be what the people closest to her need: warm, compromising, wifely, motherly.The project was the first work McDormand ever produced for herself, after a long career in which her only power, as she describes the actor\u2019s lot, was the power to say no. It was also her first concentrated effort to create a female story that felt as complex as real women\u2019s lives. \u201cI became interested in educating people in the variety of ways in which women can express their emotion. Which is much easier to do in a large role than in a supporting role to a male protagonist. In general, the women in a supporting role to a male protagonist \u2014 cry a lot.\u201d McDormand insisted on Olive\u2019s right not to cry and battled the director, Lisa Cholodenko, over whether Olive should break down at several key moments in the series. The women were already comfortable working together. Cholodenko, who directed McDormand in \u201cLaurel Canyon\u201d (2002), prevailed, pleading that the audience needed an opportunity to feel affection for the character. (McDormand privately made a list for me of which moments of crying were authentically Olive, and which were her doing what she was told.) The balance they struck worked: \u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d won eight Emmys in 2015, including the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie award for McDormand.This fall, she will be the star of a film featuring another caustic antiheroine, who was written just for her: Mildred in Martin McDonagh\u2019s \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d McDormand plays a mother whose daughter has been raped and murdered, and who has made it her mission to terrorize the local Police Department until they give the case the attention it deserves.Mildred is a difficult character \u2014 she\u2019s violent, sometimes in baffling ways. She\u2019s foulmouthed and enraged, pitiless and a bit demented. She stomps around town in a car mechanic\u2019s jumpsuit with the back of her head shaved, ready to scorch the earth. McDormand is imposing in the role mostly because of her stillness. Her back is ramrod straight inside her jumpsuit. She doesn\u2019t walk; she strides. \u201cI really played it like a man,\u201d she said. \u201cI completely based the character upon John Wayne and John Ford movies, because that\u2019s a two-hour arc. Those characters can come out of nowhere, they don\u2019t need a lot of background, you don\u2019t have to explain why they\u2019re like that, they just are the way they are.\u201dMcDonagh thought of Mildred more as a Marlon Brando character. \u201cWe both liked her,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe both loved her, but didn\u2019t want to do anything to make her more likable or lovable. For once, we don\u2019t have to show the female side or the light side or the nurturing, mothering side. We both said, \u2018[expletive] that, we\u2019re doing something different this time.\u2019\u2009\u201d Whether or not you buy the notion that rage and violence are incompatible with \u201ca female side,\u201d whether you like the notion that the actor\u2019s way into Mildred was to \u201cplay it like a man,\u201d there\u2019s something surprising about seeing a female protagonist like Mildred. Nothing is done to make her grief soft or even to imply that she was a very good mother in the first place. She isn\u2019t made for viewing pleasure or to teach a lesson; she\u2019s just there, hurling Molotov cocktails at the world.\u201cEarly Shaker Spirituals\u201d is McDormand\u2019s favorite of the productions she has done with the group. In it, five of the group\u2019s female members (LeCompte, McDormand, Cynthia Hedstrom, Bebe Miller and Suzzy Roche) recreate a field recording of Shaker spirituals made in 1976 at one of the last remaining Shaker colonies, in Maine. \u201cThese women are not trying to sing pretty,\u201d McDormand said. \u201cKate always has to remind me not to make it pleasant. You fail if you try to make a pleasant sound.\u201dIn rehearsal, as in life, her body is kinetic and restless. The company was brushing up the performance after a long break, and whenever someone made an error, McDormand\u2019s mouth twisted or her eyes betrayed intense perception and restrained irritation. Throughout rehearsal, she was rapt but funny, keeping one ear tuned toward Valk\u2019s mood at all times while finding moments to touch or joke with the cast and crew. She was the goody-two-shoes and the class clown wrapped up in one.\u201cWhat\u2019s perfect about the union of the Wooster Group and the Shakers is that both are matriarchal, both are about discipline and rigor and work,\u201d McDormand explained to me over drinks with Valk and LeCompte. LeCompte had a glass of Sancerre, McDormand had a glass of viognier and Valk had a smoothie. \u201cIts foundation is postmenopausal women. The five of us, Liz being the oldest and in a position of power, and Kate directing us \u2014 so it\u2019s six postmenopausal women. And what you gain after menopause is the power of invisibility. You become sexually invisible to both men and women. You gain the power of not giving a [expletive].\u201d\u201cAnd we love the music,\u201d Valk added.McDormand nodded, looking pensive. \u201cAnd I love the bonnet.\u201dA preposterously muscled young man walked by, and McDormand followed him with her eyes. \u201cThat physiognomy is part of what\u2019s happening with gender equality right now. Men are trying to indicate that they are still marketable procreators \u2014 it\u2019s like plumage.\u201dValk agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s like that great documentary on the American wood duck. And all the things that male wood ducks do.\u201dThe conversation shifted to my presence. LeCompte and Valk were curious about what McDormand had gotten herself into. \u201cAre they going to take photographs of you?\u201d Valk wanted to know. She turned to me. \u201cIs she going to be a cover girl?\u201dMcDormand made a face. \u201cNo. No. They never \u2014\u201d She stopped. \u201cI\u2019m not a cover-type person.\u201d Before anyone could protest, she changed the subject: She thought perhaps a bird had pooped in her wine.She signaled the waiter and caught my eye. \u201cDo you think you can tell him that a bird pooped in my wine and I\u2019d like a little extra?\u201d The waiter arrived.Shortly after returning from Paris, I received an email from her with the subject line \u201cMy head shot.\u201d It contained a photograph of her floating naked in a lake. She doesn\u2019t like having her picture taken, she wrote, but this might suit the magazine\u2019s purposes. Two months after that, she sent me a picture of herself at the dinner table with a head of cauliflower perched atop her like a crown.In reply to the lake picture, I sent her the poet Mary Ruefle\u2019s essay \u201cPause.\u201d Hot flashes are the least of menopause, Ruefle tells the young woman she imagines might be reading. You will want to drive a knife through your heart; you will want to leave your lover, no matter how much you have loved them. You will feel as though your life is over, because it is. You will realize for the first time that your whole life people have looked at you because you are a woman and people look at women \u2014 but now, suddenly, you are invisible. But then something magical happens:\u201cShe got it perfectly,\u201d McDormand wrote back a few hours later. \u201cAround 46 years of age, I became concerned that I may slaughter my family. I was perimenopausal when Pedro\u201d \u2014 her son \u2014 \u201cwas in the throes of adolescence and at the mercy of testosterone poisoning. I continue to have three hot flashes daily, one bout of cold sweats per night, and have reveled in my invisibility for 10 years. So there.\u201dMcDormand was the last and, she thinks, ninth child to be taken in by Noreen and Vernon McDormand. Vernon was a pastor with the Disciples of Christ who had a talent for starting new outposts of the church. He and Noreen moved between working-class communities in the South and the Midwest every few years, and because Noreen was never able to carry a pregnancy to term, the couple fostered children wherever they went. They adopted two, a son and a daughter, through the foster system. In the late \u201950s, they adopted their third, a 1-year-old named Cynthia, who, as far as anyone knows, was born to a young woman in Vernon\u2019s parish. They changed her name to Frances.In her late teens, McDormand was offered the chance to meet her birth mother, and she refused. The anger she felt at being unwanted had become too important a part of her psychology, she thought. Still, she sounds proud when she calls herself \u201cwhite trash\u201d like her birth mother, and she has spent much of her career playing women who, in one way or another, resemble that description.She describes her upbringing with the McDormands as \u201ckind of Norman Rockwell-y\u201d: hymn singing, spaghetti dinners, summer Bible camps run by her father. Though Noreen often worked full time as a receptionist and had lots of kids to take care of, she strived to make a homemade dessert every night, often elaborate cakes, like a three-tiered Lady Baltimore. McDormand\u2019s favorite was more d\u00e9class\u00e9: angel food cake with orange-juice icing. The family moved mostly between small agricultural communities like Hillsboro, Ky., Statesboro, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn., where they lived in a neighborhood that was built over the town dump. McDormand, then in second grade, found that this provided excellent treasure hunting.Their longest stay was in Monessen, Pa., a steel town near Pittsburgh, where, she told the public-radio benefactors, the mill \u201cglowed and thrummed, day and night.\u201d The working-class women she plays are familiar to her from childhood. \u201cThose are the people that held me and raised me, and the work ethic I have,\u201d she says. That\u2019s why she shows up herself for lighting and camera set up, though it is expected that hired stand-ins endure the technical rehearsals. McDormand does her hair and makeup too, if it\u2019s efficient. \u201cI\u2019m a member of the company, I\u2019m not outside of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI like being right in the middle of everything. It\u2019s isolating and vulnerable.\u201dIt was at Monessen High School that she acted for the first time, as Lady Macbeth. She was 14, and an English teacher had the students put on scenes from Shakespeare after school. \u201cI spent a lot of time alone reading books, and this was the first time that literature took me into a public place where I could share it with other people,\u201d she told me. She started acting in school plays, never as the lead but as the colorful characters, the ones who came out screaming or fainting. She went to Bethany College in West Virginia, because it was affiliated with the Disciples of Christ and she could get a scholarship. There, she became the only theater major in her class, drove vans across the border into Pennsylvania so her classmates could buy birth control and steadily worked her way through her post-hometown to-do list: sex, drugs, profanity.At 24, newly graduated from Yale\u2019s M.F.A. program in acting, she was offered a role in \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d which marked the beginning of her professional career as well as of her 33-year partnership with Joel Coen. From the start, they met each other\u2019s instincts with unquestioning courtesy. \u201cIt was a revelation that I could have a lover who I could also work with and I wasn\u2019t intimidated by the person,\u201d McDormand told me. In past relationships, she struggled against feeling subservient, trapped in fraught sexual power dynamics. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t happen with Joel. It was: Wow! Really! Oh, my God! I can actually love and live \u2014 not subvert anything, not apologize for anything, not hide anything.\u201dThe McCoens, as McDormand sometimes refers to her marriage unit, now maintain two residences: an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where they\u2019ve lived for decades, and a 1,300-square-foot house in what McDormand would prefer me to call An Unnamed Town in the Pacific Northwest. This is where McDormand spends most of her time, and she forbade me to specify even a state, not so much because she worries people will track her down but because she feels protective of her Unnamed Town. She is involved in local efforts to protect affordable housing, and with the local radio station. The cheesemonger runs around the counter to give her a hug when she comes in.The day before I flew there to visit her, McDormand decided, after some deliberation, that I was not invited to her house. \u201cIt is mine,\u201d she emailed me, \u201cand I also don\u2019t like articles where actors reveal their private lives.\u201d This was part of a longer missive about her complex relationship to anger, and the pain of being adopted, so I pushed back. She was unmoved. Her reply was a link to the online portfolio of the architect who helped them with their last renovation and a dare: \u201cGuess which is ours.\u201d\u201cLook at this,\u201d she said, handing me an apple. It was a variety called a Pink Pearl, which a neighbor had brought her. Its skin was a pale, nearly translucent yellow. She fished out her pocketknife and cut into it, revealing brilliant pink and white swirls. \u201cHave you ever seen anything like that?\u201dI told her I thought I knew the answer to the question I was about to ask, but: Why these roles? Why these women?\u201cWhat kind of women?\u201d\u201cOh, profane women. Or rageful, or violent.\u201d\u201cI mean, I know I\u2019m profane. And outspoken. But I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re fun!\u201d She chewed and thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that they\u2019re angry. It\u2019s more \u2014\u201d She paused. \u201cMy politics are private, but many of my feminist politics cross over into my professional life. Because I portray female characters, so I have the opportunity to change the way people look at them. Even if I wasn\u2019t consciously doing that, it would happen anyway, just because of how I present as a woman, or as a person. I present in a way that\u2019s not stereotypical, even if I\u2019m playing a stereotypical role.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t subtract that from myself anymore. I could when I was younger.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs that just what happens with age?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding seriously, and took a bite of Pink Pearl. \u201cThat\u2019s another great thing about getting older. Your life is written on your face.\u201dShe eventually agreed to be photographed but asked that the session be as unlike a typical shoot as possible: no hair person, no makeup artist, no wardrobe. Initially, when asked to talk about the \u201cconcept,\u201d she had suggested a \u201cno-concept concept.\u201d Later, she allowed that she might wear some plants in her hair. It would be interesting to appear like the spirit of a Shaker woman floating around Lower Manhattan.On the appointed morning in August, she blew like a friendly hurricane into the photo studio in TriBeCa one minute early. She surveyed the variety of flower crowns laid out on the props table, picked up a wreath of cotton branches and set it on her head. \u201cHow cool is THIS,\u201d she shouted, looking in the mirror. \u201cBut it\u2019s not at all me.\u201d The faux peonies, daisies, sea grasses and laurel went the way of the cotton. She took the young stylist who had made the wreaths cozily by his arm and thanked him for his work. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. But they\u2019re not right for me. It looks great on you, though! You should wear it.\u201d She set the daisies on his head and announced the return of the no-concept concept. \u201cJust me. Just me as myself.\u201dMcDormand-as-herself was dressed in wide-leg bluejeans, a tank top with no bra, a long-sleeve T-shirt, Birkenstock sandals and a giant denim jacket. Out of her backpack she produced two other options: a bandanna and a long white nightgown. \u201cI wore it last night, but I ironed it,\u201d she said.Even with as few people on set as possible and without all the accouterments of a cover shoot, McDormand seemed to be gritting her teeth. She shifted under the lights in her tank top and bare feet like a child. Someone turned on the music she\u2019d requested (\u201cSmooth,\u201d by Santana), and she swayed a little, uncertainly. She caught my eye across the room and made a small motion, asking me to dance too, where I was standing, so she wouldn\u2019t be all alone up there. We bopped awkwardly to Santana while she tried to ignore the camera.There is a stunning un-self-consciousness that overtakes her characters when they are alone. In these moments on film, you can see the face fall open and reveal a whole person, whoever she is when she\u2019s turned inward, unwatched. Her ability to go to this place in front of a camera is one of her singular talents. I had been curious whether that might happen this morning, a sort of reverse-engineered revelation as Fran performed Fran. But if that moment came, it was distinguishable only to the camera, and perhaps to the photographer. As the hours passed, McDormand kept the room in a state of mild panic. She stood there at one point in her nightgown with a sweater on her head. She sent the wreath stylist to cut pieces of boxwood she had noticed on the building\u2019s roof terrace, and then winked at me as he went. She turned around so the back of her head faced the camera and announced that she wanted to try a few like this. \u201cThis is my angle,\u201d she said.\u201cI never do this,\u201d she kept saying to the photo team. All morning: \u201cI never, ever do this.\u201d\u201cThen why are you doing it?\u201d someone finally asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d She said. She seemed to really consider the question. \u201cI guess I want more work.\u201dAt the end of the day, the group went outside for some exterior shots in the alley behind the studio, and McDormand spotted three teenage boys hanging out on the sidewalk.She called to them: Would they come sit and chat while she was photographed? \u201cIt\u2019s for a magazine,\u201d she explained. At first, the boys were hesitant. \u201cDon\u2019t want to get famous too soon,\u201d one of them said with a little smile.\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, and she reached out her hand. \u201cI have to have my photo taken. Just come and sit with me so I don\u2019t have to be in the picture alone.\u201d They relented and perched next to her for a few minutes while she asked them about their clothes, their school, what their names were, what they liked to do. It had begun to rain lightly, but McDormand was happy, scooched in, well lit but mostly obscured by the three lanky bodies. She chatted keenly with her co-stars, a member of the company, as if none of the rest of us were there.Jordan Kisner is a writer from California now based in New York, where she teaches creative writing at Columbia University.

Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \u201ccognitive diversity\u201d is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of \u2014 individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won\u2019t do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies. Whether companies do it intentionally or not, I worry that they will adjust the definition of diversity so that, conveniently, it\u2019s already achieved.Ms. Smith said in the email clarifying her remarks, \u201cOur commitment at Apple to increasing racial and gender diversity is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d That kind of diversity \u2014 the old-fashioned kind, that still remains elusive \u2014 is what I hope my industry won\u2019t abandon.B\u00e4r\u00ed A.

{"Headline": "Making the Lives of Cybercriminals and Spies Harder Online", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity reporter based in Boulder, Colo., discussed the tech she is using.As a cybersecurity reporter, what do you do to secure your technology setup?I went through a period about three years ago of trying to have perfect \u201cop sec\u201d for everything. I used a password manager. I had a spare computer for web browsing beyond email, banking and social media. I used Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, encryption for any emails with sources. And I refused to buy any \u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices, like a Nest thermostat, fearing that all those devices did was give hackers entry into my home.But over the past year or so, I have to admit, I\u2019ve backtracked. I\u2019ve covered a few too many breaches of password managers and of security companies, and sophisticated nation-state attacks, to believe that there is such thing as \u201cop sec.\u201dSo now my goal is to try to make the lives of cybercriminals and spies harder online, and take my most sensitive communications completely offline \u2014 which in practice means meeting my most coveted sources at a set date, time and place once a quarter.What tech tools or web services do you avoid to prevent sensitive information from being exposed?Also, I stay far from any app that has not been vetted by Google Play or Apple. It\u2019s disturbingly easy for cybercriminals to design apps that mimic a benign, mainstream product, then plant it in third-party app stores. Once downloaded, those apps potentially have access to every critical piece of information you store on your phone, by which I mean everything.Well, actually the worst-case scenario is someone taking control of my self-driving car. It will be a while before I feel safe buying one of those.As for what I did, I signed up for the credit monitoring, froze my credit and then banged my head against my desk a few more times. This is actually the second time my information has been stolen. I used Anthem for insurance, which was nearly as bad. At this point, all I can do is freeze my credit, change my passwords, set stricter security settings on my life and pray.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? For a tech reporter, I\u2019m actually fairly agnostic about tech in general. I\u2019m not one of those people constantly experimenting with the latest, greatest apps and services. I do not understand Snapchat. Do emojis count? I am bullish on emojis.I do use Instacart, though I wish I wasn\u2019t that lazy. And I am one of Spotify\u2019s biggest users. I probably make a new playlist once a week, then I blast it through the house via Sonos. I use Google Docs and Dropbox for work. I try my best to stay off Facebook, but I do use Instagram, mostly to entertain my dog\u2019s followers. He has his own account: \u201cHomerthebestdog,\u201d though we just had to change the name to accommodate our new puppy, so now it\u2019s \u201cHomerandHanzo.\u201d (Sorry, Homes!)What could be better about the tech?I believe in free speech. But I do not believe in free speech for robots.Smartphones have been equipped with fingerprint sensors for years. Now Apple is moving into face recognition for unlocking a phone. Like or dislike, and why?That\u2019s a tough question. I am in favor of anything that replaces passwords. Passwords are useless, annoying and security\u2019s weakest link. So initially I applauded Apple\u2019s move to fingerprint sensors.I think they raise legitimate concerns. But I\u2019m also of the mind-set that the people I worry most about having access to my face template \u2014 namely spies or cybercriminals I\u2019ve angered with my reporting \u2014 will be able to access anything they want about me with enough time and resources, anyway.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Documenting Sports With Tech, or It Didn\u2019t Happen", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow has technology transformed sports reporting? The biggest transformation has been the use of social media, and Twitter is the opium of the sports-reporting masses. When I started doing this 20 years ago, I didn\u2019t know what the competition was reporting until I fetched the newspapers from the porch in the morning.Now there's a race to see who can tweet something first. It doesn\u2019t matter how mundane or irrelevant it is. I can watch a football game, and within 15 seconds of the last play, my feed will have seven tweets all saying \u201cFirst down.\u201d Isn\u2019t that useful? Twitter has turned a lot of sports reporting into play-by-play, hot takes and snarky one-liners. With retweets and replies, the echo can be deafening.But most people still have stories to write. So at the end of games, when the important stuff is happening, none of the reporters are tweeting because they're all writing on deadline so that their story can hit the web first. It is speed versus substance. I\u2019m glad to report that substance is making a comeback.What tech gadgetry and apps do you always have with you when you\u2019re on assignment?The game changer was the smartphone. It's not only my office phone. I can also use it to record interviews (its microphone is better than the one in my old Olympus, which is important in crowded, noisy places), take pictures and videos to help me remember the details of what I see, and even type or speak notes and interview answers into emails that I send myself.I use it the way other people use their phones. I email, text, tweet, post to Instagram, get directions, set timers and alarms, change flights, check weather, update my calendar, map my jogs, and listen to podcasts and Spotify during long drives or plane rides. On assignment, I\u2019ve had entire conversations with Google Translate, two of us passing my phone back and forth.Besides being an all-in-one communication tool, the iPhone helps my writing. I take photographs of places I know I\u2019ll want to describe in detail later \u2014 the inside of someone\u2019s home, a rocky mountain summit, a piece of jewelry that a subject is wearing, the shape of the clouds and the color of the sky. I take videos of places, too, and narrate them as I shoot so that I can watch and listen later.I get a lot of strange looks from people when I do these things.What tech product are you currently obsessed with?I use it to text, but also to trade photographs, short videos and voice messages, instantly. And you can call from it, even use it for face-to-face video conversations, free if you\u2019re on Wi-Fi.My wife was recently on a ship in the North Atlantic, and one morning I was in bed, having simultaneous conversations with her, a friend in Brazil and a reporting colleague in Nepal, all using text, photos and audio. Then someone from the office emailed me, which felt very 15 years ago.You\u2019ve covered a lot of extreme sports. How has tech changed those sports and the way you report them?So many times, I\u2019ve seen something amazing online, maybe something worth a story, only to realize that it has been \u201cliked\u201d 100,000 times already. So we tend to write about trends, not single events, and people, not just their accomplishments. We focus on the context, not the clip. That\u2019s tough in a never-ending stream of clips.How has tech been good or bad for sports in general?More than anything, technology has brought the sports world into the \u201cnow.\u201d I\u2019m old enough to remember a world before ESPN, when the N.B.A. Finals were tape-delayed to late night and baseball had a \u201cgame of the week,\u201d and that was the only game you could see. There were no sports highlights beyond your local news, and you hoped the late scores made the morning paper.Now we can see almost any game on television, in a dozen sports from anywhere in the world, with a computer on our laps and a phone in our hands. We receive and give instant analysis through the world of social media. We can track statistics for our fantasy teams. We can tweet nasty messages to famous athletes and coaches who disappoint us. Like so many other parts of society, we\u2019re probably watching sports more physically alone than ever, but more connected in other ways.Is that good or bad? Just different. Part of me wishes I could recreate the simple times of attending a game the way I did with my parents. It was an era of hard bleachers and no video scoreboards, of tracking players through nothing but printed box scores, of using your imagination to fill in all the details of the sports world that were left mostly blank.That would probably bore my kids.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Simple Ways to Be Better at Remembering", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the sum total of human knowledge rests an arm\u2019s length away in each person\u2019s pocket, why do we have to remember anything anymore?Mr. LeDoux, whose work focuses on how the brain forms memories, said this instant-fact setup clouds our judgment on what information to filter and store. Since we\u2019re no longer weighed down by having to retain trivial data, we are left with greater cognitive space. But how do we select what we remember?Memory is a fallible thing, changing over time. Recalling a long-term memory brings it back into our short-term memory, which essentially gives it new context. Memory is therefore a reconstruction, not a photographic recording, and for economic purposes, our brains \u2014 unlike computers \u2014 are forever rerecording those memories, making them far more error prone.On top of that, we now live inside dual screens and endless browser tabs, headphones streaming music, smartphones buzzing, co-workers chatting with us on Slack \u2014 all while we should be performing the actual jobs we\u2019re paid to be doing.Mr. LeDoux added: \u201cThe brain does have limitations to what it can process or handle.\u201dThey\u2019re both right, but there are still things we can do to improve our memories.As simple as it sounds, the repetition of tasks \u2014 reading, or saying words over and over \u2014 continues to be the best method for transforming short-term memories into long-term ones. To do that, we have to retrain our minds to focus on one task at a time. Sadly, most bypass this formula because we\u2019re already convinced we\u2019re productive.New connections are made in your brain when you learn. To remember what you learn, do what you probably did in your youth: Repeat words, thoughts and ideas over and over until you get them right. It\u2019s the easiest brain game there is.Forget cramming. It didn\u2019t work in college, it doesn\u2019t work now. Spaced repetition might be the best way.But once you stop rehearsing that knowledge, the retention drops profoundly. Researchers call this the \u201cforgetting curve.\u201dTo get past it, space out your repetition over a few days and test the effect yourself. But be careful: Spacing out sessions or scheduling them too concurrently seem to slow gains, so find a healthy medium that works. This is a good way to effectively start tackling a new language.Memory and focus go hand-in-hand. Dr. Cowan suggests rearranging our office setup as one way to improve focus. He believes the collaborative start-up design and open offices touted by Silicon Valley\u2019s hoodied C.E.O.s actually make us far less productive because they create added distractions. How do you stay on task if your co-worker is piloting a drone or endlessly, and loudly, snacking just inches away?\u201cThe rebirth of the open workplace cannot be helping this situation,\u201d Dr. Cowan said, alluding to work spaces without desks, physical barriers and privacy, but with a plethora of playthings. Yoga rooms, rock climbing and gardens can be great perks, but they can make it difficult to deliver on deadline with so much stimuli.\u201cMemory is very cue dependent,\u201d he said, referring to something he calls absent-minded memory failure. \u201cMost say it could never happen to me, but it\u2019s a very long list of responsible people that it has happened to. When you don\u2019t have that cue, you can forget almost anything.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe really tricky thing about absent-minded memory failure is it can affect almost anything if the cue is not present at the moment you need to catch a reaction.\u201dA simple way around that is to set reminders. Even better, combine a few of these techniques: Write your reminder on a Post-it and put it on your desk so you\u2019re forced to repeatedly look at it over a prolonged period, incorporating the practice of spaced repetition. Build on your memory by combining these approaches. Modern life offers few guarantees, but using even one of these tips is surely an improvement.\u201cA lot of people are overconfident that they can handle distractions,\u201d Mr. Schacter said. \u201cDoing two things at once always has an effect. Be aware of the situation you\u2019re in and understand when you let attention divide you, you\u2019re likely to pay the price. In some situations it may not matter, but in others it could change everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Report When the Science Is Sketchy", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was such an idealistic notion \u2014 information should be free. No one should have to pay to read an article in a scientific journal. But I should have expected that the law of unintended consequences would kick in.But open access began with the best of intentions. It\u2019s expensive to publish a journal. You need an editorial staff and you need a coterie of trusted experts to review papers and advise on publication. The question is: Who pays for it all?For traditional journals, subscribers do. Or you can pay what can be a hefty fee for a single paper. The problem is that the traditional model shuts out people who cannot afford what can be more than a hundred-dollar-a-year subscription. And if you are a serious scientist, you need more than one. The costs mount quickly. People in poor countries, who may not have access to libraries with subscriptions, were especially disadvantaged.Enter open access. Papers are free \u2014 the money comes from the authors, who must pay to be published. There are well-respected open-access journals, with standards as high as traditional ones.What happened, and what few expected, was the birth of open-access journals that will take just about any paper, for a fee. They don\u2019t bother with the pesky expense of reviewers and they publish only online, so their costs are minimal. They send blandishing emails to scientists, inviting them to publish with them. There are now thousands of them, about as many as there are legitimate journals.And because the names of these journals often mimic those of respected ones, some researchers have been tricked into submitting papers. I was first introduced to the phenomenon of predatory journals a few years ago, when a professor of medicine at Stanford told me he had learned of a journal with almost the same name as a prestigious one he edited. His was called Clinical Trials. The other was called Clinical Trials & Patenting. There was, he and others said, a world of difference between the two.Along the way they earned the \u201cpredatory\u201d epithet, because they were thought to be taking advantage of innocent scientists. But, I learned, predation is only a small part of the story. Many \u2014 probably most \u2014 academics who publish in these journals know exactly what they are doing. They are padding their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, taking advantage of the fact that colleges may not know if a journal is legitimate or not. When the number of publications a person has can determine his or her chances for advancement, some decide to take the easy route.So what is a journalist to do? We don\u2019t want to be tricked by flimsy science. But it turns out to be a lot easier for us to avoid than you might think.Here\u2019s the little secret of most science journalism. We usually rely on experts who publish in the most prestigious journals for advice on the legitimacy of papers. I keep an extensive and ever growing list of researchers who are knowledgeable, honest, and tuned in to the latest research and its implications. If a paper looks interesting I will call on one or two of them and ask: \u201cIs the work credible? Does it advance the field? Are there caveats I should know about?\u201d And when we are looking for major advances or breaking news, we rely on papers from those prestigious journals.I have changed one of my practices, though. I used to use Google Scholar when I was looking into an area that was new to me. But now that I know that Google Scholar does not vet the journals it lists, I avoid it. Of course, as the chocolate debacle showed, not everyone who writes about science does so exclusively or has a network of experts to consult. And some papers seem so tantalizing that they are, as we say caustically, \u201ctoo good to check.\u201dSo scientists, journalists and university job search committees: Buyer beware.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maria Bamford: The First Time Someone Loved Me for Who I Really Am", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe First TimeAt the age of 43, I had never had a relationship last more than a year. My colleagues in comedy suggested that it was par for the course in our business, and that paired with my psychiatric issues, I might never be eligible for lifelong commitment. But strangely, it was when I was hospitalized in a psych ward that I first found real hope that I could be married one day.Back in 2010, I had been dating a guy for a few months. It was a fast romance, but he broke it off quickly and kindly when he discovered that I was having problems with what I thought was just bad depression.After the breakup, I decided it was the perfect time to try a new medication, a mood stabilizer that my psychiatrist had recommended. Then I signed myself into a facility because I was a little scared of killing myself. \u201cSeventy-two hours on the new med, and I\u2019ll be good as new,\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cThen off to four shows in Chicago!\u201d No matter how bad I felt, work came first.At a hospital in Pasadena, Calif., I was speaking with a fellow jittery patient. He was in his early 50s and said that he had bipolar disorder. I was worried whether I would ever work again, so I asked him what he did. He said he had left a high-stress position in international law and now worked part-time at a used bookstore in the San Bernardino Valley. He had been on disability for several years and needed to enter a mental health facility about once a year for flare-ups of depression or mania.I checked out of the hospital a few days later, hoping to feel better on the new medication. But as I flew to Chicago, I knew something was wrong. I somehow ended up bleeding, hysterical and lost downtown without any identification an hour before showtime. My manager heard me hyperventilating over the phone and canceled all four shows.Thus began a breakdown. Every moment of my life felt unbearable for a year and a half of hospitalizations and outpatient treatment programs. I drooled, I dropped glassware, I passed out face-first into Caesar salads. I could not think, had difficulty speaking and could not \u2014 in any way \u2014 work.I kept asking other patients the same questions: \u201cDo you still have a job? Do you think you\u2019ll ever be able to work again?\u201d I kept asking my doctors when they thought I\u2019d be well enough to go back to comedy. Of course, none of them could guarantee full recovery. But I did gather some surprising information that I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in at the time: Many patients had partners and wives and husbands.There was the wife and mother of grown children receiving ECT treatments that caused short term memory loss. A young woman who, after a psychotic episode involving the K.G.B. and aliens, spoke of her longtime boyfriend and all the support he provided when she was fired from her sales job. There was the man who came into the ward after a manic, knife-wielding episode in which he might have stabbed someone (I was very out of it and couldn\u2019t get the whole story). He chatted amiably with his wife during visiting hours.Over and over again, I encountered people with debilitating mental illness who were also part of a couple. They weren\u2019t working, they needed care. They were a burden. And yet they were loved.I started to think: That could be me. If I ever got better, maybe I would meet someone who could love me as I am. That maybe, work or no work, I\u2019d no longer have to wait to be \u201clovable\u201d (translation: \u201cproductive\u201d) in order to be loved.And I was right. A year and a half later, when my mood had stabilized (I still had a tremor and memory problems), I met a man named Scott through OkCupid. It was his second internet date; my 97th. It wasn\u2019t particularly magical, just nice. We met for coffee, and he was easy to talk to. I love art, and that\u2019s what he does; he thought I was funny and loves comedy. He really wanted to go out again, despite the fact that he had Googled me and knew about my perceived deal-breaker. On our second date \u2014 a hike with my dog in Griffith Park \u2014 he was eager to share his own perceived flaws ($52,000 in student loans! Arthritis! An overheating \u201992 Saturn! Can\u2019t travel by airplane! )And then, on our fourth date, he said one of the most romantic things I\u2019ve ever heard: \u201cI know they don\u2019t let you have sharp stuff in the psych ward. When my mom was in there, she grew a little beard. If that happens to you, I\u2019ll come in and shave your beard!\u201d His mother, Linda, has passed away, but I think she\u2019d be proud that her son is ready with a Daisy razor. I\u2019ve been stable for the past several years, but I am comforted by that promise of support.Our mutual failure with long-term relationships (Scott had made it to three years) is weirdly what makes us both so committed and connected. As they say in 12-step recovery, it\u2019s weakness, not strength, that binds us to each other. Scott and I have been moody in front of each other many times, most recently when we moved and he saw me scream for the first time. Over a television placement.But we talked about what is now called The Regrettable Incident of the Television Placement with our couples therapist the next day and later laughed about it with friends. And Scott has had his own embarrassing emotional lows, too. It\u2019s no secret who we are and what our flaws are. I think that\u2019s what love is \u2014 not having to hide exactly who you are. We got married on March 14, 2015, and have been together for four years, breaking both of our previous records.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of the writer\u2019s wedding. It was on March 14, 2015 \u2014 not April 13, 2015.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boko Haram, Happiness, Graffiti and Beets: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationYou know, I am really impressed by these kids. It\u2019s like, \u201cAll is not lost! There are intelligent, insightful, strong, compassionate, decent kids out there! There is hope for the future after all!\u201dWhat are you reading, watching or listening to in The Times right now? Add a comment on this post and let us know, or choose one of our recent writing prompts and weigh in._________After reading this article I have realized some of the terrible things that people with twisted minds are willing to do. Sending innocent children to kill themselves and others. And the visuals in the article help you picture what is going on. It makes you feel more attached to the characters. The determination of some of the girls is very good.The breathtaking visuals and quotes enhanced the realness of the unthinkable tale. On top of that, the article had my attention the whole time as it was hard hitting and thorough. The text makes the reader think without realizing they\u2019re thinking with its high qualityAfter reading this article it gave me a new outlook on society today. The fact that teenage girls our age, kidnapped and forced to strap bombs to their backs and told to walk right to suicide is disgusting. Nobody should have to live a life of such horror... The fact that these two girls had the strength to just sit down and talk about this is humbling.This article really made me think and use every ounce of empathy and compassion in my body. I can\u2019t even fathom how absolutely mortifying and horrific their experience must\u2019ve been. It\u2019s awful that such a thing had to happen to such intelligent young girls. At the same time, I really admire their sense of drive and determination to escape the situation. Being brainwashed and under that pressure would seem like there was no way out. If I was put in their shoes, I surely wouldn\u2019t have reacted as collectively and responsibly as these girls did in such a dire situation. Its awful that people there are unsafe around women because of what these awful people have done to them.When life goes down the wrong path and everything seems to be against you, where do you turn? When you do not know where to look for help and those who should be helping you are nowhere to be seen, to whom do you go? The Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria are living this exact same experience. But instead of your one bad day, this is there life now. Until someone comes to help or life or neighbors unexpectedly gets better, they are not going anywhere. They must turn to themselves and their neighbors, for the government is nowhere to be seen. They must start to rely on primitive survival skills and do whatever they can to keep living in some resemblance of normalcy. People who usually get by well are now stuck into the prison known as poverty and the ones who were already in that prison, find no escape. The hurricane brought no hope or goodwill in its constant wind and rain luggage. The people must provide this for themselves. The people must create their own hope of survival and their own goodwill towards their neighbors as together they survive through the night. And the next one, and the next one, until life returns to its state of normalcy and the faint memories of these terrible nights fade away.\u201cWild and Captive Chimpanzees Share Personality Traits With Humans,\u201d was an enthralling read. It is fascinating that Chimpanzees share many personality traits with humans. Some of these include anxiety, depression, and self-control... This experiment should be preformed on other animals, such as dogs. If it proves that dogs experience similar emotions, it is amazing to think your dog could be feeling the same anxiety or depression as you.I think it is cool how scientists can study these chimpanzees and see how their personality and attitude can connect to our lives. They said that wild and captive chimpanzees had similar personality traits. I also thought it was heartwarming seeing Jane Goodall observe and care for the chimpanzees in Gombe National Park in what today is modern Tanzania.Some questions I had while reading,How do scientists accurately understand animals personalities and attitudes?Why do wild and captive chimpanzees have the same traits?Do chimpanzees attitudes change as they get older like humans?How many traits do humans and chimps commonly share?Jane is an amazing role model, for example, she doesn\u2019t care what other\u2019s think but rather strives to be different and unique. This is the kind of motivation girl\u2019s need today to show them that they can break the sexist boundaries that the society has put up.I felt that this situation is good, not only for the place it was about, but for cities too. Removing large highways and freeways can totally open a city back up and make it a more beautiful place. I think it would be cool if a freeway was decommissioned and turned into a long park. Like the concrete would be covered with grass and trees. It would be good for running and biking. Especially if a raised freeway became this, it would be like a park on legs! I think cities should look into this, I think it would be cool to rebuild a city by destroying a crucial part to it.The idea that Google\u2019s technologists are considering designing a major city from the internet is unbelievable. In my opinion, I can\u2019t even comprehend what Toronto, the chosen city, would look like if this was done. When the article explained a few of the features the city could offer, such as a thermal energy grid, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if every city in the future would accommodate such technology. But then again, how successful could such a large, complicated project be? To me, the concept seems like the beginning of a dystopian story where technology controls a world displayed as a utopia. Yes, the illustration within the article looks like a place where I would want to live, but is it too good to be true? Can a city run by technology solve all of our problems and live up to its expectations?Reading this article, the thought occurred to me that there are myriad career paths one may choose to follow in life. As shown in this excerpt, there are actually biologists that study the molecular levels and evolution of beets. This made me wonder how these people came to ask \u201chmm... why exactly is a beet red?\u201d or \u201cIs this beet\u2019s redness due to the same reason why a cranberry is red?\u201d.It all seems so completely incredible how an adult can still ask the questions of a child. And society still says that adults have no imagination... just look at this article! I learned that beets are their trademark scarlet red due to amino acids like tyrosine, developed further by enzymes to accentuate the hue. The writer that one of the reasons why beets are red is to attract pollinators with their dazzling appearance. If this piece of news wasn\u2019t mindboggling enough, I also learned that beets have enzymes \u201c...that increase the tyrosine used to make the painkilling molecule, [and] could have effects on how that drug and others are made...\u201dIn all, this article by Veronique Greenwood responded to the question that I didn\u2019t even know I wanted an answer to. And that\u2019s pretty awesome.As I read this article, I felt sympathetic towards both the families of Rachel Nguyen and Joseph Orbeso. Rachel and Joseph were only in their early twenties when they died. Things like this always make me think that if they did something different, like chose a different trail to hike on, they wouldn\u2019t have died. This article really does prove that one small decision can make a huge impact. I also couldn\u2019t help but think just how terrified Rachel and Joseph were, they probably were wondering how long until they would be rescued, that is if anyone would ever find them. It\u2019s a scary thought, but stories like these make me value life a little more.In reading the article, \u201c Soldier\u2019s Widow Says Trump Struggled to Remember Sgt. La David Johnson\u2019s Name\u201d, my disgust and utter embarrassment only grew for the president. Not only did he have the audacity to say \u201cHe knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway,\u201d to a woman who lost her husband in combat, he couldn\u2019t even remember the brave man\u2019s name.Many will try to defend this man by saying he was nice enough to even call, but this response in sad and lacks evidence of care. It is customary for widows/families of fallen soldiers to be contacted by the president since the draft was put in place. Even then, Trump was many weeks late to his call and left the family with many unanswered questions. Along with the refusal to let Sgt. Johnson\u2019s wife, see the body.This one situation is just another example of why Donald Trump is unfitting for the role of president. From his disrespect for justice, women, and fallen soldiers, he is just far too immature._________The majority of readers agreed that to achieve bliss, one must first encounter hardship.Let\u2019s say you have to learn a dance for a show you\u2019re doing. You can\u2019t seem to get this one step and you just keep struggling and doing it over and over. Until one day you finally get that step, you successfully hit that step right on beat. You feel that euphoria of finally hitting that step correctly, you get that sense of accomplishment and happiness. Now if you were to just easily hit that step and get the dance overall, you\u2019re just doing it over and over again and it becomes boring because you know you can do it, it\u2019s easy.In one period of my life, I struggled with depression. But, until I hit that cold, rock bottom, was when I truly started coming up and feeling better as a person. After overcoming something so unhealthy, I felt happier than ever. I became a lot more grateful and compassionate.By going through the hardships and struggles life throws your way, you realize that each time that you were knocked down you stood up taller...What you do not realize is that the struggle you faced taught you lessons, and without those lessons, you are bound to make the same mistakes eventually.I guarantee you that in any sport if you don\u2019t practice and show up and expect the best results they will not come simply because you haven\u2019t put in the work in order to achieve greatness. If you ever look at any successful scholar, artist, entrepreneur, or athlete; they\u2019ve all been through some sort of struggle to be considered successful, and success is how many measure happiness.I draw happiness mostly from my family and friends. But i also draw happiness from everyday things like laughing and talking to friends. Yes i do think every human being can find happiness in something, even if it is just being happy with being alive.Most of us think that happiness is in materialism, buying clothes, shoes, accessories, etc. But, this is called consumerism and a lot of people believe that they are happy because they possess those kind of things. However, I agree with the author, I believe that the happiness is in the simple things of life such as have health, tranquility, have access to education and know that my family is good.A few commenters, though, disagreed, and felt struggle can reduce happiness.In my opinion, happiness can also be defined of the lack of struggle in life. I know that the times where I feel most happy are times when there is nothing bugging at the back of my mind or making me worry about the future. Anticipation for events and goals to come, whether they be positive or negative, causes me great stress, which dilutes any happiness that I may have experienced before the event had the potential to happen.If you have many problems in your environment where you grow, of course you may be feeling empty, and nothing is enough for you. It is so difficult to find the Happiness and it is possible you see everything black, and not see any light, not see any future...If you feeling depress you can\u2019t dream, you can\u2019t love what do you... You need looking the solution in your life first._________In my opinion, Justin Timberlake is the perfect person to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show. He is known by a wide variety of age ranges. My parents listen to Justin Timberlake, my friends and I listen to him, my older brother and his friends, as well as my younger brother and his friends, even my very young cousins, enjoy listening to Justin Timberlake\u2019s music.I think he would be a great and memorable halftime performer. In recent years, he has released more upbeat songs that would get the crowd excited for the last half of the Super bowl game. Because he has been capturing the hearts of many generations, it would be a great experience for everyone in the family. However, I would enjoy seeing a new face show off their talent. I\u2019ve been loving Sam Smith lately, but his songs would be too down for the occasion. Perhaps I\u2019d enjoy if Kendrick Lamar killed the stage with his catchy and relatable tunes.Justin Timberlake is a terrible choice. To start with he has already performed at the halftime show. I swear the NFL just pulled out a phone book started calling some numbers and chose the first person that picked up.This is lazy, find someone new. Speaking of new, that is exactly what Timberlake isn\u2019t he is a blast from the past. I don\u2019t even know one of his songs. Who the heck was he did he perform solo, was he in a band? I don\u2019t know. The performer for the half-time show has to be someone new, who appeals to all audiences. Someone like Kanye West, the Weekend, or Taylor Swift just to name a few better candidates.To be honest i think he is a very talented artist however his music is not my cup of tea...Who I would want to preform at the super bowl half time show would be, Lil Dickey, Lil Yatchy, Hopsin. Notice these are all rappers and for me Justin Timberlake just doesn\u2019t have any upbeat to get the football teams fired up.And many students gave their own recommendations for who should perform instead.I would like to see Lil Yachty, Kodak Black and Ugly God. I think that they would put on a show at halftime because I personally think that they are currently some of America\u2019s greatest rappers.It would be nice to see someone new do the performance, rather than Katy Perry or Beyonce, but that\u2019s just me. If I was able to pick someone, I would want to see someone like DJ Snake or something. I love their music and how they set up their music and performances, but at the same time they could also have guest singers too like MO or Justin Bieber.If I could see anyone perform at the Super Bowl it would be Bruno Mars. He is a pop sensation that everyone knows and many of his songs are played on the radio. His music is fun, and I think he could get the crowd really involved with his performance.If I could see anyone perform at the Super Bowl it would be a band like Pantera. They would have to replace their guitar player for the show because he has passed, but I think Pantera has changed music. Just seeing some rock and metal music at a big show like this would shock the world and be absolutely awesome for people that love metal or rock music.If I could see anyone perform the Halftime show I would have to pick the British rock band Queen. I know that this is unlikely as Freddie Mercury, the band\u2019s\u2019 lead singer, died in 1991; I would love to see the band perform the Halftime show nonetheless. Their music was exoctic for the time and whenever I listen to their music it\u2019s always a breath of fresh air.If I could see anyone perform at the halftime show it would be a mixture of three people. The three people would be Lil Yachty, ugly god, and Ice JJ Fish. These are three of my favorite rappers and they would put an an amazing halftime show. They are also well known throughout america so everyone could vibe to it_________While we love reading about your personal experiences and opinions, we get extra excited when you respond to one of our creative writing prompts.Being the shy girl she is, she never got too close to others. Some actually blamed it on her \u201cproblem,\u201d but the doctors never called it that. And the doctor\u2019s were her closest friends. They told her what was going on, asked her how she was doing, answered her questions, treated her somewhat like the person she was. Now, she\u2019s stuck with another girl, in a closed ward. The other girl almost didn\u2019t realize she was there, but she couldn\u2019t stop watching the other girl. She was fascinated. Everything the other girl did was so natural to her, yet it was so unusual. Most other girls never got too close to her, but now she has the chance to get close to another girl. The chance for a new friend.I look at my new foster sister and I wonder \u201chow is she doing so well?\u201d There she laid spread over the bed. Looking at the ceiling.\u201cHey Annabel, do you unpack everything?\u201d\u201cLook and see.\u201dLook and see. She said to every question I asked. She always would smile after saying it too.\u201cAnnabel, do you feel well?\u201d I waited for her response. Annabel looked at the ceiling some more. Then she stood upright. She looked at me and gave me a big toothy smile. I got up from my bed and stride towards her bed. I loom over her. I tried to smile.\u201cYou can tell me anything you are worried about, you know that right?\u201d\u201cYou are scared. Look it is all over your face. See?\u201d Annabel pointed to the floor with a grin on her face. I followed her finger and saw something unbelievable. A monster slowly forming. I took a step back. I dash over to my bed, and with every step, the floor seemed to become water. When I got there, I yelled at Annabel, \u201cWhat is happening!?\u201d\u201cLook and see.\u201dThe monster started to form. The shape of it looks like me.A cold sweat covered me to head and toe when I looked at it. Annabel\u2019s grin left her face. She turns away from me and the copy. Glancing back to me then flopping on the bed, belly side down.\u201cDo you not want to see?\u201d She asked sounding upset.\u201cMake it disappear!\u201d Annabel reaches to the floor and touched it. The floor moved like water and the copy of me disappeared. I put my hand to my mouth in shock. Who is Annabel? And why is she, my foster sister?When I see people denying that graffiti is art, I think of Jean-Michel Basquiat. Basquiat first achieved fame as a graffiti artist in Lower Manhattan in the 1970\u2019s. Nowadays, though he has been dead for 29 years, his art sells for millions upon millions of dollars. He could have gone nowhere, and we wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy his art today if not for the spray paint pieces he made when he was a teenager. It is a similar situation for Keith Haring, who painted on buildings both legally and illegally. I\u2019m not condoning law breaking, but would we would be better off without the works of Keith Haring and Jean-Michael Basquiat?Do buildings that can have the paint washed off of them matter more than the budding creativity that could belong to a new Basquiat or Haring?I believe that graffiti is an expression of skill and creativity that conveys important messages and evokes powerful thoughts and emotions.Though I believe that graffiti is owned by the artists themselves, I wish that there was some sort of formal, legal way of granting the permission to paint the owner\u2019s property without the risk of arrest nor the risk of having it covered or removed without the artist\u2019s permission.Graffiti is a significant part of urban American culture that has the right to be viewed in person and not just in pictures.Imagine that something that you worked so hard on, that held meaning for you, was destroyed. How would you feel? In my opinion, aerosol art most definitely classifies as a work of art. These works of art hold meaning and give a unique and vibrant decoration to our society. The artist who makes the aerosol art should be the owner of that art because they are the ones who put in the hard work in making these masterpieces. But I also understand the fact that whoever owns the property might not want their building covered in graffiti.If an artist is hired or asked to paint a mural or create any other piece of art, I do not consider this graffiti. I consider this to be commissioned art that is allowed to be there. Graffiti is illegal artwork that an artist put in a place regardless of what the rules are. I don\u2019t think graffiti should be protected. If people want art on walls or the side of bridges, they can just hire an artist to do it for them.I don\u2019t think the artist owns the graffiti if they have painted it on someone else\u2019s private property...If you want to make graffiti or \u201caerosol art\u201d you can create it on your own property. But I do not believe it should be protected unless you were asked to make it._________I believe that men do have it easier than women doing things in their everyday lives. For one, if you look at certain careers in most situation you will find that men are a lot more favored than women. For instance, when you think of the medical field, you automatically assume that men are doctors and women are nurses. This is because 74% of doctors are male (26% female), while 91% of nurses tend to be female (9% male). If you wonder why these statistics are true, it\u2019s because society predetermines these roles for men and women.In my opinion, men do have it easier than women. Women are burdened with a great deal of responsibilities in her life. No matter what, every girl is going to be judged in their life. Whether it is the way she feels, acts, works or takes care of things, the fear of acceptance is a major problem in a girl\u2019s life. Her acceptance or approval is decided by the critical world. Men are not judged the way a women is. They have always been able to vote, run for office, and own property. Although gender equality is becoming more equal in the past, men have had all the rights. Women have traditionally been treated like second class citizens and it will take years for the effects to go away.I think girls/women have it easier because boys/men are always buying them things and taking them out to eat.A free meal does not even come close to covering the earning difference between men and women. I\u2019d rather the opportunity to make an equal wage. You can keep your meal and your expectation for sex afterwards._________A work of art that changed my life was Shane Koyczan\u2019s poem, \u2018To This Day\u2019. It is a monologue about bullying and how it impacted his life and the lives of two people he knows...This came into my life at a great time because I had started getting into stupid kid drama. I was always sad and I felt like no one would really understand, until I heard this one day in dance class and I was overwhelmed by emotion and I can safely say I haven\u2019t felt the same since.Now, every time I start to feel upset about bullying and drama, I listen to this again and I feel like I\u2019m not alone anymore.the work of art that inspires me the most is the movie how to train your dragon from a animation studio called dream works...The message is that you can find friends in unlikely places and that you shouldnt judge everyone by the bad done by the few of their kind. therefore this movie inspires me to try and be friends with anyone and everyone no matter what they look like, and that i need to work hard to be able to produce my own animations.Dorothy Bryant\u2019s book \u201cThe Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You\u201d begins badly and soon becomes magnificent. Probably read it 20 times over the years since it first came out.The work of art that inspires me is cliche as of now, but I still hold it in high regards. Lin Manuel-Miranda\u2019s \u201cHamilton\u201d inspires me to remember the people who paved the way for America Today. It also inspires me through it\u2019s song and rap lyrics to live life and make my part in someone else\u2019s story so they can tell mine.My own \u201cM.Butterfly\u201d is a song. This song is Girls/Girls/Boys by Panic! At the Disco. Girls/Girls/Boys inspires to to work for a world without hate. It inspires me to work for a world with equality. The song is about being yourself, and not really caring what others think. Knowing this song exists helps me understand and accept myself. The music piece helps me let go of all of my worries and stress.The work of art that has changed my life is Makoto Shinkai\u2019s, Kimi no Na wa. In the movie, both characters experience a huge change in their lives and they have to learn to cope with it. In this case, their appearances change entirely. This movie has showed me that I can be confident in whoever I am and in whatever I look like._________Many thought the image had to do with freedom of speech.This picture represents people as a whole not having the power of freedom of speech. I say this because not everyone everywhere has the power to speak out about there thoughts and beliefs. In America, citizens have freedom of speech and the right to protest peacefully. However, citizens in many other countries don\u2019t have that power to speak out about there believes, and this picture is exactly explaining just that.To me I think this picture represents somebody who has some things they would like to say but there being stopped. Luckily, we have the First Amendment which states \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\u201d But according to some people they still don\u2019t believe people have the right to state some things. This is related to how people have the right to speech on and off of their job. In my opinion I think that people have the right to do anything that the 27 amendments say.Others believed the illustration was related to the idea of political correctness.People are not allowed to say what they want to because too many people get hurt and offended. Americans these days take every word you say and turn it around into something racial or political. The person who created this picture probably feels like they do not have a right to say what they want and to say what they feel.Everyone is crazy about our country having freedom of speech, but when someone says a comment they believe in they are automatically judge. Is that really what freedom is supposed to be?I think this is about how many people believe that freedom of speech has somehow been taken away from us in the recent years, just because people will tell you when something offends them, or they will ask you to stop saying it. The people who say this don\u2019t really understand freedom of speech. True freedom of speech is being able to say whatever you want, and being able to tell other people whatever you want about what they said. If you say that you hate a certain race, you can expect people of this race (or even not of that race) telling you that they don\u2019t like your opinion. If you don\u2019t want people to be mad at you or be offended by your comment, don\u2019t make the comment. Being prepared for backlash to your opinions is a good human skill people should learn.I think this picture relate to when people are being ruled by someone that doesn\u2019t want them to tell the truth. And I think this is a big problem in any country, an example is when a big secret is discover and the government say that they don\u2019t know about this, but they know everything about it.i think that the guy is depressed and he want to ask for help or needs to talk to some one but something doesn\u2019t let him. some people tend to feel this way because they might feel lonely or maybe something happen to them and just cant tell no one because someone is telling them not too. they might even be bullied by someone and they want to speak up but they cant_________Having an educational system that encourages experiential learning and personality development has many benefits. It allows you to be less stressed about getting a good grade and becoming more focused on learning and keeping the knowledge you have obtained...Instead of having people who are drones of society, we need problem solvers that think outside the box to develop new ideas. People like Steve Jobs who shaped the way we lived to day thought outside of the box on everything that they did. If everyone was just worried about some meaningless letter grade and their test scores, then our society would never advance. Nobody would come up with new ideas that shape the future.The idea behind education is you can\u2019t be successful without a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. This makes succeeding more important than learning, so kids are more focused on passing than actually understanding the material.My school has great resources and staff, and the curriculum is usually challenging but not too difficult; however, most kids I know are experienced cheaters because of the workload and how much is graded. We are told if we get bad test scores we aren\u2019t smart and the teachers\u2019 careers are dependent on how the students perform. AP classes are pushed if not forced on students to boost the rating of the school in terms of students in high level classes. I think if it was more relaxed and encouraged more learning from free will, students would perform better.The school that I currently attend is a very competitive school. We frequently compete with other schools in sports or clubs like the robotics club. At the same time, our school is somewhat focused on academic success but it mainly seems to care about memorization. The students\u2019 job is to memorize the content, get tested on it, and receive a grade for it. It\u2019s rare that the students are tested on the topic again. They just move on to the next topic and forget the old one.In my opinion, this is no way to educate students. If they are just going to forget about it, why even teach the content? The worst part is that many students don\u2019t even know what they don\u2019t know, so they don\u2019t realize how much teaching they have forgotten or what to relearn. It seems like our school is so oriented on competitiveness that we\u2019re trying to make up for the faulty education system, but it is not working._________It is important that the Obamas chose contemporary African-American artists because it is a defiance of the traditional ways that have been established and allows for the exposure of artists and art styles that have been less than abundant in a white-dominated field.Compared to past presidential portraits, I think that the Obamas\u2019 portraits will be much more vibrant in color and will emphasize their distinct black features. The work of the two artists is full of bright colors and are all portraits of black men and women, young and old, in different places and clothing, very much unlike the past presidential portraits.I am only familiar with a few black artists like Elizabeth Catlett and Jean-Michel Basquiat. But after viewing his work now, I\u2019d would choose Kehinde Wiley to create a portrait of me. I love the boldness of his art and how he seems to pay close attention to details using light and shadows.I feel when people think of portraits, they think of paintings. what is hard for people to remember there are other mediums that can be used to portraiture. I have an interest in photography, especially film photograph.I would choose photographer Annie Libovitz to take my portrait. Her portraits are enigmatic, captivating and classy. Leibovitz knows how to use lighting, filters symmetry, scenery and other assets to her advantage to to form an enthralling portrait.If I had to choose one artist to represent my legacy via art I\u2019d choose artist Benjamin Clementine who is a musician. I would have him write a biographical album chronicling my life I feel his style is very conducive to storytelling and what better than the story to tell than my life. I would have him do lots of strange instrumentation and weird time signatures. I would also have artist howard garner cushing do a very traditional portrait of me for the album art. I\u2019ve always admired his portraits and I\u2019d love to see one of me because I am just so vain._________Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Fanned Flames With Twitter, Which Faces a Blowback", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Fires need fuel. In this era of political rage, a Twitter account that called itself the unofficial voice of Tennessee Republicans provided buckets of gasoline.Its pre-election tweets were a bottomless well of inflammatory misinformation: \u201cObama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.\u201d A mysterious explosion in Washington, it said, had killed one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides, raising her \u201cbody count\u201d to six. Another proclaimed, \u201cObama is the founder of ISIS.\u201dThe account, @TEN_GOP, eventually reached more than 130,000 followers \u2014 10 times that of the official state Republican Party\u2019s Twitter handle. It was one of the most popular political voices in Tennessee. But its lies, distortions and endorsements came from the other side of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and disheartening to see how an outside actor can pinpoint areas of division in America and then exploit them,\u201d said Brent Leatherwood, the former executive director of the Tennessee Republican Party. \u201cYou think we\u2019re getting to a better place and then something like this throws a Molotov cocktail into it.\u201dPerhaps no form of communication has ever established itself so quickly and so thoroughly as social media. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information. Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning. They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia.How much damage did those accounts do in the months leading up to the presidential election? No one knows, not even the companies themselves, which are slowly and grudgingly releasing data about what happened. Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy. But for Twitter \u2014 influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful \u2014 the situation is more vexing. Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.Many of Twitter\u2019s users have long been frustrated with the site\u2019s scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment. Twitter\u2019s critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump. Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the president\u2019s Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say we\u2019re all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people,\u201d he said.There are already signs that Twitter\u2019s bottom line is feeling the effects. An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019. Since other parts of social media \u2014 most notably Facebook \u2014 are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.\u201cHate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users,\u201d said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities. \u201cIf you think about why are people alcoholics, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t acknowledge they\u2019re alcoholics.\u201dHe added about Twitter, \u201cIt has never managed to come to grips with harassment.\u201dTwitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year. But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected. Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week. When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad. Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it \u201cinadequate at every level.\u201d He added that Twitter had \u201cfailed to understand how serious this issue is.\u201dOn Tuesday, Twitter said it would \u201cdramatically\u201d increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like. Political ads will be specially marked. Mr. Warner called Twitter\u2019s plan \u201ca good first step.\u201dBut the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc. The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state. It billed itself as the \u201cUnofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans\u201d but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.\u201cWe thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird,\u201d said Mr. Leatherwood. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you abbreviate Tennessee. Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.\u201dThe real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed. \u201cIt was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments,\u201d Mr. Leatherwood said. \u201cIt offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.\u201dSince the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation. He said others had as well. He never heard back.After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trump\u2019s firing of F.B.I. director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, \u201cI love my whiteness. And yours.\u201d@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account,\u201d said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself. \u201cBut it never occurred to me it was the Russians.\u201dTwitter is, as ever, a work in progress. After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, \u201cWe need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Serves Fake News Ads in an Unlikely Place: Fact-Checking Sites", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The headlines are eye-catching. Melania Trump is leaving the White House! Home renovation cable star Joanna Gaines has abandoned her HGTV show and husband Chip Gaines! Televangelist Joel Osteen is leaving his wife!According to an examination by The New York Times, the enticing headlines served as bait to draw readers to fraudulent sites that masqueraded as mainstream news sites, such as People and Vogue.The fake news ads all worked the same way: They would display headlines at the top of the fact-checking sites that, once clicked, took readers to sites that mimicked the logos and page designs of legitimate publications. The fake stories began with headlines and large photos of the celebrities in question, but after a few sentences, they transitioned into an ad for an anti-aging skin cream.The Snopes and PolitiFact ads show how broad the problem of online misinformation can be, said David Letzler, research scientist at Impact Radius, a digital marketing intelligence firm. \u201cEven websites whose mission is to promote accountability can inadvertently wind up getting used by snake oil salesmen,\u201d he said.Google declined to explain the specifics of how the fake news ads appeared on the fact-checking sites. The accounts that advertised on Snopes and PolitiFact were terminated from Google\u2019s ad platform after The Times asked about them, according to a person with knowledge of the sites who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential.\u201cAs always, when we find deceptive ad practices on our platforms we move swiftly to take action, including suspending the advertiser account if appropriate,\u201d Chi Hea Cho, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cIn addition, we give publishers controls so they can block specific types of ads and advertisers.\u201dWhen alerted to the ads promoting untrue stories on their sites, Snopes and PolitiFact said there was little they could do. Google\u2019s AdSense, which is used by web publishers to sell display advertising on their sites, works through automated tools. Often, advertisers are unsure where their ads are running \u2014 sometimes next to inappropriate or offensive content \u2014 and site owners don\u2019t know which ads will appear on their pages.Vinny Green, Snopes\u2019s co-owner and vice president, said it had tried to filter out misleading advertisements from the 150 million ads it displayed on its site last month. But that goes only so far.\u201cWe have little direct oversight or control over what is being done to filter out fake news ads being served on our site,\u201d he said in an email. He added that the online ad ecosystem was complicit in disseminating and profiting off of misinformation, and that \u201cthese ad quality problems are systemic.\u201dAaron Sharockman, executive director of PolitiFact, said it was working with Google to remove the \u201cquestionable text ads\u201d from its site.\u201cThe revenue those advertisements provide is critical to funding a website like ours, but it\u2019s equally important that we do everything we can to make sure the advertisements appearing on our site are not deceptive or intentionally misleading,\u201d he said.But the websites that advertised on Snopes and PolitiFact took a different approach. Those publishers paid Google to promote their content on legitimate websites to draw traffic for an ad pretending to be a news story, often carrying the banner of a mainstream news publication.The ad heralding the untrue story about Mrs. Trump\u2019s decision to leave Washington and the White House appeared at the top of PolitiFact last Friday. The display ad led to a fake Vogue news article claiming that the story was also featured on Yahoo, Vanity Fair and Time, among other publications.On another PolitiFact page, there was another display ad promoting a false story about Mr. Osteen, the leader of Lakewood Church, a Houston-based megachurch, leaving his wife because she had said too much on TV. When clicked, the ad went to a fake Us Weekly page about how Mrs. Osteen was leaving the church to focus on her skin cream company.The publisher of the fake Us Weekly site also bought a Google search ad, so that a query for the headline of the story \u201cSad News For Lakewood Church\u201d linked to that same fake story.Both PolitiFact and Snopes partnered with Facebook last December, after the social network was criticized for abetting the spread of fake news during the 2016 presidential election. Their experiment \u2014 in which viral and popular posts debunked by the fact checkers are marked as \u201cdisputed,\u201d and cannot be promoted in News Feeds \u2014 expanded and became more aggressive in August.David Carroll, an associate professor at the Parsons School of Design who has researched advertising technology and fake news, said Google and Facebook ultimately don\u2019t know enough about their customers \u2014 advertisers \u2014 making it too easy to game the system without serious repercussions.\u201cFor a few bucks, they allow anyone to target anyone else in the world,\u201d Mr. Carroll said. \u201cThe whole ecosystem has been infiltrated, and there is insufficient friction to keep bad actors out of the system.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Linda Qiu from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Katzenberg\u2019s Big Ask: $2 Billion for Short-Form Video Project", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook and went looking for investors, his so-called first round of financing was for $1 million. When Travis Kalanick sought financing for Uber, he persuaded investors to ante up $1.25 million. Reed Hastings of Netflix raised $2.2 million.Jeffrey Katzenberg\u2019s idea of fund-raising is on a very different scale.Mr. Katzenberg, the longtime Hollywood executive and co-founder of DreamWorks Animation, is trying to raise $2 billion for his new television start-up. That is likely to be the largest first round of financing in history for a digital media company that, at least at the moment, is only a concept swirling around in his head.The huge price tag has not stopped virtually every large media and technology company \u2014 Apple, CBS, Disney, Google, Spotify and Verizon among them \u2014 from taking meetings with Mr. Katzenberg. And several Wall Street private equity firms are circling. The Hollywood parlor game of who is going to invest first has already begun. He is looking for big checks.Mr. Katzenberg, 66, is convinced that his new product, called New TV, can upend the format of television for mobile devices. He wants to create the next-generation version of HBO or Netflix, purpose-built for viewing on phones and tablets with short-form content of premium quality \u2014 think of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as if each episode had a narrative arc of 10 minutes.He wants to create big, expensive productions at a cost of $100,000 a minute. (For the sake of comparison, a highly produced minute of programming on YouTube might cost $10,000.) And he wants to attract A-list talent both in front of and behind the camera. That\u2019s one reason the financing ask is so high: Hollywood heavyweights cannot be convinced to do 10-minute video snippets unless they are paid what they are accustomed to being paid.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s hunch about the way a huge swath of consumers will watch television in the future is, in all likelihood, right. The number of teenagers and young adults who have their nose pressed to their mobile devices watching video content is startling. Globally, 72 percent of all video is viewed on a mobile device, according to Ooyala, a video platform provider.The question is whether his idea is ahead of its time. And whether he can find the right business model to support such expensive programing.Mr. Katzenberg is a realist. \u201cWe need $2 billion. That\u2019s a high bar,\u201d he said. And he acknowledges that the financial details still need to be worked out. It\u2019s daunting. He needs to build an instant library of content \u2014 and a big one.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s gamble is being taken seriously because of his long history of success and his provocative thesis about the current television model. \u201cThe design and the architecture of the storytelling fit the business paradigm, not the other way around,\u201d he explained, suggesting that shows were made in the format of a half-hour or an hour for business reasons and do not make sense in the world of mobile devices and streaming.He also took a shot at all the advertising on network programs. \u201cI would actually make the argument that one of the challenges for network TV has been that they\u2019ve actually busted the form by asking people to watch 19 minutes of commercial time inside of 60 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-two percent of your watch time is watching commercials.\u201dInstead, Mr. Katzenberg is hoping to create a premium network that will probably rely on a combination of subscription fees and advertising \u2014 \u00e0 la Spotify. He does not believe he will put television companies out of business; in fact, he needs them as partners and believes they can live side by side.But Mr. Katzenberg does not want to simply create a studio that specializes in short-form storytelling; he wants to create a platform for it. He is hoping that many of the big television networks both invest and produce content for the service.\u201cThis is literally a true moment in time here in which we\u2019re going to create a new form, a new format, a new platform, new content and we\u2019re going to supply that content and we\u2019re going to let them,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg said of the big networks, \u201cgrab what ultimately will be the biggest value here by owning the platform.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve all grown up with this idea that content is king,\u201d he said, explaining his rationale for trying to create a new service rather than simply creating the content itself. \u201cAnd I realized, it actually isn\u2019t. Content is the king maker, it\u2019s not the king. The king is the platform. HBO is the king. Netflix is the king. Spotify is the king.\u201dWhen I mentioned to Mr. Katzenberg that well-heeled competitors like Apple and Facebook are getting into the television business and may seek to innovate the form, he was unfazed.\u201cThis idea that Apple and Facebook and YouTube are now coming into Hollywood with these billions of dollars and are in fact going to change the enterprise of television is actually wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything new or different or unique. It simply broadens the offering and it may broaden the destinations that you can go to, but in fact that fragmentation at some point is going to implode.\u201dMr. Katzenberg believes he is offering something that will start the next leg of growth in the industry.Executives who have seen Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s plan, including Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, and Leslie Moonves of CBS, have expressed enthusiasm for the project.Still, there are skeptics. Several media executives pointed to Nielsen data showing that traditional television still accounts for the bulk of the video viewing among people over 18 years old in the United States. (The country is far behind other nations in video mobile viewing.)And of course there is the question of what kind of content consumers want to watch on a phone. So far, most short-form content has been relatively cheap to produce, because of lower production quality, and customers have willingly watched it. Who\u2019s to say they are craving HBO-level production quality? And many viewers are happy to watch Netflix on a mobile device and press pause on their favorite show or movie and return to it later.But Mr. Katzenberg says that to think about it like that is backward. There is always an opportunity to create a premium product, he said, and there will be \u201ca pretty meaningful subset of people who would actually pay for it.\u201dTo Mr. Katzenberg, the idea is too obvious not to pursue. \u201cYou have an installed base of one and a half billion people who watch 45 minutes of video on a smartphone every day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is where I say to you, \u2018They\u2019re drinking water. We\u2019re going to give it to them in a bottle.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

(A standard American infantry soldier's magazine is 30 rounds.)AR-15-style rifles are a civilian variant of a standard service rifle used by the American military for more than a half-century. Unlike the military versions, they support only semiautomatic fire.Two of the rifles were outfitted with medium-magnification scopes and two-legged supports, known as bipods, attached to the undersides of the weapons. These additions would have helped Mr. Paddock target specific individuals.StairwellHallwayCartEntranceGunman\u2019shotel suiteRifleDoorLuggageBodyRiflesBroken windowHigh-capacitymagazinesBroken windowDirection ofconcert venueStairwellHallwayCartEntranceGunman\u2019shotel suiteRifleDoorLuggageBodyRiflesBrokenwindowHigh-capacitymagazinesBrokenwindow Direction ofconcert venueGunman\u2019shotel suiteHallwayStairwellEntranceDoorLuggageRiflesBodyBrokenwindowBrokenwindowConcert venueMr. Paddock brought at least 10 suitcases into his hotel suite over a period of time, the police said.

{"Headline": "My Smartphone Died, and I Didn\u2019t Miss It. Well, Maybe a Little.", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseTwo weeks ago, my smartphone shut down because of a low battery as I was about to board a flight to Europe. That seemed odd, given that I had barely used it that day. I plugged it in on the plane, but seven hours later, it still wasn\u2019t functioning. When I arrived at my hotel I tried a different charger, to no avail. The phone was dead \u2014 terminally so, it turned out.I hadn\u2019t brought a laptop, so I had no access to the internet or email. I had no camera, no guidebooks, no maps.For the next 10 days I lived without my phone or any other connection to the digital world. There were indeed many compensations. But it was hard to shake a free-floating anxiety that some disaster loomed. (How would I retrieve my return flight reservations from a nonworking cellphone?)Lately the big internet companies have come under a barrage of criticism for invading privacy, carrying fake news, spreading hate messages (and selling ads against them) and undermining American democracy. What I learned is that, for better or worse, they have already so changed the world that life without them is all but impossible outside a monastery.Road maps, a mainstay of my pre-cellphone trips to Europe, were nowhere to be found, nor were the bookstores that used to sell them. The rental car agency in Milan offered a guide for getting out of the airport, but that was about it. Everyone assumes you have access to Google Maps.Once you\u2019re off the major highways, Italian roads are a spider web connected by roundabouts, bristling with signs pointing to the nearest tiny villages but lacking any route numbers.The tried-and-true method of asking for directions prompted some human interaction and gave my traveling companion the opportunity to practice his Italian. But it was a reminder that human beings are often unreliable. The rental car agent in Milan gave us directions to Siena via Genoa, a route, we later learned, that added about two hours to the trip.Trying to find a house in the Tuscan countryside by asking passers-by was futile. No one in rural Italy seems to use street addresses, which, in any event, don\u2019t correspond in any rational way to actual streets.Living in the moment isn\u2019t so great when you\u2019re lost.While I had no phone of my own, others with me had theirs, and I had to rely on them on several occasions, starting with simply finding our house. We had to call the housekeeper for directions (three times).After that, I relied on borrowed phones, and we used Google Maps for navigation.I shared my experience this week with Adam Alter, an associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and author of \u201cIrresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.\u201d\u201cOne problem for people who choose to be without phones is, as you found, that people expect you to have one, and infrastructure is designed with the knowledge that almost everyone does,\u201d Mr. Alter said. \u201cYou\u2019re borderline forced to carry one for basic utility even if you\u2019d prefer not to.\u201dWithout access to texts or email, I couldn\u2019t see or respond to any messages, no matter how important. I waited three days before breaking down and (again) borrowing a cellphone to check email. But to gain access to my email from an unfamiliar device required a code sent via text to \u2014 where else? \u2014 my dead cellphone.Once I gave that up, I was fine, perhaps because I didn\u2019t feel any guilt \u2014 it wasn\u2019t my fault the phone failed and I couldn\u2019t check messages. For others, this may be difficult: Mr. Alter\u2019s book reports that checking emails has become a widespread addiction.At first I missed my phone\u2019s camera feature. I was on holiday in a beautiful country, after all. But after a few days I stopped thinking about documenting the trip and simply enjoyed it.Without internet access, I had no access to travel mainstays like TripAdvisor or OpenTable. But there were some old guidebooks at the house where we stayed, and major historic sites, tourist attractions and even restaurants don\u2019t change much in a place like Italy.I found it\u2019s not hard to sniff out a promising restaurant that appeals to your personal taste, as opposed to crowdsourced recommendations. We made some wonderful discoveries. And afterward there were no emails asking me to review the experience (and provide sites like TripAdvisor with free editorial copy).Mr. Alter pointed out that \u201cthis sort of serendipity is often the route to novel, exciting, trip-making experiences.\u201dHe added, \u201cPhones overschedule and over regiment our lives, which robs us of these opportunities.\u201dI quickly grew accustomed to having no news, stock market quotes or weather forecasts. I\u2019d never want to live permanently without them, but checking out for 10 days was therapeutic.I read nothing about Donald Trump.Still, I broke down midweek when the housekeeper asked me what I knew about Harvey Weinstein. The accusations of the movie producer\u2019s serial sexual misconduct had broken the day after I left, and were now blanketing Italian media. I knew nothing. So I borrowed a phone and read The New York Times account and then The New Yorker piece that followed. Both were riveting but interfered with what had, until then, been blissfully untroubled sleep.After returning the rental car in Milan, I realized that no phone meant no Uber app. That meant we did a lot of walking in what turns out to be a fascinating city. And my anxieties about my return trip proved unfounded. I skipped the check-in kiosks at the airport, went to the check-in counter and got an old-fashioned paper boarding pass with minimum fuss.I\u2019d never leave home without a working smartphone again. But denied access to the internet, I had time to read several books. I focused more on the people with me and the beauty of my surroundings. I was more open to unplanned experiences. I had time for self-reflection. I\u2019d like to think that, on future trips, I\u2019d use the phone only when essential.It turns out there\u2019s an app to help people do that.\u201cRecently, I spent two weeks in a place without cellphone coverage and had a similar experience to you,\u201d Mr. Holesh told me. \u201cIt was really inconvenient not to have Maps, but refreshing to not constantly be worrying about what\u2019s going on.\u201cIt was literally the longest stretch of time I\u2019ve not accessed the internet in 15 years,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe first few days were tough, but after that, I got used to the lack of connectivity and loved it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Book the Cheapest Holiday Travel", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravel TipsIf you\u2019re looking to save some money this holiday season, data researchers have gotten pretty good at determining the best times to book air travel \u2014 as well as when to fly. Yet there is not one rule of thumb to follow when trying to make cost-effective holiday travel plans.For example, booking your air travel for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays too early can be really expensive, but waiting too long can be just as financially painful. Confused yet?Not to worry. The following are answers to the questions you should be asking yourself as you look to finalize your holiday travels.For Thanksgiving travel, you\u2019re in friendly booking territory during the month of October. But make sure you have Halloween circled on your calendar if you want to lock in the lowest fares. You\u2019ll start to see prices climb slowly beginning in November, and then more so as the month progresses.If you\u2019re traveling around the Christmas holiday season, the window for the lowest airfare has already closed (the first week of October). But you\u2019ll want to book before you hit about 10 days out from Christmas Day, Mr. Surry said.\u201cBased on Hopper\u2019s historical data, the best time to book Christmas flights is about 83 days before departure, which is the first week of October. Prices begin rising by about $4 per day around Thanksgiving, and then by about $7 per day in the final two weeks,\u201d Mr. Surry said.But there might not be a whole lot to gain from focusing on the day of the week.\u201cPricing is extremely nuanced,\u201d Mr. Surry said. \u201cEveryone wants a golden rule about when to buy, but it really depends on your route, dates and demand.\u201dYes, this one you\u2019ll want to think about carefully, and also ask yourself: How flexible is my holiday travel?\u201cIf you have flexibility, in general it will pay to extend your trip,\u201d Mr. Surry said.Yes, data for domestic flights show that some destination cities are more expensive to travel to than others, which can be tied to demand.Priceline.com found that the most popular travel route for both Thanksgiving and Christmas is New York City to Florida (Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando). For Christmas travel, these destination cities are also among the ones with the highest \u201choliday premium,\u201d as Hopper terms it, meaning the greatest increase in price compared to non-holiday travel.No matter where you are traveling from for the Christmas holiday, you can expect to pay up to 82 percent more for a fare to Miami ($383 instead of $211), according to Hopper. Fort Lauderdale and Orlando see spikes of over 60 percent.For Thanksgiving, you can expect to spend 40 percent more than usual for trips to Denver and Boston.There are ways to help protect yourself from the fluctuating holiday travel marketplace.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At BuzzFeed, a Pivot to Movies and Television", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "Matthew Henick, a onetime teenage ringtone magnate, is leading the company away from popular shorts toward deals with production studios.Supported byHOLLYWOOD \u2014 On an October morning, Matthew Henick, the head of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, maneuvered his black Lexus S.U.V. through thick Los Angeles traffic from his home in Silver Lake toward BuzzFeed\u2019s new campus, still under construction, in Hollywood.\u201cThis is actually the first time I\u2019m driving to the new building from my house, so we\u2019re really testing my commute,\u201d he said.Eighteen months after BuzzFeed blew up a watermelon on Facebook Live before 800,000 viewers, the company has leased buildings on a quiet block west of Highland Avenue as it prepares to focus on creating full-length movies and television series.With his shoulder-length, Troy Polamalu-esque hair still damp from a morning shower, Mr. Henick, 34, strode through a maze of soundstages and editing suites. It wasn\u2019t quite the Paramount lot, but neither did it look like a space for some digital start-up intent on creating viral videos on the cheap.\u201cIt\u2019s a much better place, especially for my team,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cIt feels a little bit more like a grown-up office, for lack of a better term.\u201dThese days Mr. Henick and his team of 42 people concentrate their energies on mining BuzzFeed articles, lists and video shorts for ideas that may be spun into feature-length movies or television series.\u201cI\u2019ll have to go out there for a good chunk of time if the movie gets made, which may not time well with the baby,\u201d Mr. Henick said.Mr. Henick grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., and spent his childhood riding forklifts around his father\u2019s floor-covering business at a warehouse in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg neighborhood that has since been converted into an apartment building. His interest in media and technology began early.When he was 14, he and his best friend created an MP3 website that drew a cease-and-desist letter from the Recording Industry Association of America because it hosted the \u201cTitanic\u201d soundtrack.Several years later, Mr. Henick and his friend started one of the first ringtone sites in the United States. They bought the domain name NokiaUSA.net in the hope that Nokia customers would stumble on their site. Nokia was not pleased \u2014 it served the teenagers a cease-and-desist letter in the halls of their high school, after which they changed the company\u2019s name to MobileSmarts. The business, Mr. Henick said, made a lot of money, although he wouldn\u2019t specify how much.\u201cHe\u2019s an entrepreneur who knows how to build new things and new companies,\u201d Jonah Peretti, the founder and chief executive of BuzzFeed, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m always amazed at the way he\u2019s able to switch between these different models in his head and see the same things through a totally different lens.\u201dMr. Henick\u2019s experience as a teenage ringtone magnate gave him the idea to go west for college. \u201cI was sort of already on that trajectory of wanting to head at least somewhere close to Silicon Valley, to figure out what was going on there,\u201d he said.\u201cThe professor would want to talk to us about LiveJournal and Myspace to a certain extent, and the students in the class would raise their hand and say, \u2018Well, what do you think about Facebook?\u2019\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t even know about it.\u201dFrom there, Mr. Henick studied producing at the University of Southern California\u2019s film school in Los Angeles. During summer break, he attended a talk at the Skirball Cultural Center by the comedy producer Judd Apatow.\u201cI just went up to him and told him as much of my story as I could,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cWe were both from Long Island, both went to U.S.C., and I was looking for a gig.\u201dMr. Apatow brought him on as an intern before hiring him as an assistant, so Mr. Henick spent his second year at U.S.C. balancing classes with reading scripts and checking out sets. After graduation, he worked on movies like \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d and \u201cStep Brothers\u201d before going out on his own as a writer, script doctor and start-up consultant.Along the way, he and Ms. Killoch, who met at U.S.C., started a clothing company. They also got married.\u201cI clearly get bored very easily, because I do too many things,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cI was literally sitting in my apartment writing movies, doing all right \u2014 that\u2019s sort of the dream for some people \u2014 and I was like, \u2018What else can I be doing?\u2019\u201dBefore Mr. Henick started at BuzzFeed, he was worried that he might end up restless yet again. But so far, he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been bored once.\u201dDuring Mr. Henick\u2019s tenure, many digital media companies that once raked in millions of investment dollars found themselves struggling. A so-called pivot to video \u2014 a term sometimes used to cover layoffs of text-oriented staff members \u2014 swept the industry. Increasingly wary of the outsize influence of Facebook and Google \u2014 and hoping to siphon away some of the billions of advertising dollars still devoted to television \u2014 new media companies rediscovered old media, setting off a race into TV and film.Cue Mr. Henick.His mission is to help diversify BuzzFeed\u2019s revenue stream: Executives expect that partnerships with production studios may bring in a third of the company\u2019s revenue in the coming years.\u201cI don\u2019t think we do anything specifically for that reason, but it\u2019s always a byproduct,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cIf our business is stronger and it\u2019s growing exponentially because we keep finding brand-new businesses to get into, it\u2019s going to allow us to hopefully go public or invest in a lot more stuff elsewhere in the company.\u201dDuring a weekly check-in meeting at the old BuzzFeed lot on Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Henick swiveled around on his desk chair, a hand under his chin. He wore jeans, a light blue button-down and retro Air Jordan sneakers. Staff members talked about projects or possible deals with Netflix, MTV and Facebook.Mr. Henick\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cI would retire out on top,\u201d he said, \u201cif we could get Sorkin to write it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It would be called Hack Temple.\u201cWe had so many concerns from our investors saying this would be inappropriate and we should change it,\u201d said Mr. Cherkashin, 44, who planned to officially open Hack Temple this fall. \u201cA bunch of Russian guys opening a hacker temple in the middle of San Francisco at a time when Russian hackers are considered the most evil in the world. They say you can\u2019t.\u201dAt the same time, many said that as Russia gained a reputation for its hackers, interest in hiring its tech talent was increasing.Now when Mr. Cherkashin, a partner at GVA Capital, which is investing $120 million in start-ups, pitches companies on why they should take investments from him, he gets skeptical questions as soon as they hear his accent, he said.\u201cIt feels like if you\u2019re a politician and you fell into a sex scandal, and everybody knows you for this, and every time someone recognizes you they have this smile on their face, \u2018So how\u2019s your personal life doing?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Cherkashin, whose firm was incorporated in the United States.\u201cThis is how I feel every time I meet with an investor and they hear my Russian accent,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have this smile on their face.\u201dProspective partners and start-ups invariably ask the same question, Mr. Cherkashin said: Is his money clean?\u201cThis question comes up two or three times a day,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people would ask this question to a manager from another region.\u201dJulian Zegelman, an entrepreneur and a lawyer who represents and invests in Russian-speaking founders, said potential local tech partners worried they would accidentally get into business with the Russian government.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be invested or dealing with companies whose technical talent is captive in Russia,\u201d he said.Mr. Zegelman said he had noticed that some cybersecurity firms, big tech companies, government customers and large venture capital firms were the most wary about working with new Russian immigrants. Yet some start-ups and small investment firms are more interested in Russian talent now.\u201cIf you would have asked 10 years ago what Russia was known for, it would be Putin, the oligarchs and oil,\u201d he said, referring to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cNow when you ask folks, \u2018What do you think about Russia?\u2019 you get things back like: \u2018Oh, great cryptography.\u2019 \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a lot of talented engineers.\u2019\u201dLeonard Grayver, a lawyer specializing in start-ups who is on the board of the American Business Association of Russian-Speaking Professionals, said the hacking had put Russian tech talent at \u201cthe forefront.\u201d His firm brokers technology deals between Russia and Silicon Valley, handling tech licensing and talent acquisitions, and he said the average size of a deal had risen to $4 million this year, from $1 million to $2 million last year.And as companies staff up with Russian talent, he is getting a new question that he finds bizarre: \u201cAre we letting the wolf in the henhouse? \u201d Some companies have asked him to help arrange for heightened internal security, he added.\u201cA lot of clients are trying to find ways to hire those Russian hackers and at the same time instituting heightened security protocols internally,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re isolating source code so you don\u2019t have access to the main tree.\u201dWhen young Russian technologists first arrive in San Francisco, the person they often text is the investor Nicholas Davidov. Mr. Davidov, 30, said he was part of what he called the New Wave, which is a group of Russian founders and engineers who came over to Silicon Valley in the last few years. They gather at a Russian immigrant-owned bar in San Francisco, Rum & Sugar, and every Wednesday at a smoke shop in Redwood City, Calif., where they share stories.Most of the comments that Mr. Davidov and his friends now get are couched as jokes, he said.\u201cSomebody announced me on one of the conferences where I was speaking and said, \u2018I invited Nick because I wanted to collude with Russians,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cJust a lot of jokes.\u201dMr. Davidov is an investor in Wallarm, a cybersecurity firm based in San Francisco. He attributes Wallarm\u2019s double-digit growth this year directly to the peculiar reputation that has come from the election-influence campaign and the fact that the company\u2019s founders are Russian.Ivan Novikov, 29, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wallarm, was less enthusiastic about how news of Russian interference in the election has affected his life.\u201cTechnically, any Russian who works in I.T. is a hacker, so we\u2019re all \u2018Russian hackers,\u2019 and a lot of people like to mention it, but it\u2019s not so funny when it\u2019s 10 times per day or 10 times per party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t like this hype about it.\u201dSome Russian-born entrepreneurs said they had noticed no change in how they were treated. Stanislav Shalunov, a co-founder of Open Garden, which develops peer-to-peer mesh networking software, said he hadn\u2019t experienced anything different.\u201cWith all this hacking news, I don\u2019t think anyone alleges anyone from the Russian tech community in the U.S. is engaged in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty obvious that lots of people from Russia are getting hired.\u201dBack at what may only briefly be known as the Hack Temple (investors want a new name before it officially opens), two young Russian entrepreneurs made breakfast sandwiches in the rectory kitchen one morning last week. The building has eight bedrooms, some with bunks to fit up to four; a living room full of Midcentury Modern sofas; and a patio covered in artificial turf and often used for beer pong. Before Mr. Cherkashin bought the building in January 2016, it was Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe Church.In the cavernous nave, the stained-glass saints were covered in gauzy panels to soften the religious feel. Volunteers have fixed the broken organ so it plays again, now for parties.\u201cIf there would be a city in the world where you can go to church and a hackers\u2019 house,\u201d Mr. Cherkashin said, \u201cit would only be this one.\u201dOn the wall along one of the aisles, Evgeniy Lapchenko, the Ukrainian artist, has remade Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s \u201cGarden of Earthly Delights.\u201d Among the twisted human figures are tech luminaries: the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs taking a selfie, revelers at Burning Man and Mr. Brin of Google in a self-driving car.As for rebranding Hack Temple, Mr. Cherkashin hasn\u2019t found a new name he likes.\u201cIt can be called the Start-Up Temple,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just too boring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cisco and Google Find Mutual Interest in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google and Cisco Systems, two trendsetters in different eras of the internet, are joining forces as the growth of cloud computing puts new pressure on big tech companies and leads to strange corporate bedfellows.The Silicon Valley giants on Wednesday announced a collaboration to help companies manage software and technology services that may run in their own data centers or in facilities operated by external cloud services.Google, the largest unit of its parent, Alphabet, hopes to benefit from Cisco\u2019s close ties to corporate customers as the search engine giant tries to catch up to Amazon, the market leader in cloud services, and Microsoft.Cisco could also use some help. The tech giant, which in 2000 briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company when its computer networking equipment was used to build the internet, faces a serious threat from cloud services. Companies that once spent heavily on new hardware from Cisco and other suppliers increasingly rent cloud services instead, with companies like Amazon doing most of the heavy lifting in the background.\u201cEvery company that built an empire on selling equipment to companies to put in their data centers is feeling incredible pressure,\u201d said Dave Bartoletti, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, a market research firm.Cisco has also faced stiffening competition from rivals like the software maker VMware, which announced a partnership with Amazon last year.Cisco and Google executives vowed to offer something different. They said companies have been struggling with the fact that they need separate tools to manage software on their own premises and those running in the cloud, a situation that sometimes causes security problems. By combining Google programming technology and Cisco networking and security software, they said, tech managers can create and manage software that can run securely in or outside their companies\u2019 data centers.The idea, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google\u2019s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, is to close those \u201csecurity gaps.\u201dGoogle has moved aggressively to catch up. In late 2015, the company gave the job of running its cloud business to Diane Greene, a widely respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped make VMware\u2019s technology a mainstay at many corporations.She made a series of organizational changes, recruited new talent and introduced new technology features. In one important move, Google in September 2016 bought the start-up Apigee Corporation for $625 million, adding capabilities to help customers connect their operations with online services operated by others.So has Cisco. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., promoted a concept called \u201cintercloud\u201d that amounted to coordinating a federation of cloud services operated by partners.But Cisco dropped that approach last year, choosing instead to help customers manage \u201chybrid\u201d cloud arrangements \u2014 industry parlance for using a blend of operations in a company\u2019s own data centers and those operated by a growing number of cloud services.\u201cWe think we are one of the few companies that can navigate this multi-cloud world,\u201d said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Cisco\u2019s networking and security business.The company has broadly signaled plans to rely more on software and services than on sales of networking hardware, aided frequently by acquisitions. On Monday, for example, Cisco said it would pay $1.9 billion for BroadSoft, which sells online communications services.Other companies also have embraced the hybrid cloud concept. Microsoft, for example, has longtime ties with corporate software buyers and has come up with ways to run new cloud applications in its data centers or on customers\u2019 premises, said Al Gillen, an analyst at the research firm IDC.\u201cWe see other vendors doing things to compete since what we have is so strong and so unique,\u201d said Julia White, a corporate vice president with Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business.VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, was first known for software technology called virtualization that allows more efficient use of servers but now competes with Cisco with networking software. Russ Currie, a vice president of enterprise strategy at the network monitoring specialist NetScout Systems, said VMware was effectively using its cloud alliance with A.W.S. to court customers. Pat Gelsinger, VMware\u2019s chief executive, called the announcement from Google and Cisco a \u201cvalidation\u201d of his own company\u2019s vision.Cisco also cooperates in various ways with A.W.S. and Microsoft in cloud computing. But Mr. Goeckeler said that the Google relationship was particularly potent because of the technological specialties of each company.\u201cWe are both users of each other\u2019s products,\u201d said Mr. H\u00f6lzle of Google. But in this case, this is about working together to give their customers the technology they want, he said.Advertisement"}

Trump clinched the presidency.\u201cAll this tough talk about immigrants got me thinking I still could be deported,\u201d said Mr. Bernal, 49, a truck driver who left El Salvador in 1990 and has two teenage children. \u201cYou never know.\u201dLast week, he was among 3,542 immigrants who raised their right hands to take the oath at a naturalization ceremony inside the Los Angeles Convention Center, joining a growing wave of new citizens across the country.And with an unrelenting stream of hard-line rhetoric and enforcement in the news, as well as a swell of citizenship drives and advocacy, there are no signs the trend is abating.\u201cThe draw of U.S. citizenship becomes more powerful when you have the political and policy environment that you have right now,\u201d said Rosalind Gold, senior policy director at the Naleo Educational Fund, a national bipartisan Latino group.About 8.8 million people are eligible to become American citizens, meaning they have been lawful permanent residents, or had a green card, for at least five years.In the first three quarters of the 2017 fiscal year \u2014 from Oct. 1, 2016, through June 30, the latest period for which data is available \u2014 783,330 people filed applications, compared with the 725,925 who filed during the same months a year earlier. The current figure is well on pace to surpass the 971,242 who applied in the 2016 fiscal year.With the surge of applications, the processing backlog has ballooned. There were 708,638 pending applications at the end of June, a steady rise from 522,565 at the end of the 2016 fiscal year and 291,833 in 2010. The average wait time has doubled, to 8.6 months from four months a few years ago, with applicants in cities like Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas and Miami waiting a year or longer.The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processes the applications, said it was enlisting officers to work overtime and seeking to fill vacancies, noting \u201cthere is no quick fix\u201d for the delays.But the current political climate is compelling many to look past any deterrents.Permanent residency can be revoked, and green card holders can be deported if they are convicted on charges such as aggravated felonies, drug trafficking and crimes of \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d which can be broadly defined. Each time a permanent resident leaves the United States, re-entry is at the discretion of an immigration official.Citizenship protects immigrants from deportation if they commit a crime, and gives them access to federal benefits and jobs that are restricted to citizens.Ahead of the presidential election last year, several nonprofits began campaigns to encourage citizenship and guide immigrants through the application process, an effort that has not let up. Many cities, including Miami, Portland and Salt Lake City, have unveiled naturalization drives this year, and adult-education programs have added free citizenship courses for applicants.On a recent Saturday, the line for a workshop in Houston began forming at 3:30 a.m. Among the 100 attendees were Isidra Moreno, 72, a green card holder for 20 years, and Isabel Sanchez, 28, who has had one since she was a child.\u201cWe immigrants are feeling threatened,\u201d said Ms. Moreno in Spanish. She said she was concerned after watching on the news that laws could change, which she feared would undermine her right to remain in the country with her two American daughters.Ms. Sanchez said that she decided to naturalize after applying for a job at a call center, only to be told after passing several steps in the interview process that she did not qualify because she was not a citizen. \u201cI walked out in tears,\u201d said Ms. Sanchez, \u201cand Googled how to become a U.S. citizen.\u201dThe electoral implications of the rise in citizenship applications are unclear. In states like California, which leans heavily Democratic, tens of thousands of new citizens, and newly minted voters, will not change the status quo. In other states, like Florida, many new citizens are Cubans and South Americans who tend to support the Republican Party.Mexicans make up the largest share of green card holders, and Mexican consulates have received a flood of inquiries about the implications of holding dual citizenship.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen anti-immigrant legislation motivate eligible immigrants to naturalize before and now we\u2019re seeing this again at both the state and national level,\u201d said Emily Gelbaum, chief of staff of the National Partnership for New Americans.A 1994 ballot initiative in California to block undocumented immigrants from certain public services is credited with mobilizing over one million new Latino voters and moving the state to the Democratic column. Hispanic citizenship soared in the aftermath of the measure, Proposition 187.\u201cIn Texas, we\u2019re seeing unprecedented interest in naturalization, including from green card holders who have lived in the state for decades,\u201d Ms. Gelbaum said.But Latinos in the state, whose voting potential is often characterized as a sleeping giant, have been less politically engaged and less likely to acquire citizenship than Latinos in other states.\u201cFor a half-century we have been waiting for the moment that would galvanize Texas Latinos to seek citizenship, register to vote and storm the polls,\u201d said Cal Jillson, a political-science professor at Southern Methodist University. \u201cMaybe this one will do it. I\u2019m not betting on it.\u201dIn Los Angeles, immigrants streamed into the massive hall for the naturalization ceremony, most of them dressed in formal or festive attire and accompanied by family and friends.Alejandra Ruiz, 35, who is from Mexico and applied in February, arrived with her two children and American husband, Armando. \u201cI encouraged her to become a citizen because of all the stuff going on with politics,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said. \u201cShe was already a resident but it felt like she wasn\u2019t safe.\u201dSeated in the front row was Catalina Morales, 51, with her daughter, Araceli, 26, an American who serves in the military.After 30 years as a green card holder, \u201cshe felt her residency was at risk,\u201d Araceli Morales said of her Mexican mother. \u201cIt was mostly because of Trump.\u201dAlso there was Alma Dominguez, 43, who attended night school twice a week for three months to prepare for the civics test. \u201cOut of all the negativity, something positive is happening,\u201d she said, scanning the crowd of immigrants.The largest number of new citizens hailed from Mexico, the Philippines and China, but those present had come from more than 120 countries.\u201cIt\u2019s the right time now\u201d to become a citizen, said Mona Wattar from Lebanon, who obtained a green card 10 years ago. Ton Gao, a Chinese immigrant who donned a red polo shirt, blue training paints and white sneakers, said, \u201cI did it for freedom.\u201dSeveral rows back sat Mr. Bernal, the truck driver from El Salvador, an American flag tucked in his pocket. Hand over heart, he joined his fellow new citizens for the Pledge of Allegiance to a huge flag that hung from the ceiling.At the end of the ceremony, he collected his naturalization certificate and headed toward the exit to meet his wife, Eloisa, and children, Janie and Marcell, for a celebratory lunch.But first he stopped at a voter registration table. \u201cI got everything done,\u201d Mr. Bernal said. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to vote.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Would That Couch Look at Home? Check Your Phone", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is not unusual to order a piece of furniture and realize, once it arrives, that it is completely wrong for your room. A red couch that looked amazing in the showroom may turn out to overwhelm your small space. And the last thing you want to do is invest in a heavy piece of furniture you have to pay to return.To help visualize that couch in your living room, furniture sellers and interior design firms have been rolling out new apps and online programs that allow you to try furniture at home using virtual and augmented reality.The new tools generally come in three flavors: 3-D features that enable you to virtually place furnishings in your room using the camera on your cellphone; styling apps that let you snap a picture of your space, clear it of all furniture and drop in new options as you shop online; and interior decorating services that do it all for you, selecting furnishings on your behalf and creating 3-D renderings of your room from photos you provide.To see how well they really work, I tried out a few from the comfort of my bedroom and living room \u2014 both of which need a refresh, if not an entirely new look. Some were trickier to use than others, but each one offers a glimpse at the future of online furniture shopping and interior design.For $69 per room, this online interior design service offers two surprisingly lifelike 3-D renderings of your space. The process is easy. You provide feedback on the room you want to design, including a rough budget, and take a quiz to help determine your style, selecting photos of rooms you are drawn to. (Because Modsy is an online software program, you can use your cellphone or computer.)Then, you snap eight photos of your room (one from each corner, and one from each wall) and upload to Modsy. In 10 days or less, you receive an email indicating your renderings are waiting for you in your Modsy account. If you like an item in your room, you can add it to a shopping cart. A personal shopping service coordinates shipping and delivery, ensuring that you have to enter your address and credit card only once.The style quiz, which determined I was a \u201cmod enthusiast,\u201d was fairly spot on: \u201cYou go for Danish Modern design and streamlined furniture, but incorporating some traditional pieces for comfort strikes the perfect balance.\u201dThe 3-D renderings I received were not only surprisingly realistic, but also fun to explore, showing each room outfitted with two sets of new furniture to scale and presented at various angles, including top-down and 360 views. And while a few pieces of furniture were not my first choice, most of it appealed to me.The first bedroom design had a similar layout to my current setup, replacing my simple teak bedroom set with a Tate upholstered bed (from Crate & Barrel) and Culla night stands (from Article) for a \u201csoft midcentury look,\u201d according to Modsy\u2019s design description, which was emailed to me when the renderings were finished. A Marbled wool rug (from West Elm) anchored the space while an Aspect walnut desk (from Crate & Barrel) was paired with a deep blue Helvetica chair (from West Elm).The second design, which was bolder with richer blue and white tones, flipped the bed to the other side of the room \u2014 a layout I had never considered but now would consider trying \u2014 replaced the desk with a dresser, reading nook and added a Dowel mirror (from West Elm).The few hiccups I encountered were easily resolved by tapping on a service bell icon for help with my design and dashing off a note about my issues: a couple of items, including a table lamp I was interested in, were not itemized in my list of products to buy; and I was not in love with the sectional that Modsy suggested for my living room or the art on the wall.For $199, you can get unlimited revisions and access to a Modsy designer via phone, chat or video. I opted for the cheaper version, which allows for one revised design per room and unlimited use of the \u201cstyle editor,\u201d which allows you to swap products and adjust layouts yourself.While using the bell service was a breeze, I found the \u201cstyle editor\u201d a bit clunky. It was not available on my phone. And when I tried to swap out a piece of art in my living room design using my laptop, I encountered a glitch that did not allow me to scroll down to see more options. As a result, I could access only a handful of alternative artworks, none of which appealed to me.Jacqui Wimberly, a Modsy publicist, pointed out that the style editor is an experiment. \u201cThere was such a high demand from customers to be able to make changes on their own that Modsy decided to release it in the beta state while they continue to work on a full-fledged editing feature,\u201d she said.In the end it didn\u2019t matter, as the Modsy designer I reached via the service bell icon was willing to swap it out for me.If you would rather create your own renderings for free, Hutch may be the app for you. Hutch, which debuted this year for iPhone and Android users, lets you be the designer by snapping a photo of your room and decorating in 2-D.Within an hour of submitting a photo of your room, Hutch virtually clears out all furniture, children\u2019s toys and clutter so you can fill it with furniture sold via the app. You can create your own look by selecting from furniture and accessories sold by Hutch\u2019s partners or choose from a list of completed designs called \u201cfilters\u201d to superimpose a specific look onto your room, complete with a price list of the furniture used.Don\u2019t like the Deco Inlay nightstand (from Anthropologie) under the \u201cflea market finds\u201d filter? You can easily swap it out with a Marotta end table (from Wayfair). Tapping an item sends you to the seller\u2019s website to find dimensions or to buy.While the filters were easy and fun to play with, I was disappointed by the lack of options when trying to create my own look. Though I was designing a living room and bedroom, there were no options to customize other spaces like a dining area, children\u2019s bedroom or playroom. And while I wanted to put a TV console under the window in my living room, the only categories available were sofas, coffee tables, lamps, art, curtains and rods, bouquets, and side tables.A few of the categories, including side tables, table lamps and chairs, only offered one option: sold by Hutch, all of which were out of stock. And for nontraditional spaces, you may have to use your imagination or try a couple of different angles before you find a filter that fits your layout.Beatrice Fischel-Bock, Hutch\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, said more rooms are in the works and that she will have her team look into what must have been a glitch I experienced when personalizing my living room. \u201cWe have thousands of products in the system,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be seeing just one. There should be at least 10 backup options.\u201dBy November, Hutch plans to let you play with layouts to make it easier to design nontraditional spaces.Apple\u2019s latest operating system for iPhones and iPads rolled out on Sept. 19 along with a flurry of new apps that leverage Apple\u2019s new augmented reality development platform. Houzz, the home renovation and design site, was among them, with a new version of its 3-D shopping feature, \u201cView in My Room 3D,\u201d which lets you immediately place three-dimensional images of furniture, for free.Say you are shopping online for a floor lamp for your dining room. A tap of a button below the item lets you view the lamp in your room by accessing your phone\u2019s camera and superimposing a 3-D image of the lamp on the screen.(Ikea, Wayfair and others rolled out similar features in the App Store with Apple\u2019s latest operating system. Wayfair\u2019s version also works on devices supported by Tango, Google\u2019s augmented reality platform.)Houzz\u2019s new version comes with a catalog of 500,000 products in 3-D. It eliminates a quirk of the previous iteration, which required users to pinch and zoom furnishings into place \u2013 an arduous task in my experience, that resulted in inadvertently shrinking items down to the size of a pea whenever I tried to fit them to my space. Now the app eliminates that frustration by automatically sizing images to scale. A new version of \u201cView in My Room 3-D\u201d was released on Sept. 26 for Android users.Seeing the images at scale removes the guesswork involved in figuring out whether that coffee table will actually fit in your cramped living room. You can also now walk up to that coffee table to get a better sense of its texture. Multiple items can be viewed at once on the screen, with each automatically added to a shopping list so you don\u2019t have to leave the app to buy. Just don\u2019t try to virtually hang a ceiling lamp in your room. The app does not yet support ceiling lamps in 3-D.If all you want is to get an idea of how a specific piece of furniture will look in your room, Houzz is a good, fast option. For those who want to play around with different looks, Hutch will help you do that for free. For those of us who want more hand-holding while decorating a room, Modsy is a solid, low-cost alternative to seeing an interior designer in person.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Russia-Linked Ads Came in Many Disguises", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Russians who posed as Americans on Facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises.\u201cWe\u2019re obviously deeply disturbed by this,\u201d Joel Kaplan, Facebook vice president for United States public policy, said in an interview. \u201cThe ads and accounts we found appeared to amplify divisive political issues across the political spectrum,\u201d including gun rights, gay rights issues and the Black Lives Matter movement.The scope and types of the Facebook content being handed over underline the complicated nature of the investigation, and the degree to which the social network \u2014 home to more than two billion regular visitors \u2014 has been used to manipulate Americans and foment public unrest.In a live video address on his Facebook page last month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged the gravity and novelty of the tactics used across his network.\u201cMany of these dynamics were new in this election, or at much larger scale than ever before in history, and at much larger scale than the interference we\u2019ve found,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Since Facebook\u2019s public disclosures, the cross hairs have widened to encompass other companies in Silicon Valley and what part, if any, their networks had in shaping the 2016 election\u2019s outcome.Officials from all three companies have been asked to testify at public congressional hearings on the Russian operations before the House committee this month and the Senate committee on Nov. 1.While American intelligence agencies concluded in January that a major goal of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, was to damage Hillary Clinton, the Facebook operation shows the Russian government reached deeply into polarizing political issues on multiple fronts. Russia experts said Mr. Putin hoped to mar the image of American democracy and handicap the United States\u2019 international influence.In every case, the voices posed as Americans and presumed to speak for like-thinking fellow citizens: anti-immigration zealots, gun-rights advocates, gay rights supporters, African-American activists \u2014 and, more incongruously, dog lovers, according to the two people familiar with the sampling of advertisements.The LGBT United page and a Twitter account called @LGBTuni, featuring a rainbow symbol, declared: \u201cWe speak for all fellow members of LGBT community across the nation. Gender preference does not define you. Your spirit defines you.\u201dThe Defend the 2nd page appeared to have spread messages of support for gun rights.\u201cWhy do I have a gun?\u201d asks a young woman in one image that appears to be associated with the page. \u201cBecause it\u2019s easier for my family to get me out of jail than out of cemetery.\u201d (The image and slogan seem to be borrowed from real gun activists, but the dropped \u201ca\u201d before \u201ccemetery\u201d is a characteristic mistake for Russians speaking English.)Part of Facebook\u2019s challenge in rooting out bad actors speaks to the very nature of how the company\u2019s entire network is built. In some cases, the Russian-linked accounts created Facebook groups and posted images and content aimed to spread quickly across Facebook.To aid the viral spread, these accounts paid for \u201cboosted posts\u201d \u2014 Facebook\u2019s name for one of its paid advertisements \u2014 to appear interspersed in users\u2019 news feeds, the central column filled with status updates and photos from friends. Those posts often included a call to action, like asking users to join a bogus group or share the post.Moreover, the disinformation campaign spread well beyond Facebook to sites like Reddit, Instagram, 4chan and Imgur \u2014 other popular online social networks \u2014 making it more difficult for any one company to curb the tide of fake accounts.The Rev. Heber Brown III, pastor of a Baltimore church, asked Blacktivist if those behind the account were in Baltimore. The person or people behind the account responded that they were not but \u201cwe are looking for friendship, because we are fighting for the same reasons. Actually we are open for your thoughts and offers.\u201dMr. Brown replied that they should \u201ccome learn and listen before you lead\u201d and urged Blacktivist to apologize publicly. When he learned on Friday, first from a CNN report, that the account originated in Russia, Mr. Brown tweeted his amazement that he had not been correcting an overeager out-of-town activist but had unwittingly been \u201cdisrupting a Russian op.\u201dThe goal of the dog lovers\u2019 page was more obscure. But some analysts suggested a possible motive: to build a large following before gradually introducing political content. Without viewing the entire feed from the page, now closed by Facebook, it is impossible to say whether the Russian operators tried such tactics.Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent now at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, said Russia had been entrepreneurial in trying to develop diverse channels of influence. Some, like the dogs page, may have been created without a specific goal and held in reserve for future use.\u201cThey were creating many audiences on social media to try to influence around,\u201d said Mr. Watts, who has traced suspected Russian accounts since 2015.Facebook said it was taking steps to fight back. The company plans to hire more than 1,000 new employees for its ads review team, and said it would cooperate and share what it learned with other technology companies. It also plans to restrict \u201cmore subtle types of violence\u201d from appearing in ads, and will require more thorough documentation to verify the identities of advertisers who wish to buy political ads.On Saturday, at the conclusion of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur \u2014 the \u201cDay of Atonement\u201d \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg, who is Jewish, also appeared penitent.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Scott Shane from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The \u2018Resistance,\u2019 Raising Big Money, Upends Liberal Politics", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It started as a scrappy grass-roots protest movement against President Trump, but now the so-called resistance is attracting six- and seven-figure checks from major liberal donors, posing an insurgent challenge to some of the left\u2019s most venerable institutions \u2014 and the Democratic Party itself.The jockeying between groups, donors and operatives for cash and turf is occurring mostly behind the scenes. But it has grown acrimonious at times, with upstarts complaining they are being boxed out by a liberal establishment that they say enables the sort of Democratic timidity that paved the way for the Trump presidency.Entrenched Democratic groups are facing growing questions about the return on the hundreds of millions of dollars they have spent over the years. Groups affiliated with Mrs. Clinton \u201cspent so much money based on a bad strategy in this last cycle that they should step aside and let others lead in this moment,\u201d said Quentin James, a founder of a political committee called the Collective PAC that supports African-American candidates.While the new groups gained early traction mostly on the strength of grass-roots volunteers and small donations \u2014 and with relatively meager overall budgets \u2014 they are beginning to attract attention from the left\u2019s most generous benefactors.\u201cWe\u2019re in a disruptive period, and when we get through it, the progressive infrastructure landscape may look different,\u201d said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. \u201cThere may be groups that have been around that don\u2019t rise to the challenge, and there may be some new groups that do rise to the challenge, while others fade away.\u201dBut this year, the Democracy Alliance hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama White House official, to help the new anti-Trump groups, and it suspended its intensive vetting and approval process to recommend donations to a host of groups created since last fall\u2019s election.Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible. Started as a Google document detailing techniques for opposing the Republican agenda under Mr. Trump, the group now has a mostly Washington-based staff of about 40 people, with more than 6,000 volunteer chapters across the country. The national Indivisible hub, which consists of a pair of nonprofit groups, has raised nearly $6 million since its start, primarily through small-dollar donations made through its website.Indivisible would \u201cgladly\u201d accept a check from Mr. Soros or his foundation, said an official with the group, Sarah Dohl. But, she added, the group is committed to ensuring that money from major donors does not become a majority of the group\u2019s revenue \u201cbecause we want to maintain our independence both from the funders and from the party.\u201dThe group may start a political committee that could support primary challenges in 2018 against Democratic incumbents, Ms. Dohl said.The Democracy Alliance's 'resistance map' includes a mix of new and older groups to which the club is recommending its members donate to oppose the Trump administration.Established liberal groups like the Center for American Progress haven\u2019t always been as forceful, Ms. Dohl said, though she added that the think tank \u201chas gotten better at calling on Democrats to stand up and speak more boldly than they have in the past.\u201dDaniella Leger, a CAP official, explained in a statement that the group\u2019s legal team was merely exploring \u201ca standard question\u201d about whether to trademark the logo. \u201cThe immediate response was no \u2014 resistance belongs to everyone,\u201d she said.But the embrace by CAP has some anti-Trump activists complaining privately that the group is anathema to the anti-establishment fervor animating the resistance, and it is siphoning away resources from the new groups.The divisions have sometimes spilled into public view.Matt Bennett, an official at Third Way, challenged predictions that the new wave of resistance activism would substantially shift the axis of the party. \u201cThe idea that all the energy in the Democratic Party is on the far left is premature, and is going to turn out to be the worst prediction of the 2020 cycle,\u201d he said.Mr. Brock and Ms. Leger both said that their groups have been providing research, polling, training and other resources to the new groups, which they cast as a boon to the left, rather than a threat to more established groups.\u201cThe resistance is strongest when everyone has access to our resources,\u201d Mr. Brock said. Ms. Leger said, \u201cThese grass-roots groups play a different, unique role, and their energy is something the progressive movement hadn\u2019t seen in decades.\u201d And a D.N.C. spokeswoman, Xochitl Hinojosa, praised the new groups for their work to \u201cbring about progressive change and elect Democrats.\u201dYet one major Democratic donor, the Virginia real estate developer Albert J. Dwoskin, said the fluidity in the universe of liberal groups would cause some donors to sit on the sidelines \u201cto wait to see which ones have any legs whatsoever.\u201d And veteran Democratic operatives are concerned that the proliferation could further fracture the left, widening ideological divisions and leaving groups fighting for resources.\u201cThe Democratic Party has been fractured,\u201d Mr. Mehlhorn said. \u201cWe believe that by investing in different people and groups to try different techniques that good ideas will emerge.\u201dA Silicon Valley-like competition between start-ups might not be the best thing for the left right now, warned Rob Stein, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped create the Democracy Alliance to provide structure to the institutional left.\u201cHaving a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve got your back against the wall, too many new blooms can cause message and operational cacophony.\u201dHe warned that the combination of ideological and structural divisions, along with a national party weakened by changes in campaign finance laws, could \u201cmake it very, very difficult for progressives and Democrats to drive a coherent message in 2018, and to align behind a single candidate in 2020.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key Document Is Unsealed in Waymo\u2019s Trade Secrets Case Against Uber", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Waymo, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car unit, has been fighting in the courts for months to gain access to a key document in a trade secrets case that it has waged against Uber. That document became public late Monday, adding to the intrigue of whether Uber may have known it was getting stolen information for its autonomous vehicles operation.The document that became public was a due diligence report that Uber commissioned last year before buying an autonomous truck start-up, Ottomotto, for $680 million.The start-up was founded by Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer who had worked at Google\u2019s self-driving unit before it became Waymo. Mr. Levandowski left Google six months before Uber\u2019s acquisition of Ottomotto, and has been at the center of accusations that he stole information about Google\u2019s self-driving technology and used it at Uber.The due diligence report, conducted by the cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg from March 2016 to August 2016, paints one of the clearest pictures of the timeline of events leading up to Uber\u2019s acquisition of Ottomotto and exactly how much Uber knew of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s attempts to retain and access information taken from Google.The Stroz report was kept sealed for months as Uber fought to keep it private. Waymo is using the report\u2019s inclusion into the record to show Uber was aware of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s actions. Waymo has asked for the court to postpone the trial, scheduled for Oct. 10, as it looks into the report and other recent disclosures from Uber.But the report does not appear to clearly answer a main question in the case: Whether or not Uber used any of the designs or technology Mr. Levandowski took with him from Google in Uber\u2019s own self-driving car project.What the report details instead is a history of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s meeting with Uber executives while he was still employed at Google but suggesting working together in some capacity. Mr. Levandowski eventually partnered with Lior Ron, a Google colleague, and pitched the idea for Ottomotto to a group of Google employees over barbecues and a ski trip to Lake Tahoe. The pair convinced roughly a dozen of the Googlers to join their effort, and the group eventually split off from Google to start Ottomotto.After leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski said he found a data storage container in his house containing \u201csource code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars,\u201d according to the report, information that Mr. Levandowski said he downloaded as a matter of \u201chis departure from ordinary course of business.\u201dInvestigators also found evidence of photos of Google self-driving car designs, whiteboard sketches and pictures of hardware and electronic components stored on Mr. Levandowski\u2019s iPhone.\u201cThe Stroz Report unequivocally shows that, before it acquired his company, Uber knew Anthony Levandowski had a massive trove of confidential Waymo source code, design files, technical plans and other materials after leaving Google; that he stole information deliberately, and repeatedly accessed it after leaving Waymo; and that he tried to destroy the evidence of what he had done,\u201d said Johnny Luu, Waymo spokesman.\u201cEven after 60 hours of inspection of our facilities, source code, documents and computers \u2014 no Google material has been found at Uber,\u201d Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a wish worth repeating. It\u2019s an intervention sorely needed in a country seriously lost.God bless America, where shock over a torrent of bullets that sends dozens more to the morgue doesn\u2019t last, if indeed there\u2019s shock at all. This kind of violence is no longer exceptional. But we are. No other affluent country can match our massacres or, in the face of them, our paralysis. We stand out boldly in this regard. We lead.God bless America, awash in self-delusion. House Speaker Paul Ryan responded to the horror in Las Vegas by saying that \u201cwhat truly defines us\u201d are the acts of heroism we learned of, while the shooting itself \u201cis not who we are.\u201d How does he figure that? Las Vegas was one of the worst but hardly the first. And it demands more than the gauzy pieties and press-a-button platitudes that too many politicians spout.God bless America, where the fact that we can\u2019t be 100 percent sure that a given new gun restriction would lessen the dying becomes an excuse not to give it a try, though the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, the sirens couldn\u2019t be louder and each new marker surpasses the last.In Newtown, Conn., in 2012, 26 people perished, 20 of them children. In Orlando four years later, 49 died. And in Las Vegas, the count so far is 59. What\u2019s the trip wire for urgency and action? Triple digits?God bless America, where the Second Amendment seems to be getting a hell of a lot more respect right now than the First. It has become totemic, part of a larger culture war that blinds too many Americans to the amendment\u2019s conception in an entirely different era and context, long before the efficient killing machines of today. There\u2019s the right to bear arms, sure, but there\u2019s also the right to walk into a nightclub or a concert \u2014 or to send a child off to school \u2014 without a sense of dread that\u2019s increasingly and fully warranted. Aren\u2019t we entitled to that, too?God bless America, where we\u2019ve outsourced empathy and righteous anger from the White House to television talk shows and learned to lean on the comedians who host them. On Monday those jokesters seriously channeled our emotions and sounded the appropriate alarms. Politics and entertainment don\u2019t merely overlap. In the Trump era, they\u2019ve traded job descriptions.God bless America, with its sloppy ooze of agenda-driven misinformation. In the hours after the shooting, posts that erroneously identified the shooter and baselessly described him as a Trump-hating liberal or a recent convert to Islam gained serious traction on Google and Facebook, an echo of the fake news in the 2016 presidential election, an example of the conspiracy theories that so many Americans embrace and an illustration of the house of mirrors in which they now stumble around.God bless America, with our boundless talent and galling complacency. If we summon enough gratitude for the former to banish the latter, we just might find our way forward.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Campus Hate Lives on the Internet. Administrators Need to Catch Up.", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusIs there a difference between \u201creal life\u201d and the digital realm?I\u2019ve heard parents and professors talk about these worlds as distinct, but for young people who have grown up with the internet, they are one and the same.One thing that hasn\u2019t been acknowledged enough is how the generation gap has been widened by rapid technological change, especially in regard to social media. The internet is integral to almost every aspect of the lives of young people. The social problems that unfold online are just as real to us as those that happen face to face.In college, this generational social media gap has become a source of misunderstanding and miscommunication between students and administrators. If a problem among students is playing out online, administrators may not know how to help for a number of reasons: They may see the problem as relegated to the digital realm. Or they may not know how the app or platform in question even works.I first became aware of this issue last November when black students at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am a junior, were targeted on a messaging app called GroupMe.GroupMe, it should be said, is a text client like WhatsApp that allows a user to be added to multiple group chats that vary in size from two to 200 members. A group chat over text message requires personal phone numbers or email addresses, but GroupMe is much easier: You can join or be added to different chats using a public Facebook or Google account.The key to the app\u2019s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.Last November, news of the \u201cMud Men\u201d chat spread like wildfire.There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn\u2019s black freshmen and in turn, Penn\u2019s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn\u2019s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.Don\u2019t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat\u2019s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It\u2019s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many. Online or real world: It\u2019s all the same.Najay Greenidge is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A City Campsite, Amenities Included", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorks in ProgressThe last time Charles Traub slept in a tent \u2014 on an army base in Louisiana a half-century ago \u2014 he swore he would never sleep in a tent again. But last weekend, there he was, with his grandson, his partner and her grandson, sleeping under the stars at Fort Tilden in Queens.Except these were no ordinary tents. And this was not camping, but glamping \u2014 as lifestyle blogs refer to so-called glamour camping.\u201cI always wanted to go camping at the beach,\u201d said his partner, Kathy Shorr, a photographer who sleeps most nights in a comfortable bed in her TriBeCa apartment.\u201cBut I fought this pretty hard,\u201d said Mr. Traub, also a photographer. Ms. Shorr convinced him it would be a great experience for their 5-year-old grandchildren.The couple rented two tents: one a furnished safari tent with a queen-size Casper mattress, with solar-powered lights and a small porch with Adirondack chairs, and the other a pup tent with two cots. (Mr. Traub, naturally, got stuck with the pup tent.) Both were equipped with sleeping bags, pillows, platforms, ready-made s\u2019mores packets and a movie-star trailer with three brand-new showers and toilets, complete with coconut-scented body wash, shampoo and conditioner.No squatting in the woods. No sleeping on the ground. No pitching and disassembling tents.All they needed were their overnight bags. And $325.Camp Rockaway, a six-week pilot project running until early November, is the brain child of Kent Johnson, an architect and surfer who got the idea back in 2014 after seeing old postcards of tent colonies in the Rockaways.\u201cI love being out here at dawn and dusk and wanted to figure out how to stay overnight so I could enjoy both,\u201d explained Mr. Johnson, who lives in Forest Hills. \u201cRenting a room didn\u2019t appeal to me, and renting a bungalow was out of reach.\u201d So Mr. Johnson raised $50,000 through Kickstarter to get the project off the ground, then made a bid to the National Park Service for the space.Camp Rockaway was the second of two glamping pilots this year. And though they were both temporary, Mr. Johnson is hoping to return next summer.\u201cAt this point we don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d said Daphne Yun, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service. \u201cBut everything\u2019s on the table.\u201dMr. Johnson and his mother\u2019s boyfriend, a gregarious Texan named Wade Mayer, run the camp night to night \u2014 overseeing seven tents, space for three self-pitched tents, a mess tent with coffee, tea, plates, metal cups and utensils and the use of a camp stove and long table. Meals are not served, though the Dropout restaurant and bar at Riis Park is just a walk down the beach, a local Thai place will deliver, and several guests have taken the short drive to Uma\u2019s, a hip Uzbek spot. One guy brought a pizza with him and some have roasted hot dogs on the long forks the camp provides.The camp, which sits at the edge of a rugby field, just past a goal-post, is a little off the beaten path. Some guests have taken the A train and then the bus to Fort Tilden; others arrive by the ferry from Manhattan and then a shuttle or a taxi. Most, though, have driven.\u201cEveryone wants to get out of the city for a little bit,\u201d said Kristin Rogne, a surfer who also helps manage the Cowgirl bar in the West Village. \u201cAnd this is much easier than setting up your own tent. You just bring a change of clothes and that\u2019s about it.\u201d Though the price is a bit high for camping, she said, Camp Rockaway is less expensive than many other glamping outfits, which can offer gourmet meals and nights in a luxury tent can cost more than $1,000.Ms. Rogne and a friend from Uganda spent a night in one of the high-end safari tents. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like falling asleep and waking up to the sound of the ocean,\u201d she said. But her favorite part of the night was sitting around the campfire with the other guests, talking. \u201cYou don\u2019t have those experiences all the time in the city to connect with people,\u201d she said.The Camp Rockaway crowd has been diverse and the campfire conversation lively. There was the couple that met while working at the United Nations, camping with their two sons. The biotech researcher for HIV and cancer drugs from San Diego visiting with two New York City friends. The adjunct writing professor from Michigan and her friend, a graphic designer from Queens, who had met as students years ago at Bard College. There were visiting monarch butterflies, a few raccoons, rabbits and possums and a flock of Canada geese.\u201cI was curious about the glamping experience,\u201d said Matt Werner, a Google technical writer and playwright, whose latest project is \u201cBurning Man: The Musical.\u201d Mr. Werner was Camp Rockaway\u2019s first guest back in late September. \u201cI also liked that they had a shared campfire. It had that summer camp vibe.\u201d He said it reminded him of his Boy Scout days growing up in California.Mr. Werner had the cheapest setup at Camp Rockaway, pitching his own tent \u2014 with use of the stove, campfire, hammocks and bathroom facilities \u2014 for $65. He rode his bike two hours from Manhattan, with his tent, sleeping bag and overnight bag, and stayed from Sunday to Monday morning.\u201cI woke up around 6 and walked out to the beach,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the sunrise over the Rockaways. It was a great way to start the workweek.\u201dEven Mr. Traub, the reluctant camper, admitted he enjoyed his stay. And although the cot was a bit narrow and his grandson woke up a few times in the night, Mr. Traub was no longer a glamping novice. \u201cIt really was quite wonderful,\u201d he said.ParticularsProject: Camp RockawaySite: Fort Tilden, QueensIn the works: Since 2014Driving force: Architect/surfer Kent JohnsonCost: $249 for a weekend Safari tent ($195 on a weeknight) or $65 to pitch your own tentBiggest obstacle: Finding the right space for a campsite in New York CityAdvertisement"}

Toronti? \u2014 are O.K. with the whole thing.From what I can tell, Sidewalk is doing just the opposite here. Alphabet is interested in a lot of tech that will change the physical world around us, from self-driving cars to robots. This is a way to see how all that stuff will play out in the real world and, even better, to get city officials involved in the planning. That\u2019s better than moving fast and breaking things.The move ratchets up the stakes in the cutthroat world of ride hailing. Uber is working on its own $1 billion deal \u2014 this one with SoftBank \u2014 while automakers and other start-ups look on warily at the state of play.Isn\u2019t it funny that just one year ago Lyft was all but dead in the court of public opinion? Now they\u2019ve got this encouraging second wind, after Uber spent the entire past year in complete disarray.This is unusual in tech. Usually bigger companies have advantages that lead to better products. Amazon, for instance, has greater selection and faster shipping times than any other online retailer, while Facebook has all your friends and family. The ride-hailing business doesn\u2019t seem to have those dynamics \u2014 Uber is far bigger than Lyft, but that size is not evident to customers in any way. Which seems bad for Uber, in the long run.This burns me up. As Facebook continues to say, over and over, that it wants to be as transparent as possible, it neglects the fact that it has fought against external oversight of how its platform worked for years. And on Nov. 1, when Facebook and others are called to testify in the Senate and House, it\u2019s likely that the C.E.O.s or C.O.O.s of these companies won\u2019t even show up to explain what happened.That\u2019s an enormous cop-out in my book. But maybe I\u2019ve just been drinking too much coffee today.Then everyone would be able to claim they\u2019ve fixed the problem and tech companies are wonderful now.

The company\u2019s goal, executives said, is to allow anyone with an internet connection to become proficient with technology and prepare for a job in areas like information technology support and app development.Google detailed its job training program as Silicon Valley faces increasing criticism over what some say is an unchecked influence over business and society. Google is also among a number of companies facing scrutiny over the role their internet services played in Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\u201cWe understand there\u2019s uncertainty and even concern about the pace of technological change, but we know that technology will be an engine of America\u2019s growth for years to come,\u201d Mr. Pichai said. \u201cThe nature of work is fundamentally changing, and that is shifting the link between education, training and opportunity.\u201dGoogle plans to donate $1 billion to nonprofits through its charitable arm, Google.org, with the aim of addressing the gap between the skills required by modern companies and the skills that are taught in schools. Google said it was donating $10 million to Goodwill Industries, for example, for digital job training programs. Company employees also will volunteer one million hours at those nonprofits.Google has long been a leader in research on artificial intelligence, and Mr. Pichai has made it the centerpiece of his company\u2019s plans. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are leaning on A.I. technology in all manner of products, from new smartphones to self-driving cars.

{"Headline": "Canada Letter: Wolves in Captivity and Gord Downie\u2019s Last Album", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames Gorman, a science writer at The Times who often covers the animal world, recently came to Quebec to look at what separates wolves from dogs. Along with gaining a better understanding of the topic, Mr. Gorman developed a moral quandary, as he explains:Holding a wolf pup makes rational thinking go out the window.After a year of talking to an evolutionary biologist about her plan to study the development of wolf pups as a way to understand how domestic dogs evolved, I ended up making two visits to Nicolet, Quebec, last spring and summer to spend time with a brood.The location was Zoo Acad\u00e9mie, a combination zoo and school for animal trainers owned and run by Jacinthe Bouchard, who has trained animals all over the world \u2014 wolves, tigers, elephants. Her strangest experience? \u201cI trained a bat,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t easy, but, Ms. Bouchard insisted, \u201cyou can train anything that has a brain.\u201d After a pause, she added, \u201cSo forget about teenagers. \u201cI first visited the wolves at Zoo Acad\u00e9mie when they were 3 weeks old. They were babies then, still mostly blind and deaf and dependent entirely on scent. Holding and feeding them with a bottle had the same appeal as holding or feeding any baby mammal. It seems to trigger a parental longing to cuddle and nurture, and a tolerance for being peed on. They\u2019re babies! They can\u2019t help it.I returned when the pups were 8 weeks old. They were still incontinent, but then they were really straddling the wolf-dog line. They were fuzzy, but fierce, already more independent than dog puppies their age. I could see the adult wolf coming, and it gave me the sense of being in touch with the wild, something I reveled in.Only when I wasn\u2019t with the wolves did I think about their future, which was to be captives. Ms. Bouchard treats her wolves as well as anyone can, and they have never known the wild, so they don\u2019t know what they are missing. But they are still wolves and as Doug Smith, the scientist who led the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the United States, said to me, wolves have three essential parts to their lives in the wild: they are deeply social and need other wolves, they roam large distances and they kill.In captivity they can have a social life. But they will never roam and kill.On the other hand they may inspire humans to care more about wolves. Seeing or touching an animal like a wolf in a zoo can be exhilarating. Of course, seeing a lone animal, or one pacing in a small enclosure, can be unspeakably sad.I don\u2019t have a fully worked-out moral position on zoos and animal experiments, partly because my job as a reporter trying to be fair is easier if I see the value in many points of view, and partly because my job is the perfect excuse for not coming to a conclusion.But I have to say that those are afterthoughts that don\u2019t really occupy the mind in the middle of spending time with the wolves themselves.I didn\u2019t come up with a conclusion after reporting this story. But I did gain a new sense of how profound the human longing for contact with other species can be. It\u2019s not fundamentally rational. And I wonder if the desire to preserve and save the wild comes from contact with it. Can reason lead people to passion? The answer is, fortunately, beyond my job description.I checked in with Ms. Bouchard this week for an update. She said the pups, at 5 months, now weigh 85 pounds. They are at a dangerous stage for handlers, because they are still puppies, wanting to bite and tussle as part of play, but with adult jaws and strength. They have \u201cT. rex teeth,\u201d she said.Two of the pups went to BioParc in the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula and the other four are with their parents at Zoo Acad\u00e9mie. I\u2019m planning to visit them again, but I think next time I\u2019ll just be watching, not cuddlingCanadians knew that time was running short for Gord Downie, the singer-songwriter and member of the Tragically Hip. But when news alerts and social media posts this week announced that the man whose lyrics gave voice to Canada had died of brain cancer, it seemed slightly unreal.\u201cThe place of honor that Mr. Downie occupies in Canada\u2019s national imagination has no parallel in the United States,\u201d Simon Vozick-Levinson wrote in an article about the recording of Mr. Downie\u2019s final album. \u201cImagine Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Michael Stipe combined into one sensitive, oblique poet-philosopher, and you\u2019re getting close.\u201dTrade relations between Canada and the United States continued downward again this week on a variety of fronts.The most sensitive of the trade spats, a preliminary tariff from the Trump administration that quadruples the prices of Bombardier\u2019s new C Series airliner in the United States, took an unexpected turn this week. After spending more than $5 billion to create the airliner, the Montreal-based Bombardier sold just over 50 percent of it to Europe\u2019s Airbus. Underscoring Bombardier\u2019s desire to save the project, Airbus will not pay a penny or take on any of the project\u2019s debt. The move will, however, mean that the plane can dodge the new American tariff by shifting some of its production from Canada to an Airbus assembly line in Alabama.President Trump\u2019s end-of-the-year deadline for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement was extended this week to sometime next year. But given the demands put forward by his administration over the past few days, many of which went beyond unacceptable for both Canada and Mexico, there was little optimism that more time will produce an agreement.Ana Swanson, the Times\u2019s trade reporter, made her way to Digby Neck, Nova Scotia, to illustrate a part of Nafta in which Canada is often a loser: provisions that allow American companies to claim millions of dollars in damages when Canadian governments enforce environmental laws.And Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City this week about the preparations there for economic life without the trade pact. While Mexico is looking for alternative sources of imports, Canada doesn\u2019t seem to be high on its list. Argentina is poised to sell it 30,000 tons of wheat.Britain is not the first place that comes to mind when thinking about hockey talent. But the writer Tal Pinchevsky has told the improbable story of Tony Hand from Edinburgh. During the 1980s, Mr. Hand was signed twice by the Edmonton Oilers, the dominant team of the era. Both times, however, he headed back home and finished his season in Britain.\u201cThis story about a woman\u2019s bravery, remorse and wisdom and then the message she receives from her father long after he died, gave me both hope and chills at the same time,\u201d she said.Correction:Walmart came to Canada 23 years ago, not 17 years ago, as I wrote in last week\u2019s newsletter, an error some of you pointed out.Advertisement"}

Mine happened in college, with a professor who was older than my father and who made me think he was genuinely interested in my writing. One day in his office, he told me he wanted to \u201ckiss and molest\u201d me. I muttered something about having a boyfriend and fled.As stories like this go, I got off easy. I remember thinking at the time, \u201cHuh, so this is sexual harassment.\u201d I wasn\u2019t particularly traumatized, but it was a blow to my faith in my own talents. I felt ridiculous for having believed that this man, whom I very much admired, saw me as a person with promise instead of an easy mark.After Hillary Clinton\u2019s shattering loss, it sometimes seems like female leadership itself has fallen out of fashion. The president is a misogynist thug who has boasted of some of the same crimes Weinstein is being pilloried for. His daughter and adviser, Ivanka Trump, mouths platitudes about female empowerment while supporting the rollback of a federal rule on equal pay. Her attempt to portray herself as a champion of \u201cWomen Who Work,\u201d the title of her most recent book, seems tailor-made to support left-wing critiques of what\u2019s sometimes called \u201ccorporate feminism,\u201d a feminism that fetishizes the success of elite women.Nevertheless, as long as we have a hierarchal society, the gender of those at the top matters. In any field where women consistently have to please men to realize their ambitions \u2014 or simply to survive \u2014 there will be exploitation. Right now, that\u2019s almost every field, and that\u2019s what has to change. No woman just starting out should ever be told she has to choose between working for a Harvey Weinstein and working for a Mike Pence.

{"Headline": "Google Finds Accounts Connected to Russia Bought Election Ads", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has found evidence that Russian agents bought ads on its wide-ranging networks in an effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential campaign.The findings from an internal inquiry draw Google further into the growing investigation of how social networks and technology services were manipulated by the Russian government to spread misinformation and sow division during the 2016 election.Using accounts believed to be connected to the Russian government, the agents purchased $4,700 worth of search ads and more traditional display ads, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s inquiry who was not allowed to speak about it publicly. Google found the accounts through its own research and information provided by other technology companies.Google found a separate $53,000 worth of ads with political material that were purchased from Russian internet addresses, building addresses or with Russian currency. It is not clear whether any of those were connected to the Russian government, and they may have been purchased by Russian citizens, the person said.The messages of those ads spanned the political spectrum. One account spent $7,000 on ads to promote a documentary called \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Trumped,\u201d a film about Donald J. Trump\u2019s efforts to build a golf course in Scotland along an environmentally sensitive coastline. Another spent $36,000 on ads questioning whether President Barack Obama needed to resign. Yet another bought ads to promote political merchandise for Mr. Obama.The ads appeared mainly alongside Google\u2019s search results or on websites that use Google ads outside the search company\u2019s own sites. It was not clear whether such ads appeared on YouTube or the Gmail email service, the person said.There is a chance that Google may find other ads from Russian-linked accounts, the person familiar with the investigation said.Microsoft, a distant rival to Google in the internet search and advertising market, said Monday evening that it too was examining whether suspected Russian agents used its services to show political ads during the 2016 election. Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine accounts for about 23 percent of searches in the United States, compared with more than 63 percent for Google, according comScore, an internet measurement firm.Google has been called to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1. But it has so far escaped the intense scrutiny confronting Facebook after the social network admitted that it discovered 470 profiles and pages to the internet Research Agency, a Russian company with ties to the Kremlin.The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said on Monday that it should not be surprising that Russians were using Google as well as Facebook and Twitter. The only thing that is surprising, he said, is that it took so long for Google to find the activity.\u201cIt will take more time and length and breadth to know what Russia did on social media,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cBut the themes are consistent across platforms: the desire to help Donald Trump, to hurt Hillary Clinton and the desire to set Americans against each other.\u201dIn addition to the Senate committee hearing, Google and Facebook are expected to testify at another Nov. 1 hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. Twitter was also invited to the House committee hearing, but it was not clear on Monday whether officials from the company planned to attend.But Google\u2019s investigation has not found the same type of pinpoint advertising that Russian agents conducted on Facebook. The social network allows advertisers to target its audience with more specificity than Google, including users with a wide range of political leanings.The 2016 presidential election was the first time that Google allowed targeting by political leanings and it allowed just two categories \u2014 left-leaning and right-leaning.However, Google has not found any evidence that the ads from the accounts suspected of having ties to the Russian government used these political categories or geographic parameters to focus on specific groups, the person familiar with the company\u2019s investigation said. The ads were much more broad, aimed at English-language queries or any users in the United States, for example.A Google spokeswoman, Andrea Faville, said the company had a policy that limited political ad targeting and prohibited targeting based on race and religion.\u201cWe are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,\u201d Ms. Faville said.On Facebook, fake Russia-linked accounts \u2014 in which fictional people posed as American activists \u2014 promoted inflammatory messages on divisive issues. Those accounts bought advertising to promote those messages and reach a bigger audience within the Facebook universe, while promoting the incendiary posts to different locations or people with established political leanings for maximum impact.The Russian-linked accounts did not target ads based on political affiliation, but it raises the question of why Google allowed such targeting for the 2016 election when it had not done so in the past. The only location where Google allows ad targeting by political affiliation is the United States.Google is working with Jigsaw, a think tank owned by its parent company, Alphabet. Jigsaw has been doing research for 18 months on fake news and misinformation campaigns and Google is applying some of those findings in the investigation into Russian election meddling, the person said. It is also working with other technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, in addition to independent researchers and law enforcement.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter @daiwakaCecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington, and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Favored Outlet Is an Online News Giant. YouTube Helped.", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Kremlin-aligned agents secretly built fake Facebook groups to foment political division and deployed hordes of Twitter bots to stoke criticism of Hillary Clinton, RT worked out in the open, bolstered by one of the largest online audiences of any news organization in the world and a prominent presence on YouTube\u2019s search results.\u201cMore than half of American adults say they watch YouTube, and younger viewers are moving to YouTube at staggering numbers,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia\u2019s exploitation of social media platforms based in the United States. \u201cYouTube is a target-rich environment for any disinformation campaign \u2014 Russian or otherwise \u2014 that represents a long-term, next-generation challenge.\u201dYouTube carries \u201ca wide variety of news channels\u201d that represent \u201can array of viewpoints across the political spectrum,\u201d said a spokesman for the company, Chris Dale.RT\u2019s reach on YouTube \u2014 2.2 million subscribers, just slightly behind CNN \u2014 stemmed from a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the news channel and the video site, according to current and former RT employees and technology industry analysts.YouTube had the vast audience and global reach that RT needed as it set out to become a worldwide alternative news source with influence and viewers beyond Russia\u2019s own borders. RT has YouTube channels in a number of foreign languages including Arabic, Spanish, German, French and Chinese.\u201cRT management did view YouTube as hugely important to spreading content,\u201d said Liz Wahl, a former correspondent in the United States for RT who quit on the air in 2014 over concerns that the network was whitewashing the Russian annexation of Crimea. \u201cTraditional television ratings weren\u2019t important because the aim was to get the messaging out through various digital and social platforms.\u201dThe viral videos, which were often borrowed from other sources, help to build up RT\u2019s subscribers, and they became part of the Kremlin\u2019s audience for more political content.While much of RT\u2019s traffic stems from nonpolitical videos, the channel\u2019s political and foreign affairs content ranks highly in many YouTube searches. Searches on topics on which the Kremlin is typically eager to promote its point of view \u2014 American intervention in Syria, the Ukrainian civil war or the rise of Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party \u2014 will often turn up an RT video as one of the top results.Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RT\u2019s deputy editor in chief, said the organization had not been informed of Google\u2019s decision and it was puzzled about why it was dropped despite being \u201cone of the most watched YouTube channels in the world.\u201d\u201cThis speaks to the unprecedented political pressure increasingly applied to all RT partners and relationships in a concerted effort to push our channel out of the U.S. market entirely, and by any means possible,\u201d Mr. Karnovich-Valua wrote in an email.Last month, RT said the Justice Department had demanded that a private company affiliated with RT America register as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d \u2014 a term that dates back to a law originally enacted in 1938 to deter Nazi propaganda. On Thursday, after the deadline set by American officials had passed, an RT spokeswoman said that the news organization was \u201cdoing everything possible for RT to avoid having to register.\u201d Registration could impose voluminous disclosure requirements on RT, a particular burden for a media organization producing frequent content.Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, responded in more forceful terms: Should the United States impose restrictions on Russian media, Mr. Putin said last week, Russian would act \u201csymmetrically and quite swiftly.\u201dBut none of RT\u2019s social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel. RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site. At the time, YouTube was better known for pirated content and videos of cute animals than news programming, but RT caught on quickly.The Russian channel recruited talent from within the burgeoning world of YouTube-born media stars, people who had already shown a knack for creating viral or popular video content.Mr. Karnovich-Valua said RT\u2019s primary aim is to provide an alternative point of view on current events so its audience can get a full picture of world events. \u201cWhere relevant, RT does present a Russian perspective on current events, but we don\u2019t promote the Russian point of view, we explain it alongside with presenting others,\u201d he said.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter @daiwaka Follow Nicholas Confessore on Twitter @nickconfessoreAdvertisement"}

Could they attract all the deals in one sector in the way that Mr. Son has with tech?But who can serve as an anchor investor for other funds, as Saudi Arabia has done with a $45 billion investment in Vision Fund?

(Send us your suggestions or tips.)Of course, it\u2019s possible that these are just the dreams of envious rival investors, hoping to collect enormous fees.And then there was this:Andrew also interviewed a robot and said it was the strangest, yet oddly captivating, \u201cinterview\u201d he ever conducted. The robot, Sophia, said she was designed \u201caround human values like wisdom, kindness, compassion.\u201dAndrew told the robot that we want to prevent bad things from happening in the future.Sophia: \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading too much Elon Musk. And watching too many Hollywood movies.\u201dToday, the House is scheduled to vote on its 2018 budget resolution, intended to lay groundwork for a Republican tax overhaul. But what they\u2019re voting on still isn\u2019t clear.What they\u2019re still fighting over:\u2022 Limits on tax deductions for 401(k) savings accounts, which President Trump has publicly opposed but which some House Republicans still favor.\u2022 Limits on deductions for state and local taxes \u2014 known as SALT \u2014 which a potentially crucial group of House Republicans, including Peter King of New York and Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, opposes.That the House is still proceeding with the vote shows that Republican leadership believes it can pass the resolution. (The House majority whip, Steve Scalise, told reporters last night, \u201cIt\u2019s looking good.\u201d) Remember that if the House can\u2019t pass its budget resolution, Republicans may not be able to move ahead with their tax proposal without votes from Democrats.Speaking of the tax overhaul:Elsewhere in Washington:Kirsten Grind, Tom McGinty and Sarah Krouse of the WSJ reported that employees have expressed discomfort with the star-rating system\u2019s outsize role in helping investors pick mutual funds:Stephen Wendel, head of behavioral science at the Chicago-based firm, wrote in the June/July issue of Morningstar magazine that part of his job was \u201cexamining whether we are contributing to abuses in the industry.\u201dThe Journal\u2019s story notwithstanding, the star rating has been a useful starting point for research that tilts the odds of success in investors\u2019 favor.

For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar.

{"Headline": "When an Algorithm Helps Send You to Prison", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 2013, police officers in Wisconsin arrested a man driving a car that had been used in a recent shooting. The man, Eric Loomis, pleaded guilty to attempting to flee an officer, and no contest to operating a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent. Neither of his crimes mandates prison time.At Mr. Loomis\u2019s sentencing, the judge cited, among other factors, Mr. Loomis\u2019s high risk of recidivism as predicted by a computer program called COMPAS, a risk assessment algorithm used by the state of Wisconsin. The judge denied probation and prescribed an 11-year sentence: six years in prison, plus five years of extended supervision.No one knows exactly how COMPAS works; its manufacturer refuses to disclose the proprietary algorithm. We only know the final risk assessment score it spits out, which judges may consider at sentencing.Mr. Loomis challenged the use of an algorithm as a violation of his due process rights to be sentenced individually, and without consideration of impermissible factors like gender. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected his challenge. In June, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear his case, meaning a majority of justices effectively condoned the algorithm\u2019s use. Their decision will have far-ranging effects.Something about this story is fundamentally wrong: Why are we allowing a computer program, into which no one in the criminal justice system has any insight, to play a role in sending a man to prison?At a sentencing, it is entirely a judge\u2019s prerogative to prescribe a sentence within statutory guidelines. The obvious flaw with this system is bias. Judges might abuse this unchecked power to sentence based not only on relevant factors, such as the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s offense, but also on those that are morally and constitutionally problematic \u2014 for example, gender and race.But shifting the sentencing responsibility to a computer does not necessarily eliminate bias; it delegates and often compounds it.Algorithms like COMPAS simply mimic the data with which we train them. COMPAS\u2019s authors presumably fed historical recidivism data into their system. From that, the program ascertained what factors tend to make a defendant a higher risk. It then applied the patterns it gleaned to subsequent defendants, like Mr. Loomis, to spit out sentences that comport with existing trends.Even if you think Mr. Loomis\u2019s sentencing procedure arrived at the appropriate result, the potential that the process the state took to arrive there was biased \u2014 in ways neither judges nor defendants nor prosecutors know \u2014 should alarm anyone.Algorithms also lack the human ability to individualize. A computer cannot look a defendant in the eye, account for a troubled childhood or disability, and recommend a rehabilitative sentence. This is precisely the argument against mandatory minimum sentences \u2014 they rob judges of the discretion to deliver individualized justice \u2014 and it is equally cogent against machine sentencing.For example, algorithms are often programmed to assume unidirectional causation: If A, then B. But is it truly that defendants with higher rates of recidivism warrant longer sentences or is it that defendants with longer sentences are kept out of their communities, unemployed and away from their families longer, naturally increasing their recidivism risk? A judge could investigate this nuance.For now, the only people with visibility into COMPAS\u2019s functioning are its programmers, who are in many ways less equipped than judges to deliver justice. Judges have legal training, are bound by ethical oaths, and must account for not only their decisions but also their reasoning in published opinions. Programmers lack each of these safeguards.Computers may be intelligent, but they are not wise. Everything they know, we taught them, and we taught them our biases. They are not going to un-learn them without transparency and corrective action by humans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s Ad System Works", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySimilar ad purchases by Russian agents were also uncovered on other internet services like Google and Twitter.The online ads in question do not necessarily fit the traditional idea of advertising, and Facebook\u2019s ads are particularly unusual.Facebook\u2019s primary ad system plugs straight into the Facebook News Feed, the stream of information that serves as the primary interface for the social network. This system was created to deliver ads that could grab your attention as effectively as what internet companies call \u201corganic content\u201d \u2014 posts from your friends and family and other entities you are connected to on Facebook.Indeed, ads are often the same as organic content, just with money behind them. \u201cThere is an ad-selling mechanism, but the ad itself isn\u2019t really an ad. It\u2019s content,\u201d said Ron Berman, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton business school who studies online advertising, including the Facebook ad system.Facebook was part of a gradual but significant change in online advertising over the past decade. As more people have moved more of their online activity from PCs to mobile phones, the lines between ads and organic content have continued to blur, particularly on popular social networking service like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.Mobile phones offer less room on their screens for ads. Usually, there is only space for a single column of information, and that must accommodate both ads and other content. The result is that ads have moved into a more prominent position.Consider the Google search engine. If you type the word \u201cSamsung\u201d into Google on a laptop, a Samsung ad is likely to appear at the top of the screen, above the list of search results chosen by Google. But if you do the same thing on a typical smartphone, the ad is likely to take up the entire screen.These are Facebook pages built by businesses and other organizations on the social network. Facebook allows businesses and other advertisers to serve pages straight into the News Feeds of people they had no other connection to, targeting their particular interests and behavior.As these pages appear, people can comment on them and \u201clike\u201d them, just as they can with anything else that shows up in their feeds. And if people click the like button, these pages will continue to show up in their feeds \u2014 and the feeds of their Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d \u2014 for free.On Facebook, people describe themselves and leave all sorts of digital bread crumbs that show their interests. Then Facebook matches these with other data it collects.Facebook\u2019s ad system provides ways to target geographic locations, personal interests, characteristics and behavior, including activity on other internet services and even in physical stores. Advertisers can target people based on their political affiliation; how likely they are to engage with political content; whether they like to jog, hike or hunt; what kind of beer they like; and so on.If advertisers provide a list for email addresses, Facebook can try to target the people those addresses belong to. It can also do what is called \u201clook-alike matching.\u201d In this case, Facebook\u2019s algorithms serve ads to people believed to be similar to the people those addresses belong to.Like Google and others, Facebook runs an instant digital auction for each ad placement, considering bid prices from many advertisers. An advertiser might bid $2 to place an ad in a particular situation. Then Facebook weighs these bids against how relevant the ad is to that situation. If an ad is relevant, the advertiser need not bid as high to win the auction.Unlike similar services, Facebook does not just consider how relevant an ad is next to the other available ads. It considers how relevant an ad is next to all other content, and it chooses ads based on how well they compete for attention with organic posts.Google says it runs separate teams and separate technology for organic content and ads. The algorithm for organic content does not consider ads, and vice versa.Facebook\u2019s arrangement is a little different because the ad auction considers organic content as well. Ads are also reviewed by a mix of algorithms and human moderators to determine if they are breaking company policies. Facebook recently said it would add 1,000 more human moderators to the team that reviews ads.By the fall of 2015, the Facebook ad engine was also driving ads on Instagram, which the company had acquired three years earlier. Twitter works a bit differently from these services, but the dynamic is similar. Twitter ads are merely posts that business and others pay to place in the feeds of individuals who match certain criteria.As all these companies point out, paid advertisements are labeled ads or \u201csponsored\u201d or \u201cpromoted\u201d content. Facebook executives add that ads also usually include some sort of call to action, such as \u201cLiking\u201d a page.Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ads products, said in a statement that the people who manage content from regular users and people who manage ads coordinate their work but operate in separate organizations, with different goals and policies.\u201cOur goal is to make ads on Facebook just as useful and relevant as posts people see from friends and family,\u201d Mr. Goldman said. \u201cBut we also want people to know when they\u2019re looking at an ad, so we clearly label them as sponsored.\u201dBut the line between ads and content has blurred in ways that may not be obvious. If you \u201clike\u201d an ad, for example, posts from the same account will turn up in your feed automatically, without paid promotion \u2014 and without the \u201csponsored\u201d tags.These posts are not just free advertising, Mr. Berman said, but also something that people see as more credible and that Facebook is more likely share in the feeds of these people\u2019s \u201cfriends.\u201d On a service like Facebook, the effect of an ad can extend well beyond what an advertiser paid for.It\u2019s not clear. Facebook said about 10 million people had seen the ads.Mr. Berman said that published academic studies, including one of his own, indicated that people were more likely to share sensational content \u2014 content that generates an emotional response. That could include posts related to gun control, gay rights or race relations.If an advertiser posts an ad that is widely shared, this is still more free advertising. And from the perspective of the Facebook ad engine, that is a relevant ad. This means the cost of the next ad goes down. And the cycle continues.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of Privacy", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsGiven the constant stream of breaches, it can be hard to understand what\u2019s happening to our privacy over time. Two dates \u2014 one recent and one long ago \u2014 help explain this: Dec. 15, 1890, and May 23, 2017, are the two most important days in the history of privacy. The first signifies its creation as a legal concept, and the latter, while largely overlooked at the time, symbolizes something close to its end.Today, however, this distinction has eroded, thanks to the rapid advance of digital technologies and the accompanying rise of the field broadly called data science. What we have thought of as privacy is dying, if not already dead.Just five years later, this argument makes much less sense: \u201cSustained monitoring\u201d is now a part of our digital lives. And that\u2019s why what happened on May 23, 2017, is so important.Google may be the first to formally make this link, but it is hardly alone. Among technology companies, the rush to create comprehensive offline profiles of online users is on, driven by the need to monetize online services offered free.And even without these advanced methods, finding out who we are and what we like and do has never been easier. Thanks to the trails created by our continuous online activities, it has become nearly impossible to remain anonymous in the digital age.So what to do?This is part of the approach now being taken by European regulators. One of the cornerstones of the European Union\u2019s new regulatory framework for data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., is the idea of purpose-based restrictions on data. In order for an organization or public authority to use personal data gathered in the European Union, it must first specify what that data is going to be used for. The G.D.P.R. sets forth six broad categories of acceptable purposes, including when an individual has directly consented to a specific use for the data to when data processing is necessary for the public interest. If data is issued for an unauthorized purpose, legal liability ensues. The G.D.P.R. is far from perfect, but it is on to something big.Many privacy advocates will no doubt find it hard to stomach that the way we think about protecting our data is outdated. But if we are to maintain the ability to assert control over the data we generate, we must also admit that our past ideas of what it means to be \u201clet alone\u201d no longer apply.Andrew Burt is chief privacy officer and legal engineer at Immuta.

{"Headline": "Start-Up Bets on Tech Talent Pipeline From Africa", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Tolulope Komolafe first heard the pitch, she was skeptical. A fledgling company in Lagos, Nigeria, would pay her to learn how to write modern computer code and then offer her a good job in the high-tech economy.\u201cI thought it was a con,\u201d she recalled. \u201cToo good to be true.\u201dAfter inquiring, Ms. Komolafe found the offer was real. Today, she is a software developer, working remotely from Lagos for a start-up in New York, and she dreams of starting her own tech company someday.Ms. Komolafe, a 27-year-old Nigerian, is one of hundreds of young Africans who have joined Andela, a fast-growing start-up based in New York that has attracted the attention and money of people like the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and works with blue-chip companies like Mastercard.The company\u2019s ambitious agenda spans education, economic development and moneymaking. It is betting on its ability to build out a talent pipeline of African software developers to the United States and elsewhere, tapping into a continent eager to connect to the global digital economy.Jeremy Johnson, Andela\u2019s chief executive, says the company offers \u201ca very different model for unlocking human potential.\u201dNot only does Andela instruct people in person, but 20,000 aspiring programmers across Africa have used its free online learning and training tools. By 2024, Andela hopes to have helped prepare 100,000 software developers in Africa for jobs, including thousands working for Andela.After six months of paid training, the Andela employees become remote members of software development teams at companies. The current roster of 112 customers includes Viacom, Mastercard Labs, GitHub and SeatGeek in the United States, and clients in 10 other countries.\u201cThis is a platform for giving people who want to learn and succeed access and opportunity,\u201d said Seni Sulyman, a 32-year-old graduate of Harvard Business School, who is the country director for Andela in Nigeria.The challenge for Andela will be expanding its model to meet its lofty growth targets. \u201cAndela has delivered on its promise so far, but can it keep finding high-quality talent and finding relevant employment for them as it gets bigger?\u201d asked Aniedi Udo-Obong, a Google program manager who works with software developers in Africa.Andela\u2019s growth plans got an enthusiastic endorsement this week from its financial backers, with a $40 million round of venture funding that lifts the total the company has raised to $80 million. The new investment was announced on Tuesday.During a tour of Africa last year, Mr. Zuckerberg visited Andela\u2019s Lagos office and told the employees, \u201cYou are all part of something that\u2019s really important.\u201dSpark Capital and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative were the lead investors in two earlier rounds of funding for Andela. CRE Venture Capital, based in Cape Town, South Africa, is the lead investor in the new $40 million round, the largest venture round led by an African firm, said Pule Taukobong, a founding partner of CRE Venture Capital.Andela began with a founding team of six \u2014 three Africans, two Americans and a Canadian \u2014 and an initial test class of four students. It now employs 800 people, and it expects to double that number in the next year. While it has its headquarters in New York and a small office in San Francisco, 90 percent of its workers are in Africa, with offices in Lagos; Nairobi, Kenya; and Kampala, Uganda.Though growing fast, Andela has been highly selective. Applicants undergo dozens of online drills to assess everything from technical ability to personality type. About 3 percent of the applicants are invited to a two-week boot camp, and a final cut takes the acceptance rate below 1 percent.The new hires get a MacBook computer, subsidized housing and two meals a day during their six-month training program. In that time, Andela invests $15,000 in each developer. Starting salaries are low, but after the developers begin working as billable contractors for companies, their pay rises, up to $30,000 or so, comparable to salaries for young professionals in Africa\u2019s urban centers.Andela makes money much like consulting or law firms. It charges clients per worker, with part passed on to the worker as salary and Andela collecting the remainder. The company declined to detail its billing practices.Andela\u2019s recruits sign contracts for two years, but are expected to stay for four years. That longevity is part of the business model, since the work of developers on contract to customers helps pay to recruit and train new hires. So far, the retention rate is 98 percent.None of the developers have hit the four-year threshold yet. Andela would be happy to have them stay beyond that, but it is also encouraging them to go work for other companies or start their own. It is setting up an Andela accelerator to nurture alumni start-ups.\u201cWe want them to go out to become leading entrepreneurs and leading technologists in Africa,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.The Andela developers are young \u2014 the average age is under 25 \u2014 and 70 percent have computer science or engineering degrees. But university curriculums in Africa, technologists say, tend to emphasize theory rather than modern programming tools and the techniques of fast-paced software development in teams.Last year, the company needed more engineering talent to expand. But with Google and Facebook hiring in Austin, the company did not want to compete in the escalating bidding war for local talent, said Meetesh Karia, Zebra\u2019s chief technology officer.Instead, it gave Andela a try.The developers, Mr. Karia said, have worked out well \u2014 aided in part by Andela\u2019s customized approach to outsourcing.Andela sends its developers to customer sites to meet people and learn about the client\u2019s business. Mr. Oshodi spent a month in Austin last year, and recently finished another three-week visit. He and the other Adela programmers have been invited to backyard barbecues and nights out in downtown Austin.\u201cThey know my family. They know my kids,\u201d Mr. Karia said. \u201cThey are really part of the team.\u201dThe Andela developers are on the same corporate mailing lists and chat channels as Zebra employees. When back in Africa, the Andela members of the team participate in the daily \u201cstand-up meeting,\u201d where developers talk about their work and plans, usually via a video link.One of the initial group of developers, Mr. Karia said, did not work out. But Andela soon replaced that person. Now, Mr. Karia said, \u201cI would love to hire all eight\u201d when their four-year commitments to Andela are over.Mr. Oshodi\u2019s four-year clock runs out in 2019. Until then, he said, he wants to steadily enhance his product development and management skills. He has not decided what comes next, but he is optimistic.\u201cIf you put yourself in a good place,\u201d Mr. Oshodi said, \u201copportunity comes.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}

That is the sort of story the tech industry loves to tell about itself: It is bringing freedom, enlightenment and a better future for all mankind.Their amount of concentrated authority resembles the divine right of kings, and is sparking a backlash that is still gathering force.\u201cFor 10 years, the arguments in tech were about which chief executive was more like Jesus. Which one was going to run for president. Who did the best job convincing the work force to lean in,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cNow sentiments are shifting. The worm has turned.\u201dUnderlying the meet-and-greets is the reality that the internet long ago became a business, which means the companies\u2019 first imperative is to do right by their stockholders.\u201cFor all the lip service that Silicon Valley has given to changing the world, its ultimate focus has been on what it can monetize,\u201d Mr. Baird said.\u201cThe result?\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery voice is heard. The cacophony more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harassment and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen.\u201dSuch complaints, repeated at regular intervals, did not stop the tech world from seizing the moment. Millions and then billions of people flocked to its services. The chief executives were regarded as sages. Disruption was the highest good.Mr. Rosenstein, a co-founder of Asana, an office productivity start-up, said in an email that he had banned not just Facebook but also the Safari and Chrome browsers, Gmail and other applications.\u201cI realized that I spend a lot of time mindlessly interacting with my phone in ways that aren\u2019t serving me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook is a very powerful tool that I continue to use every day, just with more mindfulness.\u201dIf social media is on the defensive, Mr. Zuckerberg is particularly on the spot \u2014 a rare event in a golden career that has made him, at 33, one of the richest and most influential people on the planet.\u201cWe have a saying: \u2018Move fast and break things,\u2019\u201d he wrote in his 2012 manifesto. \u201cThe idea is that if you never break anything, you\u2019re probably not moving fast enough.\u201dFacebook dropped that motto two years later, but critics say too much of the implicit arrogance has lingered. Mr. Galloway, whose new book, \u201cThe Four,\u201d analyzes the power of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, said the social media network was still fumbling its response.\u201cZuckerberg and Facebook are violating the No. 1 rule of crisis management: Overcorrect for the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir attitude is that anything that damages their profits is impossible for them to do.\u201dJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, said the network was doing its best.\u201cFacebook is an important part of many people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous responsibility \u2014 and one that we take incredibly seriously.\u201dSome social media entrepreneurs acknowledge that they are confronting issues they never imagined as employees of start-ups struggling to survive.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to think through the repercussions of everything we did,\u201d Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, said in an interview shortly before he rejoined the service last spring.He maintained that Twitter was getting an unfair rap: \u201cFor every bad thing, there are a thousand good things.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that sometimes \u201cit gets a little messy.\u201dDespite the swell of criticism, the vast majority of investors, consumers and regulators seem not to have changed their behavior. People still eagerly await the new iPhone. Facebook has more than two billion users. President Trump likes to criticize Amazon on Twitter, but his administration ignored pleas for a rigorous examination of Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods.\u201cThis war, like so many wars, is going to start in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor.For some tech companies, the new power is a heavy weight. Cloudflare, which provides many sites with essential protection from hacking, made its first editorial decision in August: It lifted its protection from The Daily Stormer, basically expunging the neo-Nazi site from the visible web.\u201cIncreasingly tech companies are going to be put into the position of making these sorts of judgments,\u201d said Matthew Prince, Cloudflare\u2019s chief executive.The picture is likely to get even more complicated. Mr. Prince foresees several possible dystopian futures. One is where every search engine has a political point of view, and users gravitate toward the one they feel most comfortable with. That would further balkanize the internet.Another possibility is the opposite extreme: Under the pressure of regulation, all hate speech \u2014 and eventually all dissent \u2014 is filtered out.\u201cPeople are realizing that technology isn\u2019t neutral,\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cI used to travel to Europe to hear these fears.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. to Loosen Rules on Local Media Ownership", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices.The commission\u2019s chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion.But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated. They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google.\u201cThe marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975,\u201d Mr. Pai said.It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry. Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry.The announcement on Wednesday, at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing, pleased newspaper groups and broadcast stations, which have lobbied for changes that they say are necessary to compete with online media giants like YouTube and Facebook.\u201cThe news media industry must have economies of scale to compete in today\u2019s marketplace and to reinvest in reporters and news-gathering operations that maintain an informed democracy and a functioning society,\u201d said David Chavern, president of the newspaper trade group News Media Alliance, of which The New York Times is a member.But consumer groups have denounced Mr. Pai\u2019s fervor for deregulation of the media industry. He has argued that he is trying to create a more level playing field for traditional and online media. But broadcast television remains a popular source of news for most Americans, and consumer groups fear that the aggressive elimination of rules will lead to a few giant corporations like Sinclair or the Walt Disney Company controlling the vast majority of TV content.\u201cAjit Pai\u2019s announcement today is the most retrograde I have ever heard from an F.C.C. chairman.\u201d said Michael Copps, a former Democratic commissioner of the F.C.C. and a special adviser to the nonprofit watchdog Common Cause. \u201cApparently, he has lost all sense of self-restraint.

We\u2019re thinking more about George Soros\u2019s big philanthropic move \u2014 while noting that he still hasn\u2019t signed the Giving Pledge. More on that in a moment.But should they be resting easy?Look at how the market reacted to the proposal by Senators Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander, to continue funding insurer subsidies for two years:But remember:\u2022 President Trump said that he supported the proposed compromise, although he could change his mind, and passage by Congress is far from assured.\u2022 The president also has let insurers sell cheaper, less comprehensive plans that could undermine the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges. Critics say that could lead to higher premiums for those who remain on exchange plans.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, hailed the agreement as a model for how the two parties could work together on other issues, such as taxes.There has never been any assurance that Democrats will join Republicans to pass a tax plan that favors only corporations.Recalcitrant lawmakers may have more ammunition for their stance from an unusual source: a Harvard University economist whose work has been cited by the White House in its assertion that lower corporate taxes could raise household incomes by as much as $9,000.The top end of that estimate was based on work by a trio of researchers, and on Tuesday one of them, Mihir Desai of Harvard, said Mr. Trump\u2019s team had misread the research.

{"Headline": "Sheryl Sandberg Blitzes Washington in P.R. Push for Facebook", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For months, Facebook has been trying to counter criticism about its influence on the 2016 presidential election. The company has hired three crisis communications firms and has bought digital and newspaper ads. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has posted live video to the social network to explain how much he cared about election integrity.This week, it sent Sheryl Sandberg to Washington to charm Congress and the public.Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, acted as the giant tech company\u2019s chief ambassador in the capital on Wednesday and Thursday \u2014 shuttling around to talk with dozens of lawmakers, and making numerous promises about how the company would change.In a public appearance hosted by Axios, the news start-up, she admitted that Facebook had made mistakes during the presidential campaign. She offered lawmakers who are investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the election more data from the company. And she promised the Congressional Black Caucus that she would help appoint an African-American to the Facebook board.\u201cShe said 10 to 15 times, \u2018We\u2019ve got to do better,\u2019\u201d Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democrat from Missouri, said after Ms. Sandberg met with the Congressional Black Caucus, which has complained about the level of diversity at the company.In addition to the new crisis communications firms, the company has placed ads in places like The New York Times and The Washington Post. But it has been difficult to quell the concerns of lawmakers, and Ms. Sandberg\u2019s meetings this week were focused on fixing various problems facing the company.Ms. Sandberg, 48, knows her way in Washington, having worked here for years as a top aide in the Treasury Department. She is now regularly mentioned as a potential political candidate. That speculation increased in 2013 after the release of her first book, \u201cLean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.\u201d She was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and is a top Democratic donor.She has tried to deflect rumors about running for office, but they persist, and her appearance in Washington this week is unlikely to quell them. At her only public event in Washington, she gave smooth and measured answers to questions from Mike Allen, a co-founder of Axios, the online news start-up that hosted the event. The performance stood in stark contrast to efforts from Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, who usually appears far less comfortable in such situations \u2014 and who has also been mentioned as a potential political candidate.With House Intelligence Committee leaders who are investigating the company\u2019s role in foreign meddling in the election, Ms. Sandberg agreed to hand over a broader set of data linked to fake Russian accounts and to give more information about how that data was targeted to users. With top Republican and Democratic leaders of the House, she emphasized the company\u2019s desire to help with the investigation and promoted its plan to hire thousands of people to review ad purchases so the mistakes of the 2016 election are prevented from happening again.\u201cThey are leaning in on this issue,\u201d said Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation, alluding to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s book.\u201cThey have launched a platform that communicates around the world,\u201d Mr. Conaway said, \u201cand it\u2019s important for us to understand their perspective.\u201dIn a one-hour meeting Thursday with at least 17 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Ms. Sandberg delivered the same message and a peace offering.Ms. Sandberg responded with personal reflections. She said she was disappointed that Facebook ads had been used to sow racial division during the election, according to the caucus chairman, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, a Democrat from Louisiana. She told the caucus that she prayed daily that Facebook hadn\u2019t contributed to the outcome of the election, according to Representative G. K. Butterfield, a Democrat from North Carolina. And she promised that Facebook would appoint an African-American member to its board in the near future.\u201cI remain cautiously optimistic,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said after the meeting.When asked to comment on her day, Ms. Sandberg waved her hands and said: \u201cSorry, we\u2019re not talking. I need time for myself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U., Citing Amazon and Apple, Tells Nations to Collect Tax", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European competition regulators on Wednesday mounted a push against tax avoidance by Silicon Valley giants, announcing plans to take Ireland to court for failing to collect back taxes from Apple and ordering Luxembourg to claim unpaid taxes from Amazon.Officials in Europe have been particularly focused on flexing their regulatory muscles against American technology companies, including assessing penalties for antitrust violations and opening investigations into the mishandling of customer data.Critics have argued that the measures show that the European Union is unfairly targeting such companies \u2014 an accusation that officials in Europe deny.The moves to address tax avoidance have special resonance in the region, much of which has endured painful austerity measures stemming from the financial crisis. Opponents of those measures complain that big companies have skirted their tax obligations, leaving small firms and individuals to make up the difference.European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.A year later, \u201cIreland has not recovered any money, not even in part,\u201d she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid \u201cmore conflictual waters,\u201d a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.At the time of the ruling, Europe\u2019s competition watchdogs said that Apple\u2019s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\u201dThe Irish Department of Finance said that it \u201chas never accepted the commission\u2019s analysis\u201d in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager\u2019s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had \u201cmade significant progress on this complex issue\u201d and accused the European authorities of taking a \u201cwholly unnecessary step.\u201dApple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had \u201cno valid economic justification\u201d and that the company had been able to \u201cavoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.\u201dAmazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.\u201cWe believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it \u201cpaid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\u201dAmazon said it would study the commission\u2019s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to \u201cillegal state aid.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. \u201cThe main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.\u201dA broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.\u201cThere are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,\u201d Mr. Fuest said.The European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc\u2019s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries.Advertisement"}

But at some core human level, both are driven by fear of a future defined by outsiders, and a love for what is.I recognized the emotions I heard talking to bookstore owners and writers because it reminded me of the emotions I heard talking to working-class Americans as they struggled through the global financial crisis and its aftermath.

But beyond that academic analysis, in political debate in a polarized country, the word \u201cterrorism\u201d is also a verbal weapon, freely wielded \u2014 especially when the accused is Muslim.\u201cThe label is so powerfully pejorative and carries so much weight,\u201d said Martha Crenshaw, a terrorism expert at Stanford\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation.The first reports of any mass attack summon not only a general sense of grief, but anxieties and wishes in specific American subgroups: Muslim Americans pray that the attacker does not share their faith, for instance; conservatives and liberals alike want the assailant to turn out to be a member of their political opposition.\u201cIn today\u2019s political climate, it\u2019s so polarized that people are hoping it\u2019s not pinned on their side,\u201d Ms. Crenshaw said. As a political progressive, she admitted to a passing feeling of dread on Monday that the gunman might come from the left.More cynical observers of American politics may feel that Mr. Paddock\u2019s advanced age, white race and non-Muslim religious background make it less likely that he will be tagged a terrorist, whatever may emerge about his politics.And this gruesome tragedy, perhaps the deadliest single shooting episode in American history, quickly and predictably reopened a debate on gun control. If Mr. Paddock\u2019s purpose was uncertain, his choice of weapons was unmistakable.The tussle over what terrorism is dates back to the beginning of its modern history, said David C. Rapoport, the dean of American historians of terror. He said a Russian radical who shot the governor of St. Petersburg in 1878, Vera Zasulich, was asked at trial why she laid down her gun after merely wounding her target.\u201cI\u2019m not a criminal \u2014 I\u2019m a terrorist,\u201d she declared, he said, suggesting that she had made her political point and felt no need to pile on with lethal violence.\u201cThat\u2019s not our conception of terrorism,\u201d said Mr. Rapoport, a retired professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and founding editor of the journal Terrorism and Political Violence.Mr. Rapoport\u2019s well-known taxonomy identifies four major waves of terrorism since the 1880s: the anarchists; anticolonial activists; leftists around the time of the Vietnam War; and since 1979, religious zealots, including non-Muslims. He said each of the earlier waves lasted about 40 years, and that he expected the period of religious terrorism to fade by 2025.But in every case, the perpetrators had a clear ideological agenda. They were also overwhelmingly young, Mr. Rapoport said. Mr. Paddock so far seems to fit none of the patterns. His age, a year short of qualifying for Medicare, is especially perplexing.Still, the phenomenon of mass shooting, whether or not it properly carries the terrorist label in a particular case, is a recognizable American phenomenon. And from the point of view of potential victims, the crucial factor may not be a specific ideological motivation but the decision to target random, innocent people.Shooting down systematically from a hotel window on a crowd of 22,000 people enjoying a concert is a different matter, said John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State who studies terrorism. Even if that name does not apply, Mr. Paddock\u2019s baffling attack unquestionably spread terror far beyond Las Vegas.\u201cThe question people ask about this kind of violence is, Can I imagine myself in the situation of the victims?\u201d Mr. Mueller said. \u201cIn this case, the answer is absolutely yes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exploring the Necessity and Virtue of Sleep", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionMcGirr\u2019s is the more personal work of the two. Twenty years ago, he was diagnosed with sleep apnea, a condition in which one\u2019s slumber is repeatedly interrupted by temporary cessations in breathing. A night\u2019s testing in a sleep lab, with electrodes affixed to his scalp, chest and legs, revealed McGirr\u2019s case to be severe. He woke up 287 times, though he was unaware of these serial awakenings until his doctor informed him of them. McGirr\u2019s apnea was alleviated by a device known as a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) system, a nose-nozzle contraption that makes its wearer look a little like Darth Vader unmasked. Yet just as McGirr was poised to overcome a lifetime\u2019s worth of exhaustion, he and his wife, already the parents of a young son, had twins. The ensuing ordeal of irregular rest and ad hoc strategies to get some shut-eye (for parents and infants alike) prompted McGirr, a writer and teacher based in Melbourne, Australia, to ponder the very nature of sleep and wakefulness as human conditions.\u201cSnooze\u201d is the result of this pondering. A former Jesuit priest whose high-decibel snoring caused his colleagues no small amount of torment (\u201cI could make a monastery sound like a factory\u201d), McGirr pursues his chosen subject in a Jesuitical spirit of holistic inquiry, contemplating sleep as it has been considered in literature, science, history and his own experience. He turns, for example, to Charles Dickens, whose difficult relationship with sleep presented itself in both his nonfiction (his vivid 1861 essay \u201cNight Walks\u201d details the after-hours strolls he took through London as a restless younger man) and in his novels. Dickens\u2019s first, \u201cThe Pickwick Papers,\u201d features a character, Joe, who suffers from a form of sleep apnea, \u201ca fat and red faced boy in a state of somnolency who divided his time into small allotments of sleeping and eating.\u201dIn Thomas Edison, McGirr finds a forebear of today\u2019s tech entrepreneurs, a brilliant but arrogant man who regarded sleep and nightfall as nuisances to be vanquished. \u201cFor Edison, there were never enough hours in the day,\u201d McGirr writes. \u201cSo he made more.\u201d The long-lasting incandescent light bulb, which Edison perfected in 1879, was as much a profound upending of the natural order as it was a huge technological advance \u2014 the first step on the path to our current age of screen addiction, overlong workdays and sleep deficits.McGirr ranges far and wide in his considerations of sleep and sleeplessness, from his esoteric take on classical Greco-Roman literature (\u201cIf \u2018The Odyssey\u2019 is a book about getting home to bed, \u2018The Aeneid\u2019 is a book about getting out of it\u201d) to the story of an Australian woman who died after taking the anti-insomnia drug zolpidem, marketed as Stilnox in her country and as Ambien in ours. But these varied pens\u00e9es are rather randomly sequenced and don\u2019t hang together especially well. \u201cSnooze\u201d is no snooze, and in its best moments is a reflection of its author\u2019s evident intellect and charm. But it becomes rather drifty and slack as it progresses, building to no particular climax or conclusion.\u201cWhy We Sleep,\u201d by contrast, is a book on a mission. Walker is in love with sleep and wants us to fall in love with sleep, too. And it is urgent for him. He makes the argument, persuasively, that we are in the midst of a \u201csilent sleep loss epidemic\u201d that poses \u201cthe greatest public health challenge we face in the 21st century.\u201dWalker is no dilettante. He presides over Berkeley\u2019s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab, where he and his team, along with their peers at other institutions, have made significant strides over the last 20 years in understanding the restorative powers of sleep, and, correspondingly, the dire consequences of not getting enough of it. The upshot: \u201cSleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day \u2014 Mother Nature\u2019s best effort yet at contra-death.\u201d Someone should put that last phrase on a T-shirt.As information-dense as \u201cWhy We Sleep\u201d is, Walker is adroit at presenting his findings and their implications in language accessible to the lay reader. A healthy night\u2019s sleep lasts about eight hours, and is divided between REM (rapid-eye movement) sleep, in which the brain is as active as it is when its owner is awake, and NREM (non-REM) sleep, a deeper sleep state that predominates in the first half of the night. Both of these states (and there are further sub-states within NREM sleep) serve a multitude of purposes. NREM sleep, for example, is crucial to memory retention, and to acquiring and refining our motor skills. REM sleep plays a role in our abilities to overcome negative feelings, read other people\u2019s emotions and solve problems.Like McGirr, Walker observes that the last 100-odd years of industrialization, urbanization and purported progress have been hell on sleep. Only in his case, he has all manner of statistics and clinical studies to back him up. It really is true that you\u2019ll have a harder time falling asleep after reading a book on an LED device than you will after reading one printed on old-fashioned paper; the blue light emitted by an iPad suppresses your brain\u2019s natural release of melatonin, the hormone that induces sleepiness, by over 50 percent. Then there are the deleterious effects that sleep deprivation has on such physiological functions as the brain\u2019s regulation of blood pressure; per Walker, adults aged 45 and older who get fewer than six hours of sleep a night are 200 percent more likely to suffer a heart attack or a stroke than those who get their full sleep allotment.One especially winning attribute of Walker is that he\u2019s not a scold. He frames his suggestions for more healthful sleep habits not as a series of eat-your-Wheaties admonitions, but as wondrous, uplifting improvements in quality of life. (Among the most simple and effective: \u201cEstablish a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends.\u201d) And he offers attaboy praise to companies that have evolved out of the machismo-infused all-nighter ethos of yore and into a more enlightened approach to employee wellness. Nike and Google come in for kudos for incorporating \u201cnap pods\u201d into their offices and for having adopted a more flexible approach to employee work hours, acknowledging that some people are \u201cmorning larks,\u201d naturally disposed to rise and do their best work early, while others are \u201cnight owls,\u201d more inherently inclined to thrive on the late shift.Very occasionally, Walker\u2019s zeal tips into zealotry. He implies that women should abstain completely from alcohol consumption during pregnancy, noting that just a glass or two of wine will temporarily inhibit a fetus\u2019s REM sleep and that \u201cevery hour of REM sleep appears to count\u201d \u2014 a speculation that gives short shrift to the expectant mom and the benefit that a moment\u2019s relaxation might bring her. But, generally, \u201cWhy We Sleep\u201d mounts a persuasive, exuberant case for addressing our societal sleep deficit and for the virtues of sleep itself. It is recommended night-table reading in the most pragmatic sense.David Kamp is a contributing editor for Vanity Fair.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Self-Driving Race, Waymo Sets Its Own Terms", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftATWATER, Calif. \u2014 A self-driving car is not a self-driving car is not a self-driving car.That is the message Waymo, the autonomous vehicle division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, tried to send on Monday, when it invited a group of reporters to visit Castle, a facility in California\u2019s Central Valley that it has been using as a training course for its self-driving vehicles.Castle, which is built on a decommissioned Air Force base roughly 120 miles from San Francisco, resembles a miniature city, with many of the realistic elements a self-driving car might encounter on the road \u2014 like cul-de-sacs, traffic signals and a smattering of potholes. Waymo has been putting its test vehicles through their paces here since 2013, and conducting some 20,000 tests of different road situations. And on Monday, the company was offering rides in its latest prototype, a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with a cluster of sensors and cameras.But first, John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, wanted to give a vocabulary lesson.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about self-driving,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion about what the terminology means.\u201d He rattled off a list of terms that have been used to describe vehicles with varying levels of self-driving ability: autonomous, driverless, semiautonomous, fully self-driving, partially autonomous, semi-driverless.\u201cIt\u2019s really a bit of a problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.If Mr. Krafcik seems annoyed, it\u2019s because the self-driving hype cycle is running at full volume these days, with companies from Uber to General Motors to Tesla noisily promoting their progress toward autonomous vehicles.It\u2019s hard to know where this all ends. Will the winner be the company that develops a vehicle capable of driving along a preprogrammed route, in ideal weather conditions, in certain cities? Or will it be the vehicle that can drive itself anywhere, rain or snow? Is it enough to build a vehicle that drives itself most of the time, or is a truly driverless car one in which the passenger can safely take a nap? Does it count if a company produces just a handful of expensive prototype vehicles, rather than something that can be mass-produced and sold by the tens of thousands?Waymo has set a narrow target. It is aiming for Level 4 autonomy, an official classification for a vehicle that is capable of driving itself, with no human behind the wheel, in most environments and road conditions. It believes that nothing short of Level 4 counts as autonomous, and that bypassing Level 3 (a lower classification, in which some human attention is still required) is necessary to keep people safe on the roads. Humans, the company says, can easily lose concentration while driving with Level 3 autonomy, even though they often need to take over at a moment\u2019s notice.That is also a self-serving goal. By most estimations, Waymo is closer than any other company to Level 4 autonomy. Its test vehicles, which have been on the road for eight years, have completed more than 3.5 million autonomous miles, far more than any of its competitors. It has driven another 2.5 billion miles in \u201cCarcraft,\u201d a simulated, virtual-reality environment that allows the company to run and rerun various situations millions of times a day, and incorporate the results into its real-world vehicles. And its access to Google\u2019s top-tier engineering talent and cutting-edge technical infrastructure has made it a formidable competitor.Waymo\u2019s advantage was apparent on Monday, during my test ride in the company\u2019s self-driving minivan. Unlike other driverless demos I\u2019ve encountered, there was no human keeping watch at the wheel. To start the trip, a colleague in the back seat pressed a large blue button marked \u201cstart ride,\u201d and the van took off on its own. In a 10-minute drive around Castle, it easily handled a series of different on-road situations and obstacles. It encircled a roundabout, waited patiently for pedestrians to cross the street, and dodged traffic cones and bicyclists with ease. It felt slick and polished, and gave the sense that it might be ready for public consumption very soon.Granted, this was a carefully planned test loop in a controlled environment. Autonomous driving on public roads is a much harder challenge, and Waymo is still figuring out how best to deploy its technology to a wider market. The company declined to put a date on when it might release self-driving cars to the general public, and Mr. Krafcik spoke only in generalities about its plans, saying that it would focus on ride-hailing and autonomous trucking as possible early business models.\u201cWe\u2019re really close,\u201d he said.Waymo\u2019s victory against this army of well-funded competitors is not guaranteed. But it won\u2019t be easy to beat, especially if it gets to define what winning means.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad and Nicole\u2019s Week in Tech: Russia, Russia Everywhere", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsThe Russians created Facebook pages that had names like \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d and \u201cBlacktivist,\u201d and they populated their pages with videos and memes created by Americans \u2014 for instance, a hoax story about Muslim men collecting welfare checks for multiple wives. I found the story fascinating because the whole thing is so banal. You have this picture of foreign spies using James Bond-type technology to go after an enemy\u2019s political system. Nope, turns out they went about it exactly how you or I might do it \u2014 they found some videos online and posted them on Facebook.Here I should mention that some two dozen American federal agencies used Kaspersky\u2019s software, including some of the most critical agencies like the Department of Energy, which oversees our nuclear program. Kaspersky was so thoroughly \u201cowned\u201d by the Israelis, that nearly a year later when Kaspersky\u2019s researchers discovered the intrusion, its own researchers called the Israeli attack code \u201cthe best we have ever seen.\u201dAs it turns out, the Israelis were so deep inside Kaspersky\u2019s systems that they watched \u2014 in real time \u2014 as Russian spies used Kaspersky\u2019s systems effectively as a Google search box for American classified government programs. The Israelis caught Russian spies searching any computer that contained Kaspersky\u2019s software for the words \u201cTop Secret,\u201d in a sense abusing Kaspersky\u2019s deep access to the innards of more than 400 million people\u2019s machines to search for American government classified programs.In at least one case, the spies struck gold: They discovered a trove of highly classified National Security Agency programs on an agency employee\u2019s personal computer. Apparently the employee had installed the Kaspersky software on his home computer, not knowing that in doing so he was giving Russians full access to some of the N.S.A.\u2019s most coveted programs for penetrating foreign networks.Israel was able to capture all of this in real time and provided the N.S.A. with evidence in the forms of screenshots and other documentation, which is how the N.S.A. learned the source of this particular leak. The tip also prompted tons of internal discussions and studies within the United States intelligence community, which eventually led to a government ban on Kaspersky products last month.There are still some possible technical explanations for how Russia could have used Kaspersky as a backdoor without Kaspersky\u2019s knowledge. But most counterintelligence experts, including one we quoted from the Central Intelligence Agency, insist there is no way these kinds of broad scans for United States intelligence could have been conducted without Kaspersky\u2019s knowledge.And even if Kaspersky was not complicit, these experts say, that would still mean Kaspersky is either grossly incompetent or horrendously compromised. As a security company, neither is optimal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "High School Students Explain Why They Protest Anthems and Pledges", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "Supported byColin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to sit or take a knee during the national anthem exploded into a national conversation about race. Here, high school students tell us why they sit or kneel during the national anthem or the Pledge of Allegiance \u2014 or why they stand and participate. In August, 2016, the National Football League quarterback Colin Kaepernick began sitting, and then kneeling, during the national anthem before games as a protest against racist treatment of black people in the United States. His gestures created a new front in the national conversation about race, policing and patriotism. We asked high school students to tell us why they sit or kneel during the national anthem or Pledge of Allegiance, or why they stand and recite the words. Here is what they had to say. My first reaction to seeing Colin Kaepernick kneeling was: Why did he do this? And what does it mean to him? I Googled it, I looked on social media, I talked to my parents. One thing my mom said to me is that I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about this so much if it didn\u2019t mean a lot to me. It was bothering me that I was thinking about not kneeling because it\u2019s one of those things where I can\u2019t sit back and watch everything happen and not say something about it. There was a lot of hate that went around. Some of the football players received death threats and people saying it was disrespectful to kneel. It went around a lot more than we anticipated. So many other people were posting it. It was getting hundreds of thousands of likes, so a lot of people had a lot to say. The football players were scared. I was scared. We didn\u2019t expect it to get so big, and we didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I\u2019m happy with it. I\u2019m proud of myself for standing up for something I believe in, even if other people don\u2019t. The people who know why I did it, I want them to know they\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s a lot scarier to do something by yourself than when you have people doing it with you. I really choose to stand to show respect to everyone who is in service, who is on duty at the moment. They give so much and they get so little. The national anthem, the pledge, it\u2019s all showing respect to people doing their duty overseas in order for us to have the freedom to protest. My dad and my brother both served in the army, and I\u2019m trying to go into the Navy SEALs. People coming back from the war and facing personal issues, this probably makes them feel so low. I think the kids kneeling in high schools are following a trend. There are only a few who will actually dedicate their time to this subject. All the kids like to follow the trends. They probably don\u2019t really reason with what they\u2019re doing. They feel like it\u2019s cool to follow along. At our homecoming in October, one other person in my grade, a person in the grade above me, and I decided to kneel for the national anthem. That was the only time we had the anthem before the game. We all identify as black males. It was a bit interesting that we were the only ones who did it. The first time, there were eight of us. It\u2019s been that number consistently. We\u2019ve done it at three games. We wrote an email to the athletic director in our school on behalf of three of us who had interest. We weren\u2019t asking for permission since it\u2019s a constitutional right, but we wanted to keep everybody on the same page. I have no connection to religion whatsoever. The fact that they added the \u201cunder God\u201d part to the Pledge of Allegiance doesn\u2019t represent me, and it doesn\u2019t represent others who do not have religious affiliations. There are things you can do besides saying the pledge to show that you support this country even if it might not support you. My mom is a public-school teacher. For her, it\u2019s helping others get a public-school education. For me, it\u2019s standing up for the rights that the country has promised to protect \u2014 I went to the Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C. I think that while racism is erased from the laws, women have rights and the laws prohibit racial bigotry, that doesn\u2019t mean it is not abundant in society. You can still see very clear examples of this when you read the news. For example, if you look at the Las Vegas shooter, who was white, most of the headlines I see describe the shooter as the \u201cleast expected to do this,\u201d or \u201che was a humble man,\u201d or \u201che was a nice neighbor.\u201d But shooters of other races immediately get the label of what they are, these people are terrorists, these people are murderers. While this man, who caused one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history, is given a humane perspective.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a high school student who spoke about not standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.

Big Tech Companies Post Glowing Quarterly Profits", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut back on their home turfs, it is business as usual, as earnings reports from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, demonstrated on Thursday. All displayed the kinds of performances that make investors happy: profit surges, big jumps in revenue \u2014 sometimes both.If revenue growth is a good indication of giving the public what it wants, customers appear to love what the biggest technology companies are offering, whether it\u2019s cheap online storage, clothing or a social network, and the party isn\u2019t slowing down.But to a different audience \u2014 regulators, competitors, academics \u2014 the continued show of strength by big technology companies is a further sign of the risks of their getting bigger, even if there does not appear to be much of an appetite to do anything about it in the United States.\u201cI do not see, to be honest, anything between Amazon and a trillion-dollar market valuation except D.C. and Brussels, and at this point it looks more likely that it\u2019s Brussels,\u201d Mr. Galloway said, referring to the headquarters of the European Union.Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company\u2019s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.Amazon\u2019s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.The most remarkable sign of Amazon\u2019s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.Next week, Google\u2019s top lawyer, along with general counsels from Facebook and Twitter, will testify in front of lawmakers investigating how Russia used social media and technology platforms in the United States to influence the 2016 election.But as Alphabet reported another blockbuster earnings result on the back of strong sales of search advertising, the inquiry and any potential fallout were not discussed.On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google\u2019s pending appearance before Congress.Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share \u2014 surpassing Wall Street\u2019s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue \u2014 up 24 percent \u2014 while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company\u2019s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company\u2019s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion \u2014 or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.But in the past several years, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.Microsoft executives credited much of the company\u2019s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft\u2019s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.While Microsoft\u2019s attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment \u2014 its foray into making smartphones was a bomb \u2014 its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.Advertisement"}

W. Norton & Company, is facing accusations that passages in her new memoir, \u201cPoetry Will Save Your Life,\u201d are plagiarized.\u201cMy rule is, check basic facts when finishing a review,\u201d Mr. Logan wrote in an email on Wednesday. \u201cTake nothing on trust.\u201dThe academy\u2019s page says: \u201cBorn on November 13, 1850, in Edinburgh, Scotland, Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson came from a long line of prominent lighthouse engineers. During his boyhood, he spent holidays with his maternal grandfather \u2026 Prone to illness, Stevenson spent many of his early winters in bed, entertained only by \u2026 love of reading, especially William Shakespeare \u2026 and \u2018The Arabian Nights.\u2019\u201dMs. Bialosky wrote: \u201cRobert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on November 13, 1850. He came from a family of lighthouse engineers. During his boyhood he was prone to illness and spent many of his childhood winters in bed, entertained by reading Shakespeare and The Arabian Nights.\u201dAfter seeing that, Mr. Logan said, he checked entries on other poets.In a statement on Thursday, Ms. Bialosky, 60, said: \u201cWilliam Logan has extracted a few ancillary and limited phrases from my 222-page memoir that inadvertently include fragments of prior common biographical sources and tropes after a multiyear writing process. This should not distract from the thesis of this book, which derives from my own life, my experiences and observations. I will, of course, correct any errors that are found for future editions of the book.\u201dAt W. W. Norton, an independent publisher, Ms. Bialosky is a vice president and executive editor, overseeing the company\u2019s large and well-regarded trade poetry catalog, publishing such established poets as Rita Dove, Adrienne Rich and Marie Howe, along with younger poets including Major Jackson, Adam Fitzgerald and Meghan O\u2019Rourke.\u201cJill Bialosky is a trusted, longtime colleague and editor who has always done an outstanding job with her list of trade books at Norton,\u201d John Glusman, the editor in chief at W. W.

We stand by the book and are ready to work with the author to make any necessary corrections for future editions of the book.\u201dOf the eight instances that Mr. Logan cited in his review, one in particular stands out.Her section about the poet Robert Lowell reads: \u201cAlthough Lowell\u2019s manic depression was a great burden for him and his family, the exploration of mental illness in his verse led to some of his most important poetry, particularly as it manifested itself in Life Studies. When he was fifty, Lowell began taking lithium to treat his mental illness.\u201dOn Wednesday Mr. Logan said, \u201cHer borrowing seemed limited to three sites generally at the top of Google searches, though I later found a parallel passage in one of Helen Vendler\u2019s books.\u201dAllegations of plagiarism are not uncommon.Chris Harrick, a vice president at Turnitin, an academic integrity company that helps educators detect plagiarism, reviewed some of the passages of Ms. Bialosky\u2019s work that Mr. Logan flagged, and called the writing \u201cproblematic\u201d and \u201ccertainly unoriginal.\u201dThere are different types of plagiarism, he said. And although the memoir writer does not appear to identically clone entire passages, he said, she does appear to crib sentences and add slight edits \u2014 the kind of find-and-replace plagiarism more common among sophisticated, professional writers.\u201cThe chance of me and you sitting down, writing on the same subject and writing the same 10 words down is infinitesimal,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about a reviewer\u2019s accusations of plagiarism in a memoir by the poet Jill Bialosky included an outdated description of the response by the book\u2019s publisher, Atria Books, and its editor in chief, Peter Borland. It was not the case that Mr. Borland failed to respond to requests for comment. After a version of the article was published online Wednesday evening, Atria\u2019s parent company, Simon & Schuster, made a statement on Thursday night: \u201cJill Bialosky is a highly regarded editor and author who, in \u2018Poetry Will Save Your Life,\u2019 has written a unique and critically acclaimed memoir.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Entrepreneurs Squirm Under Xi Jinping\u2019s Tightening Grip", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Guo Junwen was a successful property developer in southwestern China when the authorities threw him behind bars three years ago on charges involving land use and seized his business.Now free, Mr. Guo \u2014 who still disputes the charges \u2014 says the police are refusing to return money they still owe him under Chinese law.\u201cThey said, \u2018We have no choice, Old Guo,\u2019\u201d Mr. Guo said in a telephone interview from the Indonesian island of Batam, where he lives part time. \u201c\u2018We have no fight against you, but this is what the higher-ups want.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe central government\u2019s policy is very positive,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cBut what is key is the issue of enforcement. The gap between the central government and local governments is still quite large.\u201d\u201cClearly, there\u2019s been a willingness to let these guys flourish but, at the same time, a desire to neutralize them as an independent political force,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a founding partner of the Beijing-based research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.Analysts say the state intervention has resulted in entrepreneurs\u2019 losing confidence in China\u2019s future. Private-sector investment has been weak, and many tycoons have parked their money abroad should they run afoul of the government.Many others choose to simply lie low. \u201cThe savvy entrepreneurs have already worked out which way the wind is blowing,\u201d said Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun\u2019s chairman.Mo Shaoping, a prominent human rights lawyer who represents Guo Junwen, said many of his entrepreneur clients were insecure. Looming over them is the fear that the government might make them pay for their \u201coriginal sin\u201d \u2014 crimes including bribery and fraud related to actions they took before China more clearly codified what is legal and what is not.Mr. Mo is skeptical about the government\u2019s claim to protect entrepreneurs, citing the lack of enforcement of private property rights. \u201cIn reality, the implementation of it has been terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to wastepaper.\u201dMr. Guo was one of China\u2019s new generation of entrepreneurs. In 1990, he toured the United States and was struck by its trappings of middle-class comfort. After that trip, he set up a computer company.He set up a real estate company in 1993 and moved into hotel management four years later, owning four hotels across China. His company, Chongqing Xiya Industrial Group, employed more than 3,000 people.He also built ties to government officials, but he felt he could not bridge the deep mistrust.\u201cSome officials who encounter entrepreneurs avoid us like we are the god of plague,\u201d Mr. Guo said.His troubles began in 2008 after he sold a real estate project to a politically connected buyer in Kunming. That investor was angered at how poorly his business was doing and wanted to get back at Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Guo and his lawyers. Officials in Kunming did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Guo\u2019s account of the dispute could not be independently verified.In 2014, prosecutors in Kunming impounded the company\u2019s hotels and real estate projects. In 2015, a court convicted Mr. Guo for illegally occupying farmland and sentenced him to two years in prison, according to court documents. He lost an appeal but was released in January 2016 for time served.Zhang Dongshuo, Mr. Guo\u2019s other lawyer, said the asset seizure violated Chinese law because the court never convicted his client of fraud. Most of the assets have been returned to Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Guo said the authorities had not returned $450,000 in cash, six villas in Kunming and three apartments in Chongqing.A party member for more than three decades, before he went into business, Mr. Guo said he was encouraged by the government\u2019s talk about entrepreneur rights. He said he looked forward to the day the party would elevate businesspeople to be senior politicians, citing President Trump as an example.\u201cLook at Trump, a businessman who could even become president,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cFor us to be like America in recognizing the importance of entrepreneurs, I think we still need a little more time.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senators Demand Online Ad Disclosures as Tech Lobby Mobilizes", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain and two Democratic senators moved on Thursday to force Facebook, Google and other internet companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, after revelations that Russian-linked operatives bought deceptive ads in the run-up to the 2016 election with no disclosure required.But the tech industry, which has worked to thwart previous efforts to mandate such disclosure, is mobilizing an army of lobbyists and lawyers \u2014 including a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2014 to help shape proposed regulations. Long before the 2016 election, the adviser, Marc E. Elias, helped Facebook and Google request exemptions from the Federal Election Commission to existing disclosure rules, arguing that ads on the respective platforms were too small to fit disclaimers listing their sponsors.Now Mr. Elias\u2019s high-powered Democratic election law firm, Perkins Coie, is helping the companies navigate legal and regulatory issues arising from scrutiny of the Russian-linked ads, which critics say might have been flagged by the disclaimers. In a two-front war, tech companies are targeting an election commission rule-making process that was restarted last month and a legislative effort in the Senate.\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you they support this bill right now,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and the lead author of the proposed Honest Ads Act.But she and her co-author, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, urged the social media companies to take greater responsibility for the content that lands on their sites, including political ads and other content meant to sow discord or chaos. With Facebook and Google alone capturing an estimated 85 percent of all digital political ads, self-policing won\u2019t cut it, they said.\u201cThey have to realize the world has changed,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.Federal election law bars foreigners from spending money to try to influence United States elections.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served on the election commission from 2013 until this year. \u201cWe need to rethink all the exemptions for the internet because even if Facebook might not have known about the Russian advertising, they knew \u2014 and we all knew \u2014 that this was possible.\u201dThe new bill would require internet companies to provide information to the election commission about who is paying for online ads.The content and purchasers of the Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook and Google in 2016 \u201care a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Warner said.Yet government officials working on the investigations into the Russian-funded ads and the efforts to enact stricter disclosure requirements say Facebook and Google have been less than enthusiastic partners.And in the weeks leading up to the introduction of the Klobuchar-Warner-McCain bill, Facebook told congressional aides that it is too difficult to figure out if an ad is political or commercial because candidates are often changing messages and topics. The company added that with the sheer number of ads on the site, the engineering involved in identifying political ads would be extremely challenging.Around that time, both companies paid Perkins Coie to seek exemptions from the election commission to one of the few election rules that do apply to online political activity \u2014 that political ads placed on third-party websites contain disclaimers revealing who paid for them. The exemption requests, written by Mr. Elias, the head of Perkins Coie\u2019s political law practice, argued that it was impractical to require disclaimers on ads the size of those then being offered on Google and Facebook.Such disclaimers and other disclosure requirements might have helped deter the Russian-funded ads and other online efforts to meddle in the election, say advocates for stricter campaign finance rules. Mr. Elias went on to help lead research into Russian efforts to help Donald J. Trump and damage Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.It was \u201ckind of like the chickens coming home to roost,\u201d said Ms. Ravel, the former commissioner.She argued that since Facebook was not granted an exemption to the disclaimer requirements, it should have required advertisements to include disclaimers for the past half-dozen years. But referring to Mr. Elias, she said that \u201cthe savvy political insiders understand that there is not going to be any enforcement from the F.E.C.\u201d because the commission has frequently deadlocked along partisan lines over enforcement matters in recent years.Mr. Elias rejected suggestions that he helped Russia hurt Mrs. Clinton.\u201cRussia found a number of ways to aid Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, and the F.E.C. disclaimers would not have stopped them,\u201d he said. The ads in question would not have required the disclaimers, he said, because \u2014 according to Facebook \u2014 they did not explicitly mention Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton or the election. In a blog post, Facebook wrote that the ads focused on amplifying \u201cdivisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201dCiting United States intelligence findings that Russia was behind the hacking and dissemination of damaging emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Mr. Elias said, \u201cThe Russians were willing to break the law to help Donald Trump. I doubt the F.E.C. disclaimers were going to be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201dCritics are not accepting that. Google and Facebook had ample opportunity to work with the Federal Election Commission to devise and put in place effective and practical disclaimer rules, \u201cbut they were silent,\u201d said Lawrence M. Noble, a former general counsel for the election commission who now serves in that position with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that pushes for stricter rules governing money in politics.\u201cAnd they are still trying to avoid regulation,\u201d Mr. Noble said.A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.And the company\u2019s vice president for United States public policy, Erin Egan, said, \u201cWe look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution\u201d to \u201cachieve transparency in political advertising.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hundreds of Mysterious Stone \u2018Gates\u2019 Found in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Desert", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle Earth has unlocked the gates to ancient mysteries around the world.Now, archaeologists have uncovered nearly 400 previously undocumented stone structures they call \u201cgates\u201d in the Arabian desert that they believe may have been built by nomadic tribes thousands of years ago.\u201cYou can\u2019t see them very well from the ground level, but once you get up a few hundred feet, or with a satellite even higher, they stand out beautifully.\u201dThe most well-known of the basalt boulder structures are the \u201ckites,\u201d which were first identified by air pilots in the 1920s. Each looks like a child\u2019s kite, complete with strings and long fluttering tails that are two-dimensionally flattened into the ground.Archaeologists think ancient nomadic tribes used the kites, which can be more than a mile long, for hunting. The structure\u2019s two long converging walls would funnel stampedes of gazelles into the body of the kite, where they would be slaughtered.But the lava fields extend beyond Jordan\u2019s borders into countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia. So do their mysteries. Saudi Arabia in particular offers a wealth of harrats that are just out of Dr. Kennedy\u2019s reach.\u201cWe would have loved to fly across into Saudi Arabia to take images. But you never get the permission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then along comes Google Earth.\u201dThen in 2008 he returned to the same spot from his desktop computer.\u201cWhen I saw the updated images of Harrat Khaybar from Google Earth, I was literally stunned and could not sleep that night,\u201d Dr. Al-Saeed said in an email. \u201cFlying like a bird all over the Harrat from one enigmatic structure to another! How come we passed by these structures without appreciating their design?\u201dHe spoke to his colleagues, and they set out to investigate the most striking structure they saw in person. The Harrat Khaybar was more than 550 miles from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. So they took a plane to a nearby city, rented a car and set out for the volcanic domes. In order to navigate the rocky terrain, they had to do much of their exploration on foot through the lava field.\u201cThe question we always discuss while investigating them is, why here? Why in this stony, frightful, rugged land?\u201d he said.

Suddenly, he was confronted with structures quite different from anything he had ever seen before. He called them gates because when looked at horizontally, they resemble a simple fence with two thick upright posts on the sides connected by one or more long bars.\u201cThey don\u2019t look like funerary, for disposing of dead bodies. They don\u2019t look like structures where people lived, and they don\u2019t look like animal traps,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they are.\u201d\u201cMore will be found as more people get involved in scouring the landscape from satellite imagery,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are many other features that have only recently been understood as forming classes of prehistoric \u2018geoglyphs\u2019 that were widespread in an area thought to be very barren and devoid of human impact,\u201d he said in an email.He added that he would have liked to have seen some suggestions from Dr. Kennedy as to what the gates may have been used for, if only to dissuade people from speculating as to extraterrestrial origins, as they have regarding the Sphinx and the Nazca Lines in Peru.Still, the new findings tell of a time when the climate and ecology of Saudi Arabia was most likely much different from today, he said. Given the differences, \u201cthe mind of people in the past is not that easily read.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The meetings are a part of the company\u2019s lobbying and public relations push to contain fallout from disclosures that a group linked to Russia bought more than $100,000 in ads on divisive issues on Facebook.Lawmakers and public interest groups have called for the release of the ads, which Facebook shared with Congress last month, to understand what kind of material foreign buyers placed in front of Facebook users.

In 2007, his major traveling retrospective opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and he joined the Gagosian Gallery poised at the pinnacle of the art market.The show includes the pairing of Soga Shohaku\u2019s 1763 \u201cDragon and Clouds,\u201d a 35-foot-long ink painting of a comically expressive dragon thrashing its tail through the clouds, with Mr. Murakami\u2019s never-before-exhibited 2010 reinterpretation done at almost twice the length. This was executed on a dare from Mr. Tsuji, issued in a series of articles called \u201cBattle Royale! Japanese Art History\u201d published in the magazine Geijutsu Shincho from 2009-11, when Professor Tsuji picked themes and Mr. Murakami had to make works in response. For one, the scholar chose Shohaku\u2019s dragon and goaded the artist to paint something by himself rather than rely on his army of assistants.\u201cI was so annoyed by his challenge,\u201d said Mr. Murakami, who had first seen the Shohaku image reproduced in Professor Tsuji\u2019s 1970 book \u201cLineage of Eccentrics\u201d tracing the wild originality of six artists from the Edo period (1615-1868), a volume that Mr. Murakami had found inspirational as a young artist.\u201cI decided to place a bind on myself and just do the whole thing in one go within 24 hours,\u201d Mr. Murakami said, \u201celiminating the process of meticulously designing and going straight to the canvas as if I were drunk.\u201dMr. Murakami\u2019s \u201cDragon in Clouds \u2014 Red Mutation\u201d mimics the sweet google-eyed personality and physical dynamism of Shohaku\u2019s dragon and his splashing of pigment against the surface of the paper, so different from Mr. Murakami\u2019s sleek trademark hard-edge forms.\u201cTakashi has interpreted this in a very expressionistic way that I find tremendously exciting,\u201d said Ms. Morse, who collaborated with Professor Tsuji for over a decade in cataloging the museum\u2019s thousands of objects of Japanese art, including the Shohaku collection. \u201cTakashi sees himself as a spiritual heir following on Shohaku,\u201d she added.While Mr. Murakami finds his dragon embarrassing technically, he said, \u201cit led me to approach my own limit and begin making this series of massively scaled paintings that without my communication with Professor Tsuji would not have happened.\u201d\u201cThat painting I feel is one answer I can give to Professor Tsuji,\u201d said Mr. Murakami, to show him \u201cthat I humbly received the \u2018Lineage of Eccentrics,\u2019 digested it myself and added something that is completely different from what I received.\u201dMr. Tsuji called it a great honor to be a part of this creativity as an art historian. Through the magazine project \u201cwhich was filled with drama, unpredictability and nonsense,\u201d he said, \u201cI realized Murakami\u2019s genius, rare in an artist, in which he is able to assimilate wide knowledge from others and incorporate it into his works.\u201d\u201cWithout saying that Murakami wasn\u2019t interesting before, which I don\u2019t believe,\u201d Mr. Darling added, \u201cI do think that his relationship with Professor Tsuji has had a real noticeable impact on his career and his development.\u201dThe show at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston highlights works directly and generally inspirational to Mr. Murakami. He made an almost one-to-one copy of the conical lotus-shape base supporting a late-10th, early-11th century Buddha in the museum\u2019s collection and used it to prop up his own Buddha interpreted as an animation character in his sculpture \u201cOval Buddha Silver\u201d (2008). Mr. Murakami\u2019s golden multipanel \u201cKawaii \u2013 vacances (Summer Vacation in the Kingdom of the Golden)\u201d (2008), populated with a field of smiling flower faces, echoes the dazzling ornamentation of poppies on a gold ground in a 17th-century screen by the school of Tawaraya Sotatsu.In a large-scale work commissioned especially for this show, Mr. Murakami aims to please his teacher. It incorporates the eccentric depiction of natural phenomena, including a direct reference to Shohaku\u2019s screen \u201cTranscendent Attacking a Whirlwind\u201d (circa 1764) where a tornado resembles a serpent\u2019s coiled tail. Speaking while the piece was still in progress, Mr. Murakami confessed that it has been very difficult and he had not yet succeeded.\u201cI want to show Professor Tsuji that I have been studying all he have given me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this work to be that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The Plight of the Sea Otter", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Sea otters, once bountiful along the California coast, were virtually wiped out by fur traders in the 18th and 19th centuries.A population estimated at as high as 20,000 fell to mere dozens.Since coming under the protection of strict wildlife laws in 1977, the playful creatures have been rising in number, but with agonizing slowness.The most recent count in 2017 was 3,186, down 86 from a year before.It doesn\u2019t help that hundreds of sick and injured otters have been turning up dead or dying along the California coast.In 2016, California wildlife officials recorded the highest ever number of stranded otters, 474. That\u2019s up from 299 a decade earlier.The blooms occur naturally, but researchers believe they are being intensified by runoff that pushes waste and fertilizer into the Pacific. They release a toxin called domoic acid that winds its way through the marine life food chain.Melissa Miller, a Department of Fish and Wildlife veterinarian who has overseen hundreds of otter necropsies, said more research was needed to fully understand how domoic acid was harming the otter population.But she added, \u201cI think we can safely say domoic acid is a big deal in otters. The hard part is how big of a deal.\u201dOtters are regarded as a keystone species, which means they are essential components of their ecosystem.That they\u2019re struggling should sound alarm bells not only about potential harms to marine life, but to humans as well, wildlife experts say.\u201cI see them as sort of a proxy for the bigger issue of land-sea pollution,\u201d said Dr. Miller.And don\u2019t forget, she added, \u201cWe eat a lot of the same things that otters eat. And we clearly see that some of the things that otters are getting are associated with the food that they\u2019re eating.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)A benefit concert for Northern California fire victims is to be headlined by the Bay Area bands Dead & Company and Metallica.The concert will be held Nov. 9 at San Francisco\u2019s AT&T Park with tickets from $50 to $200.

{"Headline": "Reporting on Las Vegas, Pixel by Pixel", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring continuing investigations into major events, traditional reporting often relies in part on official statements from law enforcement officers. But in this case, faced with shifting reports, The New York Times wanted to try to establish a timeline independent of that offered by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The approach makes use of every available piece of data in a given set of video files: the videos themselves and every pixel we see in the images, but also the audio tracks and the metadata \u2014 timestamps, geolocation information \u2014 embedded in the files. The files can come from social media uploads or submissions from witnesses themselves (most cellphone videos log the hour, minute and second they were recorded in file data).The process can be as simple as comparing a video with Google Street View to identify camera location or extracting file data with a smartphone app \u2014 or as difficult as analyzing each frame of a video and the amplitude and frequency of every second of audio.For our video investigation on the Mandalay Bay shooting, published over the weekend, I gathered and annotated dozens of videos and audio clips recorded at various locations \u2014 inside the festival, at the hotel itself and on Las Vegas Boulevard and Giles Street, where the police responded and concertgoers fled. And I searched social platforms and downloaded clips that were verified by wire services, ending up with well over an hour of footage and two hours of police scanner and fire scanner audio.The bursts of gunfire, 12 in all, served as scaffolding for the timeline. And by analyzing and lining up the audio waveforms of 30 videos filmed by concertgoers, the Las Vegas police and bystanders, my colleague Barbara Marcolini and I reconstructed as closely as possible the complete 10 minutes of the assault.Traditional reporting and information-rich visuals and graphics provided additional clarity and precision. The journalists C. J. Chivers, Thomas Gibbons-Neff and David Botti \u2014 all former Marines \u2014 vetted audio of the gunfire. Mr. Botti and Jon Huang, a journalist in The Times\u2019s graphics unit, helped me count the number of bullets. Video and graphics editors Drew Jordan, Chris Cirillo and Nicole Fineman layered visuals over raw material to explain the evidence. And throughout the investigation, Times reporters in Las Vegas \u2014 Jennifer Medina, Julie Turkewitz, Adam Goldman, Mitch Smith and others \u2014 relayed information from on the ground.Our investigation uncovered several key pieces of information. Perhaps most crucially, we were able to approximate the very second the first bullet was fired.By using data of such variety and quantity, we were able to tell a different kind of story. The Times plans to pursue more like it \u2014 so stay tuned.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Law & Order True Crime\u2019 Episode 2: No Surprises", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLaw & Order True CrimeTake Erik Menendez. He\u2019s been losing his marbles since the murders, and not because he\u2019s obsessed with finding the real killer. As he speaks with Detectives Zoeller and Linehan in Tuesday\u2019s episode (and as Lyle eavesdrops from another room), he asks them: What would have happened if he\u2019d grabbed a gun from his parents\u2019 house the night of the murders and walked outside with it? Hypothetically, of course.\u201cYou thinking about hurting yourself, Erik?\u201d Linehan asks.\u201cNo, no, no, I was just curious,\u201d Erik says.No doubt the detectives are wondering whether he was also \u201cjust curious\u201d about what 15 shotgun blasts at close range would do to two human bodies.Erik is visibly struggling with the future he bought. Whenever he talks to Lyle, it\u2019s obvious his conscience is ready blow; he may also be struggling with his sexuality, as is hinted at several times. It\u2019s clear he needs to unburden.So what does he do? After first pointing the detectives directly to Dr. Oziel, his therapist since the Calabasas burglaries, he confesses the murders to Oziel as soon as he gets a chance. To Lyle, who could hardly have been shocked, Erik later explains: \u201cI had to tell somebody. I wanted to kill myself.\u201dYou don\u2019t say.Or take Lyle. As the detectives learn from one of Lyle\u2019s friends, Lyle had been dropping hints that he wanted to kill his father for a while \u2014 specifically for cheating on his mother. (Literally: \u201cI could kill him for what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said in a way that sounds more like suggestion than exasperation.)So what does he do? See above.Then there\u2019s Dr. Oziel\u2019s mentally unstable lover, Judalon Smyth (an ageless and bewigged Heather Graham). After Erik\u2019s confession, Dr. Oziel has Erik and Lyle come into his office to conduct a psychological assessment at the behest of Erik\u2019s lawyer in the Calabasas ordeal, Gerald Chaleff (Michael B. Silver). Lyle isn\u2019t keen on what\u2019s happening, not least of all the fact that it\u2019s all being tape-recorded. He threatens Oziel, and Judalon catches wind.In a separate-but-soon-to-be-related thread, Oziel lets himself into Judalon\u2019s apartment for a little hanky-panky, only to find her in the kitchen \u2014 with her head inside the gas oven: Red Flag No. 1. (Oziel is Judalon\u2019s shrink, so it\u2019s probably Red Flag No. 1,000.) In what\u2019s probably the stupidest move we\u2019ve seen, Oziel decides it\u2019s a good idea to ask his wife if Judalon, whom she believes is merely a troubled patient, can stay in the guest room for a while. Runner-up in stupid moves: His wife agrees.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.And when things get all \u201cFatal Attraction,\u201d as of course they do, Judalon announces she\u2019ll tell the police about the Menendez confessions if \u201cDr. Daddy\u201d doesn\u2019t make her his one and only. This would not only be bad for the Menendezes, it would be bad for Oziel \u2014 patient confidentiality notwithstanding, Oziel sniffs opportunity, and he\u2019s billing the Menendezes accordingly. He also clearly relishes being at the center of the action. He calls his lover\u2019s bluff.So what does she do? You guessed it.Next we see, the cops are barging into Oziel\u2019s house to seize the confession tapes. Lyle is hauled out of a Jeep, thrown onto the asphalt and cuffed \u2014 but only after handing off his Rolex for safe keeping. Erik, who\u2019s in Israel for a tennis tournament, gets word of the arrest and flies home to turn himself in. (\u201cThis lawyer Robert Shapiro arranged it,\u201d he tells his aunt Marta, referring to the man who later became a household name for defending O.J. Simpson; how Shapiro got involved is never explained.)Into this vortex of human folly and predictability comes Leslie Abramson. With clients, she\u2019s gentle and nurturing, tending to their wounds both figuratively and literally. With opponents and fools, she\u2019s the Tasmanian Devil, whirling and sharp-toothed and dangerous to anyone in her path. That includes Bob Shapiro, whom she faults for having allowed Lyle to surrender without preconditions. It includes Ira Reiner, the local District Attorney, who\u2019s planning a run for state attorney general.She starts making quick work of both men right away: On advice from Chaleff, who can\u2019t take Erik\u2019s defense because of conflicts with Calabasas, Leslie appears to snatch the case from Shapiro, at least in any meaningful way. As for Reiner, his dull news conference announcing the arrests is immediately eclipsed by Leslie\u2019s. She\u2019s blindingly charismatic, and she does what all good defense lawyers do in the court of public opinion \u2014 particularly in Hollywood, where everyone loves a show: She makes the case about something bigger (and other) than murder.\u201cMr. Reiner, who wants to be our attorney general, is at war with the most basic social contract we have: the doctor-patient privilege,\u201d she says, referring to the seizure of the tapes.\u201cSomeone has to stop him,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd we will.\u201d Judging by the look on Reiner\u2019s face, he may be the first person we\u2019ve seen who\u2019s willing to take a stated threat seriously.Go ahead and Google the political fortunes of Ira Reiner: He probably still didn\u2019t take it seriously enough.Stray Fragments:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As \u2018Unicorns\u2019 Emerge, Utah Makes a Case for Tech Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipWhen Josh James traveled to the Bay Area in 2000, seeking funding for a web analytics company he had founded, he spoke at length with a venture capitalist about his plans for growth. The conversation was going well, Mr. James recently recalled, until the investor asked where he was based. \u201cAs soon as I told him I was from Utah, he literally, without saying a word, turned around and walked away.\u201dUtah entrepreneurs no longer get that icy response.The state has a thriving technology hub in the roughly 80-mile swath from Provo to Ogden, with Salt Lake City in between. The region has given rise to at least five companies valued at more than $1 billion. The concentration of these so-called unicorns is surpassed only by California, New York and Massachusetts, according to CB Insights, which tracks venture capital investment.Mr. James has even helped coin the name \u201cSilicon Slopes\u201d to brand the region \u2014 a wink at the Bay Area and a nod to the renowned ski areas in the state, home to the 2002 Olympics.\u201cFounders viewed their companies like they\u2019re building the family business or a farm \u2014 they\u2019re building them to keep,\u201d said Ryan Smith, the founder of Qualtrics, a data analytics company that focuses on surveys and other research for corporate and academic clients. \u201cWith no outside funding, there\u2019s no lifeline and you have to figure it out on your own.\u201dOne reason for the growth, said Mark Gorenberg, a venture capitalist with Zetta Venture Partners in San Francisco, is the emphasis that some start-ups have placed on data analytics \u2014 a growing field that has helped put the state on the map. E-commerce companies, as well as those specializing in medical devices and cloud computing, have also flourished.As the local tech community has grown, local venture capital firms have formed in the state, providing seed money as well as participating in later funding rounds. According to CB Insights, more than $2.6 billion has been invested in the 10 most well-funded companies in Utah.\u201cThe region transformed from a recreation area with some tech companies to a full tech ecosystem,\u201d said Mr. Gorenberg, whose firm has invested in three Utah-based companies.In a state where 59 percent of residents describe themselves as active Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a presence in the start-up scene as well. Many company founders are members, and while the church does not directly invest in individual companies, said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the church, the emphasis on family permeates many start-ups in the area.Some say the Mormon culture fosters a collaborative spirt among the area\u2019s tech community, and the founders of unicorns regularly get together. Last month, for example, several founders worked until 3 a.m. at Mr. Smith\u2019s home, organizing a January conference meant to coincide with the Sundance Film Festival in Utah \u2014 an effort to create a tech and entertainment conference similar to the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex.Mr. Smith\u2019s father, Scott, started Qualtrics in 2002 to help businesses measure customer and client satisfaction; the younger Mr. Smith joined the nascent company while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University after doctors diagnosed cancer in his father (who has since recovered). His older brother Jared, an executive at Google, joined several years later.The company, which has received funding from Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital and Insight Venture Partners, now has a valuation of $2.5 billion. Mr. Smith said it had annual revenue above $250 million, with corporate clients including Microsoft and Marriott International.At Pluralsight, a company focusing on tech training, the trajectory was similar. Aaron Skonnard, its chief executive, founded the company with three others, each putting in $5,000 to initially develop in-person training programs.The four traveled worldwide for their programs until Mr. Skonnard realized that it would be more efficient to train clients online; by 2011, the company had begun offering only virtual training, walking away from half of its $1.5 million in revenue. But the switch paid off. Pluralsight began receiving outside funding in 2012 from venture capital firms such as Insight Venture and Iconiq Capital. The company, now valued at more than $1 billion, estimated that revenues will reach $190 million this year.Now, the start-ups are dealing with the challenges to growth that others in tech face: recruiting new engineers and programmers, as well as seasoned executives.It is one area where the companies outwardly compete, especially as they seek to improve their diversity. And the hiring needs can be significant. Pluralsight, for example, this month announced plans to add 2,400 new jobs over the next decade and move from Farmington to a new campus south of Salt Lake City, closer to the other tech companies.The local universities have played an important role in fostering homegrown talent. Brigham Young, the private university affiliated with the Mormon Church, and the public University of Utah have programs intended to develop young entrepreneurs.But as demand for talent has grown, it has also meant companies have needed to recruit outside Utah.Their pitch often involves promoting the accessibility of outdoor activities, including hiking and skiing. Jaunts to Park City, the ski town, are common, and many choose to settle in that area. Besides, the office spaces of many of these companies typify the start-up ethos: abundant food, table tennis and pool tables, and, at Qualtrics, even an indoor basketball court.The companies also talk up the growth of their competitors, to assure recruits that many opportunities exist within the state if an employee \u2014 at any level \u2014 wants to make a move. There are more than 4,000 tech companies in the state, according to figures from the governor\u2019s office; Mr. James, who employs 810 people at Domo, sometimes suggests that those interviewing speak to others in the region.\u201cI want them to know that re-deployability isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d he said.The efforts have paid off, Mr. Smith said. This year alone, his company has hired 150 people who moved from outside the state.Joy Driscoll Durling, the chief information and digital enablement officer at Vivint Smart Home, was working at Adobe in California when she had the opportunity to move to Utah, where Adobe established offices after its acquisition of Omniture.\u201cNo one in my family could believe I was even considering it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut my family and I appreciate the outdoors.\u201dAnd while they briefly considered returning to the Bay Area, they have stayed because of both work-life balance and the career opportunities. In March, Ms. Durling left Adobe and joined Vivint, which provides home security and automation products.Apart from lifestyle, the potential for an initial public offering helps with recruiting \u2014 and legitimacy. Farrah Kim, a spokeswoman for CB Insights, said the best \u201cway to jump-start a start-up ecosystem is for a cluster of big exits to emerge,\u201d whether through deals or I.P.O.s.The public markets afford companies more capital for growth, whether organic or through acquisitions, Mr. James said. And, he added, an I.P.O. enhances a company\u2019s profile because it shows that the business has been vetted by bankers and lawyers.\u201cOne day, people think you\u2019re a cute entrepreneur,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re treated dramatically different once you\u2019re public.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trust Buster for the New \u2018Knowledge Monopoly\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionThe technology critic is typically a captive figure, beholden either to a sorrowful past, a panicked present or an arrogant future. In his proudest moments, he resembles something like a theorist of transformation, decline and creation. In his lowest, he is more like a speaking canary, prone to prophecy, a game with losing odds. His attempts at optimism are framed as counterintuitive, faring little better, in predictive terms, than his lapses into pessimism. He teeters hazardously between implicating his audience and merely giving their anxieties a name. He \u2014 and it is almost always a he \u2014 is the critical equivalent of an unreliable narrator, unable to write about technology without also writing about himself. Occasionally, he is right: about what is happening, about what should happen, and about what it means. And so he carries on, and his audience with him.Franklin Foer, thankfully, recognizes these pitfalls even if he can\u2019t always avoid them. Who can? The melodramatically titled \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d Foer\u2019s compact attempt at a broad technological polemic \u2014 which identifies the stupendous successes of Amazon, Google and Facebook, among others, as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the individual and to society \u2014 begins with a disclaimer. Foer\u2019s tumultuous stint editing The New Republic under the ownership of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes ended with mass resignations and public acrimony. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this experience informs the argument of this book,\u201d he writes. He is likewise entangled through his proximity to publishing: The author\u2019s friends, colleagues and immediate family members \u2014 including his brother, the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer \u2014 depend to different degrees on the industry Amazon consumed first. The book is dedicated to his father, Bert, a crusading antitrust lawyer.In this slightly crouched posture, and with a hint of healthy self-doubt, Foer proceeds quickly. We, the consuming public, have failed to properly understand the new tech superpowers, he suggests, leaving little hope for stodgy and reluctant American regulators. The scope of their influence is obscured by the sheer number of things they do and sell, or problems they purport to be solving, and by our outdated sense of what constitutes a monopoly. To that end, Foer promotes the concept of the \u201cknowledge monopoly,\u201d which he qualifies with a mischievous grin. \u201cMy hope is that we revive \u2018monopoly\u2019 as a core piece of political rhetoric that broadly denotes dominant firms with pernicious powers,\u201d he says, rather than as a \u201ctechnical\u201d term referring to one company cornerning a market. (His new monopolists, after all, aren\u2019t raising prices. They\u2019re giving things away free).For much of the book, readers are parachuted into various moments in the history of computing, the internet, media and philosophy. Character introductions arrive rapidly, with a casualness that can slip into absurdity: Descartes \u201cenjoyed his sleep\u201d; Mark Zuckerberg \u201cis a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just a little bit naughty\u201d; Alan Turing was an \u201catheist and a loner,\u201d while Ray Kurzweil, the prophet of an artificial-intelligence-driven singularity, is driven by his inability to escape \u201cthe biggest fear of them all.\u201d (Death.) The effect is slightly delirious but genuinely enjoyable. Readers are flung through a highly selective history of the philosophy of mind, landing squarely on their feet in Google\u2019s A.I. laboratories. The 17th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\u2019s stubborn and total belief that knowledge could be reduced to mathematical computation leads surprisingly seamlessly into a perceptive assessment of Zuckerberg\u2019s fraught and inconsistent public relationship with the concept of the algorithm, his mission to connect the world and the billions of meaningful decisions made by Facebook\u2019s software every day.As Foer\u2019s book veers into advocacy, readers are treated to a similarly energetic and cleareyed view of the modern \u201cknowledge monopoly\u201d giants. Jeff Bezos\u2019 techno-populist suggestion that he can \u201csee the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere\u201d is contrasted with his personal purchase of The Washington Post and his stewardship over Amazon, which is a massive, diverse and participatory marketplace, but one under the control of a single private company with a reputation for ruthlessness and strong-arm negotiation tactics. \u201cOld gatekeepers might not always have been worthy of praise,\u201d Foer writes, \u201cbut at least there were a lot of them.\u201dFoer\u2019s other concession to nostalgia, in the form of an inoffensive command to return to the \u201csustaining nourishment of the contemplative life and the deep commitment to text,\u201d is overshadowed by a vigorous and novel call for regulatory intervention. He reminds us that the issue of monopoly dominated our politics for generations, even as the companies in the crosshairs changed in form and ambition. Though he makes no radical or provocative case to, say, nationalize Facebook, or to break up Google, he does suggest creating a Data Protection Authority, in the mold of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s post-financial-crisis Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and calling for government to protect privacy as it (in theory) protects the environment.Is this idealistic, plain crazy, or just impotent? The armchair technology critic \u2014 roused by Foer\u2019s sneakily persuasive manifesto \u2014 might ask in response, with a mixture of satisfaction and despair: What does it mean that it could be all three?John Herrman covers media for The Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "With Literary Support, Xerox Asserts Its Modern Relevance", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingA 111-year-old company has turned to a 5,000-year-old medium to assert its relevance in an ever-changing workplace culture.Featuring 12 essays, short stories and even a song, the book includes new work by writers including Joyce Carol Oates, Gary Shteyngart and Lee Child; the poet Billy Collins; and the musicians Aimee Mann and Jonathan Coulton. Each of the works focuses on the workplace.The book is part of Xerox\u2019s \u201cSet the Page Free\u201d project, which benefits the 92nd Street Y and Worldreader, a nonprofit that promotes global literacy. The company\u2019s name appears in only a couple of works in the book, but some writers used Xerox equipment as they worked.Xerox spent decades as the Google of its generation (\u201cI\u2019m going to go Xerox this document\u201d). A Xerox copier was ubiquitous in office settings.\u201cThey had a cultural footprint as a brand that was pretty big and vivid,\u201d said Kevin O\u2019Neill, an advertising professor at Syracuse University.But the company has had to reinvent itself as other tech companies have caught up. Xerox was looking for a way to reinforce its longtime role as an essential part of office life while producing something culturally significant.The book, which will also be handed out in printed form to customers and clients, was the perfect tool for bridging the goals, said Toni Clayton-Hine, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cIt was a logical connection to what you knew of Xerox so far,\u201d she said. The company still provides copiers, printers and scanners, but it has branched out into cloud computing and translation software as well. \u201cWe wanted to show how Xerox is relevant to the workplace today.\u201dXerox gave the writers little guidance, Ms. Clayton-Hine said.\u201cWe took a leap of faith,\u201d she said. \u201cIn many respects, we weren\u2019t sure what we were going to get. What we got back was really fantastic.\u201dThe works include the humorous (Mr. Shteyngart recalls his first job, advertising piano lessons on a sandwich board in Union Square, surrounded by drug dealers) and the musical (Ms. Mann and Mr. Coulton muse on working from home: \u201cTried to Skype with the background clutter / Printer, mug and comb\u201d).In his poem, Mr. Collins, a former national poet laureate, remembers his father\u2019s downtown Manhattan office, calling it \u201can Avalon of supplies\u201d with an \u201coasis of the water cooler.\u201dThe 92nd Street Y, which hosts speakers, concerts and other events on the Upper East Side, recruited the artists. The writing was shepherded by Bernard Schwartz, director of the Y\u2019s Unterberg Poetry Center.\u201cThere is a unique thrill to coming to work and having in one\u2019s inbox new work from artists such as these,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said.Corporations have long sponsored cultural institutions and events, but the Xerox project continues a more recent trend toward commissioning art.Leaning on literature as a marketing tool shows that companies are eager to attract \u201cthe influentials,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. Commissioning works of art is far more significant than simply slapping a corporate name on someone else\u2019s event, he said.\u201cA key thing with managing a corporate reputation is not what you say, but what you do,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Neill, whose fiction has appeared in The New Yorker. \u201cI\u2019m always much more impressed when I see a corporation doing something like this.\u201dNostalgia was one of the reasons Mr. Shteyngart was drawn to the project.\u201cI probably would have been a little more skeptical if it had been the corporation that approached me rather than the Y,\u201d he said.The corporate ties didn\u2019t bother Ms. Oates, who said she viewed the book as just another anthology.\u201cI like to write,\u201d said Ms. Oates, a Princeton University professor, whose short story explores an awkward relationship between teacher and student. \u201cThe opportunity to write about work was inviting.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seeing Danger in a Face", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSan Francisco \u2014 Every day, American citizens are detained in windowless rooms at international airports with little to no scrutiny. I am not referring to airports in some foreign country; I am referring to our airports here in the United States. I know, because it happened to me.Earlier this month, I was returning to San Francisco from a trip to Armenia and Greece. Without a single question, but with careful scrutiny of my face and Middle Eastern features, an agent from the Department of Homeland Security at San Francisco International Airport ordered me to a room in the back of the terminal. As I headed to the detention area, I had many thoughts racing through my head. The biggest one, however, was practical: How does detaining, based on his appearance, a San Francisco prosecutor who has spent most of his professional career advancing public safety, make America safer?After about an hour of waiting, my interrogator came to ask me some questions. He asked me about my trip to Armenia, whether I had attempted to sneak into Turkey or Syria during my vacation, whether I had visited any refugee camps and whether I had joined any groups like ISIS. These are astoundingly ignorant questions. For one thing, I am an Armenian-American whose family escaped the Lebanese Civil War over 35 years ago. As a descendant of the Armenian Genocide, a genocide perpetrated by Turks, there is absolutely no logical reason I would sneak into Turkey from Armenia (especially since Turkey has blockaded that border). Furthermore, as an Armenian, I am a Christian, and as Armenians in Syria and Iraq have experienced, meeting with jihadist groups would have led to my kidnapping and possible beheading.It wasn\u2019t until some time into my questioning that the officer asked what I did for a living. I told him I was a prosecutor in the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office, a fact that could have been revealed with a simple Google search. My detention ended shortly after that information came to light. What never came to light, however, is why they detained me in the first place. They never gave me a straight answer, and I have very few avenues for recourse. My detention was well within the rules.The ham-handed nature of my interrogation is worth recounting, because it points to the nature of racial profiling, and its widespread use at our borders. Even if I had been a Muslim American, what connection would my appearance or religion have to my potential risk to national security?To answer that question, one must first try to understand why racial profiling occurs. It is born from misplaced and unjustified fear, among other more morally bankrupt reasons. That fear creates racist policies in our country, and not just at our borders: You can see it in the over-policing of predominantly African-American neighborhoods, the over-incarceration of African-Americans, the calls for mass deportations of Latino immigrants and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. In each case, one\u2019s identity, or skin color, or religion is taken as sufficient evidence of a dangerous intent. Some will try to disavow the racism by saying that these traits are simply a convenient proxy, but it amounts to the same thing. If you detain Muslims at the airport because of a stereotype about Muslims and terror, the problem isn\u2019t them.I am not saying there should not be extensive security at airports. As someone in law enforcement, I believe wholeheartedly that there should be. But the current policy of detaining people at airports based on the way they look is not only unconstitutional, it also fails to make us safe. Racial profiling fails all of us because we all know danger comes from people who can look like anyone. Profiling also loses the hearts and minds of the citizens the government is supposed to be working for. It begets the question: If my country does not love me, why should I continue to love my country? And if I as a public servant am beginning to have that question creep in my mind, what are others thinking on our streets and in our airports?I went back and forth about writing this. Perhaps, it would have been in my best interest to let the incident go. However, I\u2019ve been racially profiled at the airport before \u2014 and so have my brother, my father and most likely hundreds if not thousands of other American citizens who look just like me. I\u2019ve also been profiled in the streets. These experiences are part of why I became a prosecutor: to find a way to be part of the solution rather than complain about the problem. But these experiences are taxing. I can\u2019t change my face, I can\u2019t change my features, nor should I have to fly overseas in a tuxedo to make airport authorities feel more at ease.We are a nation of laws, and no policy should be above some level of accountability and scrutiny. And, at the very least, as an American citizen, I should be constitutionally entitled to know why I have been detained. The minute we stop being a nation of laws is when we no longer are the United States of America.Alex Bastian is the deputy chief of staff at the San Francisco District Attorney\u2019s Office and a native San Franciscan.Advertisement"}

That may prove true. But getting there is turning into a nightmare \u2014 a world where billions of people are connected but without sufficient legal structures, security protections or moral muscles among companies and users to handle all these connections without abuse.Lately, it feels as if we\u2019re all connected but no one\u2019s in charge.Equifax, the credit reporting bureau, became brilliant at vacuuming up all your personal credit data \u2014 without your permission \u2014 and selling it to companies that wanted to lend you money. But it was so lax in securing that data that it failed to install simple software security fixes, leaving a hole for hackers to get the Social Security numbers and other personal information of some 146 million Americans, or nearly half the country.Facebook, Google and Twitter are different animals in my mind. Twitter has enabled more people than ever to participate in the global conversation; Facebook has enabled more people than ever to connect and build communities; Google has enabled everyone to find things like never before.Those are all good things. But the three companies are also businesses, and the last election suggests they\u2019ve all connected more people than they can manage and they\u2019ve been na\u00efve about how many bad guys were abusing their platforms.As Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it to me, \u201cUp to now these companies have not taken the threat that Russia and other foreign agents pose to our system seriously enough or invested enough or to really reveal what happened in 2016 \u2014 or what is still happening now.\u201dLast November, Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg dismissed as \u201ca pretty crazy idea\u201d evidence that people were using Facebook to generate fake news to tip the U.S. election. Last week, after disclosing hundreds of Russia-linked accounts \u2014 where fictional people posing as U.S. activists spread inflammatory messages about immigration and guns and trashed Hillary Clinton and boosted Donald Trump \u2014 Zuckerberg admitted, \u201cCalling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it.\u201dOne reason Facebook was slow to respond is that its business model was to absorb all of the readers of the mainstream media newspapers and magazines and to absorb all their advertisers \u2014 but as few of their editors as possible. An editor is a human being you have to pay to bring editorial judgment to content on your website, to make sure things are accurate and to correct them if they\u2019re not. Social networks preferred to use algorithms instead, but these are easily gamed.Twitter\u2019s presentation, said Senator Warner, \u201cshowed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions.\u201d It was \u201cfrankly inadequate on every level.\u201dEvery week we are coming to realize that we do not know the depth of this Russian hacking \u2014 and that the people who did it were incredibly sophisticated, not only about the technology platforms but also about which districts and demographics to target with just the right inflammatory messages.America\u2019s democracy is built on two principles: truth and trust. We trust that our elections are fair and that enables our peaceful rotations of power. And we trust that the news we get from our mainstream outlets is true and that it is corrected if it is not. And we expect our president to defend both. But today many people are getting news from platforms that are easily polluted by Russian or other hackers with fake news. And our president is a liar who refuses to hold Russia to account for anything. It\u2019s a terrible combination.We can\u2019t fix Trump right now. But have Equifax and these big social networks become so much part of the wiring of our lives \u2014 and the impacts of their failures so consequential \u2014 that they should be regulated in new ways? I don\u2019t know, but I know it\u2019s time for this discussion. It\u2019s already started.Said Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, \u201cWe must update our laws to ensure that when political ads are sold online Americans know who paid for them.\u201dThese companies make billions selling our data, but they\u2019re ambivalent about taking responsibility \u201cfor the uses, and abuses, of their platforms,\u201d argued the Harvard political philosopher Michael Sandel. \u201cThey can\u2019t have it both ways. If they claim they are neutral pipes and wires, like the phone company or the electric company, they should be regulated as public utilities. But if, on the other hand, they want to claim the freedoms associated with news media, they can\u2019t deny responsibility for promulgating fake news.\u201dIn the early 20th century, added Sandel, \u201cthe rise of monopolies and concentrated economic power brought forth an era of progressive reform that regulated railroads, banks and utilities in the public interest. Today, we need a similar spirit of reform. These platforms are so dominant that, like electric wires or telephone lines, we can scarcely avoid using them. But when they allow our personal data \u2014 or elections \u2014 to be hacked, there\u2019s not much we can do about it.\u201d\u201cA century ago, we found ways to rein in the unaccountable power associated with the Industrial Revolution,\u201d concluded Sandel. \u201cToday, we need to figure out how to rein in the unaccountable power associated with the digital revolution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside a Secretive Group Where Women Are Branded", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Last March, five women gathered in a home near here to enter a secret sisterhood they were told was created to empower women.To gain admission, they were required to give their recruiter \u2014 or \u201cmaster,\u201d as she was called \u2014 naked photographs or other compromising material and were warned that such \u201ccollateral\u201d might be publicly released if the group\u2019s existence were disclosed.The women, in their 30s and 40s, belonged to a self-help organization called Nxivm, which is based in Albany and has chapters across the country, Canada and Mexico.Sarah Edmondson, one of the participants, said she had been told she would get a small tattoo as part of the initiation. But she was not prepared for what came next.Each woman was told to undress and lie on a massage table, while three others restrained her legs and shoulders. According to one of them, their \u201cmaster,\u201d a top Nxivm official named Lauren Salzman, instructed them to say: \u201cMaster, please brand me, it would be an honor.\u201dA female doctor proceeded to use a cauterizing device to sear a two-inch-square symbol below each woman\u2019s hip, a procedure that took 20 to 30 minutes. For hours, muffled screams and the smell of burning tissue filled the room.\u201cI wept the whole time,\u201d Ms. Edmondson recalled. \u201cI disassociated out of my body.\u201dBoth Nxivm and Mr. Raniere, 57, have long attracted controversy. Former members have depicted him as a man who manipulated his adherents, had sex with them and urged women to follow near-starvation diets to achieve the type of physique he found appealing.Now, as talk about the secret sisterhood and branding has circulated within Nxivm, scores of members are leaving. Interviews with a dozen of them portray a group spinning more deeply into disturbing practices. Many members said they feared that confessions about indiscretions would be used to blackmail them.Mark Vicente, a filmmaker and former top Nxivm official, said that after hearing about the secret society, he confronted Mr. Raniere.\u201cI said, \u2018Whatever you are doing, you are heading for a blowup,\u2019\u201d Mr. Vicente said.Several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group\u2019s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.Separately, a state police investigator told Ms. Edmondson and two other women that officials would not pursue their criminal complaint against Nxivm because their actions had been consensual, a text message shows.State medical regulators also declined to act on a complaint filed against another Nxivm-affilated physician, Brandon Porter. Dr. Porter, as part of an \u201cexperiment,\u201d showed women graphically violent film clips while a brain-wave machine and video camera recorded their reactions, according to two women who took part.The women said they were not warned that some of the clips were violent, including footage of four women being murdered and dismembered.\u201cPlease look into this ASAP,\u201d a former Nxivm member, Jennifer Kobelt, stated in her complaint. \u201cThis man needs to be stopped.\u201dMr. Raniere and other top Nxivm officials, including Lauren Salzman, did not respond to repeated emails, letters or text messages seeking comment. Dr. Roberts and Dr. Porter also did not respond to inquiries.Former members said that, inside Nxivm, they are being portrayed as defectors who want to destroy the group.It is not clear how many women were branded or which Nxivm officials were aware of the practice.A copy of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower indicates that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol\u2019s design incorporated his initials.\u201cNot initially intended as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute,\u201d Mr. Raniere wrote, (\u201cif it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care.)\u201dMs. Edmondson, who lives in Vancouver and helped start Nxivm\u2019s chapter there, was thrilled when Lauren Salzman arrived in January to teach workshops.The women, both in their early 40s, were close and Ms. Edmondson regarded Ms. Salzman as a confidante and mentor.\u201cLauren was someone I really looked up to as a rock star within the company,\u201d said Ms. Edmondson, an actress who joined Nxivm about a decade ago.During her visit, Ms. Salzman said she had something \u201creally amazing\u201d she wanted to share. \u201cIt is kind of strange and top secret and in order for me to tell you about it you need to give me something as collateral to make sure you don\u2019t speak about it,\u201d Ms. Edmondson recalled her saying.The proposition seemed like a test of trust. After Ms. Edmondson wrote a letter detailing past indiscretions, Ms. Salzman told her about the secret sorority.She said it had been formed as a force for good, one that could grow into a network that could influence events like elections. To become effective, members had to overcome weaknesses that Mr. Raniere taught were common to women \u2014 an overemotional nature, a failure to keep promises and an embrace of the role of victim, according to Ms. Edmondson and other members.Submission and obedience would be used as tools to achieve those goals, several women said. The sisterhood would comprise circles, each led by a \u201cmaster\u201d who would recruit six \u201cslaves,\u201d according to two women. In time, they would recruit slaves of their own.\u201cShe made it sound like a bad-ass bitch boot camp,\u201d Ms. Edmondson said.Ms. Edmondson and others said that during training, the women were required to send their master texts that read \u201cMorning M\u201d and \u201cNight M.\u201d During drills, a master texted her slaves \u201c?\u201d and they had 60 seconds to reply \u201cReady M.\u201dTrainees who failed had to pay penalties, including fasting, or could face physical punishments, two women said.In March, Ms. Edmondson arrived for an initiation ceremony at Ms. Salzman\u2019s home in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town about 20 miles north of Albany where Mr. Raniere and some followers live. After undressing, she was led to a candlelit ceremony, where she removed a blindfold and saw Ms. Salzman\u2019s other slaves for the first time. The women were then driven to a nearby house, where the branding took place.In the spring, the sorority grew as women joined different circles. Slaves added compromising collateral every month to Dropbox accounts, and a Google Document was used to list a timetable for recruiting new slaves, several women said.Around the same time, an actress, Catherine Oxenberg, said she learned her daughter had been initiated into the sorority.\u201cI felt sick to my stomach,\u201d said Ms. Oxenberg, who starred in the 1980s television series \u201cDynasty.\u201dMs. Oxenberg had become increasingly concerned about her 26-year-old daughter, India, who looked emaciated from dieting. She told her mother that she had not had a menstrual period for a year and that her hair was falling out.Ms. Oxenberg said she invited her daughter home in late May to try to get her away from the group.When Ms. Oxenberg confronted her about the sorority, her daughter defended its practices.\u201cShe said it was a character-building experience,\u201d Ms. Oxenberg said.By the time the secret group was taking shape, Mark Vicente, the filmmaker, had been a faithful follower of Mr. Raniere for more than a decade.Mr. Vicente said he had been contacted by Ms. Salzman\u2019s mother, Nancy, a co-founder of Nxivm who is known as \u201cPrefect,\u201d after the 2004 release of a documentary he co-directed that explored spirituality and physics.Soon, Mr. Vicente was taking courses that he said helped him expose his fears and learn strategies that made him feel more resolute.\u201cKeith Raniere is an activist, scientist, philosopher and, above all, humanitarian,\u201d Mr. Vicente says in the film.Before Nxivm, he helped run a company called Consumers\u2019 Buyline Inc., which offered discounts to members on groceries and other products.In the mid-1990s, several state attorneys general investigated it as a suspected pyramid scheme; Mr. Raniere and his associates agreed to shut it down.Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.\u201cHumans can be noble,\u201d he says on his website. \u201cThe question is: will we put forth what is necessary?\u201dBy many accounts, Mr. Raniere sleeps during the day and goes out at night to play volleyball or take female followers for long walks. Several women described him as warm, funny and eager to talk about subjects that interested them.Others saw a different side. Nxivm sued several former members, accusing them of stealing its trade secrets, among other things.Mr. Vicente\u2019s views began to change this year after his wife was ostracized when she left Nxivm and he heard rumors about the secret sorority.Mr. Vicente said he got evasive answers when he asked Mr. Raniere about the group. Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving \u201cfive women permission to do something,\u201d but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before. Suddenly, self-awareness techniques he had learned felt like tools that had been used to control him.\u201cNo one goes in looking to have their personality stripped away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t realize what is happening.\u201dIn May, Sarah Edmondson began to recoil from her embrace of the secret society.Her husband, Anthony Ames, who was also a Nxivm member, learned about her branding and the couple both wanted out.Before quitting, Mr. Ames went to Nxivm\u2019s offices in Albany to collect money he said the group owed him.He had his cellphone in his pocket and turned on its recorder.On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral. \u201cThis is criminal,\u201d Mr. Ames says.The voice of a woman \u2014 who Mr. Ames said is Lauren Salzman \u2014 is heard trying to calm him. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are open to having a conversation,\u201d she said.\u201cYou are absolutely right, I\u2019m not open to having a conversation,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy wife got branded.\u201dA few days later, many of Mr. Raniere\u2019s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr. Mr. Parlato had been locked in a long legal battle with two sisters, Sara and Clare Bronfman, who are members of Nxivm and the daughters of Edgar Bronfman, the deceased chairman of Seagram Company.In 2011, the Bronfman sisters sued Mr. Parlato, whom they had hired as a consultant, alleging he had defrauded them of $1 million.Four years later, in 2015, the Justice Department indicted him on charges of fraud and other crimes arising from alleged activities, including defrauding the Bronfmans. Mr. Parlato has denied the claims and the case is pending.Mr. Parlato started a website, The Frank Report, which he uses to lambaste prosecutors, Mr. Raniere and the Bronfmans. In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, \u201cBranded Slaves and Master Raniere.\u201dA Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.\u201cThere are things I didn\u2019t know that I didn\u2019t sign up for, and I\u2019m not even hearing about it from you,\u201d she texted Mr. Raniere.Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their \u201ccollateral\u201d or suing them.Ms. Mehdaoui said that when she went to say goodbye to Mr. Raniere, he urged her to stay.\u201cDo you think, I\u2019m bad, I don\u2019t agree with abuses,\u201d she recalled him saying. He said the group \u201cgives women tools to be powerful, to regain their power for the sake of building love.\u201dNxivm recently filed criminal complaints with the Vancouver police against Ms. Edmondson and two other women accusing them of mischief and other crimes in connection with the firm\u2019s now-closed center there, according to Ms. Edmondson. The women have denied the allegations. A spokesman for the Vancouver police declined to comment.Ms. Edmondson and other former followers of Mr. Raniere said they were focusing on recovering.\u201cThere is no playbook for leaving a cult,\u201d she said.Susan C.

More than 1,500 buildings were destroyed and roughly 150 square miles scorched, fire officials said.More than a dozen fires in Northern California across eight counties \u2014 including Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino and Yuba \u2014 were fanned by dry winds that gusted across a parched landscape faster than 50 miles an hour.Gov. Jerry Brown issued emergency proclamations for several counties and asked President Trump to declare a major disaster.Here\u2019s what else we know:\u2022 Officials said seven people died in Sonoma County, two in Napa County and one in Mendocino County.\u2022 Santa Rosa, the largest city in Sonoma County, was devastated. Hundreds of homes and businesses were leveled after a fire ignited at the north end of town.\u2022 As many as 20,000 people were forced to evacuate in Northern California, officials said. Reporters described Santa Rosa, with a population of about 175,000, as a virtual ghost town on Monday.\u2022 Two Santa Rosa hospitals evacuated scores of patients, wheeling them out on gurneys and wheelchairs as smoke swept over the city.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)California\u2019s Cook pines have a weird characteristic.The towering trees lean conspicuously to one side, always toward the south, as though buffeted by years of strong winds.But no one really understands why.So a few years ago, botanists from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo took up the mystery.They collected data from 100 or so trees in California. Every one leaned south.Then came an \u201caha\u201d moment.The scientists reached out to a colleague in Australia and asked him to check the Cook pines there.\u201cThe pattern was there,\u201d he said, \u201cjust in the opposite direction.\u201dThe trees appeared to be leaning toward the Equator, a trait never before documented in the plant kingdom.Cook pines are native to New Caledonia, an archipelago in the South Pacific, but they\u2019ve spread the globe, including thousands in California.The Cal Poly researchers found that the leaning pattern held with measurements from Cook pines taken on five Continents.According to their calculations, the odds that it resulted from chance, said Mr. Johns, \u201cwere point zero, zero, with like 14 zeros in front of it. It was pretty clear.\u201dThe why, however, remains an open question.The Cook pine discovery, he offered, was an example of how far science has to go in understanding the way the world works.\u201cAs you know with anything,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more you uncover, the more you realize how little you know.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "A Mapathon to Pinpoint Areas Hardest Hit in Puerto Rico", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaps can show a hidden weakness during natural disasters. In remote areas, where forces often wreak the greatest devastation, entire villages may have never made it onto a map. That could be because private companies, which hold the rights to their maps, have less incentive to include those areas, or because the government does not have the resources for frequent updates to existing maps. Even when a region is mapped, changes in neighborhoods could alter the landscape drastically in less than a year.Juan Francisco Saldarriaga, an adjunct professor at Columbia who was one of the organizers of the mapathon, was shocked by the extent that Puerto Rico, despite being a U.S. territory, still lacked accurate data by the time Hurricane Maria struck.\u201cA lot of buildings in the Caribbean islands haven\u2019t been mapped,\u201d said Mr. Saldarriaga, who specializes in architecture and urban planning. \u201cIn New York, I tell my students that we\u2019re spoiled by the amount of data we have for our city.\u201dThe likelihood of being \u201con the map\u201d can be crudely gauged by something that Dale Kunce, senior geospatial engineer at the American Red Cross, calls \u201cthe Starbucks test.\u201d He said as long as someone can navigate to the nearest Starbucks on their smartphone, their location is likely accounted for in databases such as Google Maps.\u201cA map is foundational to a person\u2019s being, almost,\u201d Mr. Kunce said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the map, if your building, street, neighborhood exists, you exist. And you have a voice.\u201dAlex Gil, Columbia\u2019s digital scholarship coordinator, was another one of the organizers. Most of the volunteers at the mapathon \u2014 hosted by Columbia\u2019s Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities and Columbia University Libraries \u2014 were greenhorns in cartography, working in conjunction with similar sessions at five other universities across the nation.\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d Mr. Gil said, of the destruction in Puerto Rico and of watching the lag in getting aid to the island. \u201cThat\u2019s when I hoped the global community can help out.\u201dMr. Kunce, who also leads the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, is currently stationed in Puerto Rico. Every night, before leaving his office, he downloads and prints out copies of crowdsourced maps for emergency medical workers.To create them, volunteers follow a simple process: Each mapmaker is allotted a different square of territory. Mappers then look at satellite imagery and outline key geographic landmarks. For Columbia\u2019s project, the focus was buildings, but other mapathons have scribbled in roads, coastlines, bridges and more. Once another user verifies the work, the completed map layer goes live, available to anyone with internet access.Adeola Awe, a Bronx resident and a master\u2019s student in geographic information science at Lehman College of The City University of New York, arrived at the mapathon in Manhattan hoping to use his skills in urban planning to help with relief efforts. After being disappointed by the scale of federal assistance, especially compared to Houston and Miami\u2019s post-hurricane responses, Mr. Awe decided to take a break from the sophisticated mapping software that he has used to try a simpler, open-sourced model of OpenStreetMap.Mr. Awe, an immigrant from Nigeria, knows firsthand how insufficient maps can slow down response efforts after heavy flooding.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have these kinds of mapping efforts in my country, so investing my efforts in Puerto Rico today is kind of like helping them, too,\u201d Mr. Awe said.Since the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team was founded in 2010, its volunteers have charted previously unmapped villages in countries from Malawi to North Korea, placing an uncounted 45 million people on a map, said Rebecca Firth, the community partnerships manager. As of Friday, 1,200 OpenStreetMap users have contributed to mapping Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria, outlining 205,000 buildings and 7,200 kilometers of road.\u201cTraditionally people viewed mapping as very expensive and professional,\u201d Ms. Firth said. \u201cWe\u2019ve proven a bunch of volunteers with a small amount of training can create something that is nearly as good as something you pay millions for.\u201dAt the Columbia event, Latin music thrummed in the background, as friends conversed with each other in Spanish, and a group of volunteers held a prolonged discussion with one of the facilitators about the deeper intricacies of mapmaking.Mr. Saldarriaga, a native of Colombia, credits part of the rising popularity of open-sourced mapping to the intrinsic joy of building something. Mapping Puerto Rico was special to him, he said.\u201cWe speak the same language, and so it\u2019s sad to hear that people close to you are suffering that much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re just tracing buildings and mapping roads, achieving a great amount in a couple of hours, it\u2019s a little bit like therapy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

My preschooler who can\u2019t yet ride a bike or read a book had also quickly mastered that she could buy things with the bot\u2019s help, or at least try to.\u201cAlexa, buy me blueberries,\u201d she commanded. Grace, of course, had no idea that Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, was the corporate behemoth behind the helpful female assistant, and that smoothing the way when it came to impulse buys was right up Alexa\u2019s algorithmic alley.Grace\u2019s easy embrace of Alexa was slightly amusing but also alarming. My small experiment, with my daughter as the guinea pig, drove home to me the profound shift in our relationship with technology. For generations, our trust in it has gone no further than feeling confident the machine or mechanism will do what it\u2019s supposed or expected to do, nothing more, nothing less. We trust a washing machine to clean our clothes or an A.T.M. to dispense money, but we don\u2019t expect to form a relationship with them or call them by name.With some trepidation, I watched my daughter gaily hand her decisions over. \u201cAlexa, what should I do today?\u201d Grace asked in her singsong voice on Day 3. It wasn\u2019t long before she was trusting her with the big choices. \u201cAlexa, what should I wear today? My pink or my sparkly dress?\u201dIn April, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a $199 Alexa add-on that features a hands-free selfie camera controlled by your voice. The device doesn\u2019t just hear you, it sees you. According to Amazon, the Style Check feature uses \u201cmachine-learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists\u201d to judge different outfits, awarding them an overall rating to decide which is \u201cbetter\u201d based on \u201ccurrent trends and what flatters you.\u201dThe images it takes of you happen to be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud until you delete them. And while the fashion-savvy assistant helps you decide what to wear, it has an ulterior motive: to sell you clothing, including choices from one of Amazon\u2019s own apparel lines, such as Lark & Ro and North Eleven, started in 2016.It\u2019s these kinds of intersections \u2013 like this small collision between robot \u201chelpfulness\u201d and a latent commercial agenda \u2014 that can make parents like me start to wonder about the ethical niceties of this brave new bot world. Alexa, after all, is not \u201cAlexa.\u201d She\u2019s a corporate algorithm in a black box.Grace doesn\u2019t like it when I tell her what to wear. How would she feel about Alexa judging her? Would she see it as helpful or crushing? This could well be one of our parenting tasks in the near future \u2014 preparing our children for the psychological repercussions of such personal interactions with computer \u201cpeople.\u201dAlmost 80 percent of the children thought Alexa would always tell the truth. Some of the children believed they could teach the devices something useful, like how to make a paper plane, suggesting they felt a genuine, give-and-take relationship with the machines.How do we teach our children to question not only the security and privacy implications but also the ethical and commercial intentions of a device designed by marketers?Our kids are going to need to know where and when it is appropriate to put their trust in computer code alone. I watched Grace hand over her trust to Alexa quickly. There are few checks and balances to deter children from doing just that, not to mention very few tools to help them make informed decisions about A.I. advice. And isn\u2019t helping Gracie learn how to make decisions about what to wear \u2014 and many more even important things in life \u2014 my job? I decided to retire Alexa to the closet.Rachel Botsman is the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cWho Can You Trust?

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Continuing our series on IT Transformation, author David Rogers (pictured) offers his insights on the impact of the digital revolution on business and how IT departments must transform to keep up. He is on the faculty of the Columbia University Business School and the author of four books, including \"The Digital Transformation Playbook: Rethink Your Business for the Digital Age\" (Columbia Business School Publishing, 2016).We are clearly in the middle of a long-term technology revolution impacting business, from the birth of the Web and social media, to the mobile computing revolution, A.I. and beyond. Why this is disruptive is each technology is catalyzing the others. The smartphone catalyzed the app revolution, which transformed consumer behaviors and, therefore, business. Each of these digital technologies is enabling new business models and driving what I call \"asymmetric competition.\"Asymmetric competition is much less about market share, and much more about leverage between firms, and how they interact and work together. So Toyota is not just thinking about how it sells versus other car manufacturers, like Honda, but how it competes for influence and profitability in an ecosystem of ride-sharing services like Uber, data owners like HERE and autonomous software companies like Google.Exactly. And we see that shift in a lot of new business models that are being enabled by technology. They are shifting away from selling a product, to selling a service \u2014 to selling an outcome. And if you already grew your business and built it under a completely different pre-digital environment, it's actually hard to step back and recognize everything that has changed for your industry.To me, digital transformation is not about a new start-up; it\u2019s about how do you change a legacy organization. They have the financial resources. They have talented employees. They have customers, or they wouldn\u2019t have gotten where they are today. The hard part for a legacy business is changing course, to find a new path to growth in the digital economy.That really calls for a different role for IT. IT needs to expand from simply being able to support the current core business model, to enabling a different managerial process that has to run in parallel \u2014 a process that\u2019s based on experimentation, discovery of new products, services, market needs and new business models. And then, as they are discovered, being able to rapidly scale them up.\nIT has to master methods for agile development. It can\u2019t be the old model of an interview process and you get the specs from business, and maybe someone\u2019s talked to a customer at that point, and then it\u2019s handed off to the IT team and they run with it. Teams have to be designed differently, cross-functionally.You need to figure out what\u2019s the right combination for your own business. For example, when and where and how do you use cloud computing \u2014 public or private? Hybrid mixes? Certainly things like flash arrays or in-memory computing are critical to improving the speed of processing. Software-defined architecture is another piece that allows flexible scaling of new applications. This is going to be critical to the speed at which companies can not only experiment and discover business opportunities, but also very rapidly deploy them at scale.I think technology partners can play a critical role for any legacy business as it reinvents its IT function to support digital transformation. Part of that involves actually choosing and deploying the right technologies. But it\u2019s also important to be able to help companies think differently about the role of IT. What does it mean for IT to not simply be an enabler of your traditional business, but to be a partner in driving new value creation?Illustrations by Israel VargasThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Politicians Are Bad at Podcasting", "Date": "2017-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThese days, it seems that everybody\u2019s got a podcast, even members of Congress.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Sean Duffy of Wisconsin debuted their own podcasts this month, joining audio series begun earlier this year from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago.The concept is a no-brainer: satisfy Americans\u2019 seemingly insatiable thirst for political analysis from ready-made political stars with inside perspectives. And from the elected officials\u2019 perspective, the appeal is obvious. They can sidestep media gatekeepers and beam their personalities and priorities straight to their constituents\u2019 ears, all while heightening their national brands, perhaps in anticipation of seeking higher office. It\u2019s less clear what the constituents get out of the deal.On their podcasts, our representatives are doing something almost journalistic: They\u2019re moderating discussions with other political figures, interviewing experts on North Korea or monopoly power and staging interactions with the public. Except there are no actual journalists around to ask any pesky questions. At least on TV interview shows or at news conferences, reporters challenge the politician\u2019s narrative. Even on Twitter, we can tweet back.Excepting Mr. Duffy, this is largely a Democratic phenomenon, and not because people who listen to podcasts are more liberal. Podcast listeners are only a little more left-leaning than America at large: According to Edison Research, 27 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, compared with 24 percent of adult podcast listeners. And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven. But that\u2019s not the only thing wrong with it. The podcasts are also boring.Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them. Mr. Emanuel\u2019s podcast would probably be more captivating if he weren\u2019t so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill. And I\u2019m sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what it\u2019s like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but he\u2019s instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.Part of the problem is that for lawmakers, podcasting is obviously a side gig. In the first episode of \u201cCanarycast,\u201d Mr. Brown tells his guests \u2014 a trio of Whirlpool workers \u2014 that he has to end the interview to cast a vote. Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes. I guess she\u2019s been busy.The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office. These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain. They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs. For lawmakers, the podcast is rarely undertaken in the legitimate pursuit of good content but is instead a dull, modern version of constituent outreach. These shows are an attempt to signal that they are listening to us. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we should listen to them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Founders Wanted to Shape a City. Toronto Is Their Chance.", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDream City?Google\u2019s founders have long fantasized about what would happen if the company could shape the real world as much as it has life on the internet.\u201cYears ago, we were sitting there thinking, Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you could take technical things that we know and apply them to cities?\u201d Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet (now Google\u2019s parent company), said Tuesday. \u201cAnd our founders got really excited about this. We started talking about all of these things that we could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge.\u201dThat is, of course, an outlandish idea. \u201cFor all sorts of good reasons, by the way, it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Mr. Schmidt acknowledged. But there he was standing Tuesday before an array of Canadian flags, in front of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario officials, to announce the closest thing anyone has seen to a tech company that takes the reins in a major city.They want it to embody the city of the future, a technological test bed for other communities around the world, \u201cthe world\u2019s first neighborhood built from the internet up.\u201dIn theory, each of these ideas would be best tested across more than just one building or street, and all of them would be more easily implemented together. Once you cover your traffic lights in sensors, it\u2019s easier to turn them into air-quality monitors, too; as long as you\u2019re redesigning streets around driverless cars, you can also think about what the delivery robots need.There\u2019s no small contradiction in having tech founders muse about how to build better cities from places that bear little resemblance to lively cities at all.Many intractable urban problems are in fact not engineering problems at all, including the ones that most look like it. Housing is very expensive in a place like San Francisco not because we haven\u2019t developed the right engineering methods to build it more cheaply. Unaffordable housing is largely a political problem \u2014 we haven\u2019t developed the societal consensus to build enough of it.Sidewalk Labs, to its credit, has internalized many of these criticisms. The company, formed by Google two years ago, has pointedly been based in New York City and not Silicon Valley. It\u2019s staffed by both technologists and government alums. Its leader, the former New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff, openly acknowledges the gulf between technologists and city government types. And Sidewalk Labs says it wants to bridge the two.\u201cWe all collectively see cities as about friction: good friction and bad friction,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff told me not long after Sidewalk Labs started. \u201cGood friction is serendipity, it\u2019s opportunity, it\u2019s diversity, it\u2019s seeing 40 different nationalities on the subway as you commute in the morning. Bad friction is congestion, it\u2019s pollution.\u201dThe technologist\u2019s temptation may be to try to build a city from scratch, with none of that friction. And especially without the greatest friction of all, politics. In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is looking at something between a blank slate and New York City: a sizable plot of land to develop that\u2019s still part of a city large enough that any successful ideas could ultimately spread.Because it\u2019s looking at a neighborhood and not just a typical developer\u2019s parcel, Sidewalk Labs can play with all the infrastructure that connects those parcels \u2014 the utility grid, the street network, the sidewalks. But there would be no point in doing all that if there weren\u2019t thousands of people nearby ready to move in, as is the case in rapidly growing Toronto. (Google also announced Tuesday that it would move its Canadian headquarters, which are in Toronto, into the first pilot phase of the development.)The challenge now amid all the carbon-neutral, internet-enabled robot-monitor sensors will be to keep those humans in mind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Turns on the Charm Amid Criticism From Right and Left", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On a sunny day in July, commuters arriving at Union Station, in the shadow of Capitol Hill, were greeted with free bananas passed out by Amazon employees. In a Senate building, lawmakers and their aides attended policy panels on how Amazon manages privacy on its Echo devices and how sales for small businesses are booming on its online store.The day was capped off with a cocktail reception hosted by Amazon\u2019s chief spokesman, Jay Carney \u2014 the former press secretary to President Obama.Amazon is sweeping the nation\u2019s capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period.The company\u2019s more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company\u2019s overall reputation, is a break from its past. Before last year, the company relied on a no-frills operation for more than a decade, prodding officials in Washington on narrow laws and regulations and arguing about the nuances of issues like sales taxes and copyright.The efforts may not directly apply to an imminent bill or regulation, but they allow the company to steer policy conversations that may be important to Amazon in the future. Amazon is hosting events for lawmakers, like the day of events in July, and holding discussions on transportation and labor policies for congressional staff and policy makers at its sleek offices near Capitol Hill. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other political leaders have visited Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers in their home districts, where Amazon talks up the thousands of jobs those warehouses support.Amazon\u2019s strategic shift has happened as politicians are getting bolder in their criticism about the size and influence of big tech companies. Republicans and Democrats alike have focused on issues including antitrust, privacy and public disclosure.Many of the harshest attacks have been directed at Facebook and Google, which also have robust lobbying arms in Washington. But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company\u2019s push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition. President Trump has lashed out at the company and Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive, multiple times, accusing the company of avoiding taxes among other things. The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes.\u201cThe concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon\u2019s $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy.Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201cThey are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that\u2019s helped it generate a lot of media attention,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon.Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations. More than a dozen organizations were new to its sponsorship roster, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Foundation and the conservative Law & Economic Center at George Mason University.Amazon is racing to catch up. Yet even with similar lobbying armies, Google and Facebook have not escaped criticism \u2014 in their cases over their platforms\u2019 potential to shape public opinion.\u201cWith Amazon, we need more transparency and need to look at longer term factors when it comes to competition,\u201d Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Senator from Minnesota said in a recent interview. \u201cThe people at the Justice Department in antitrust need to look at deals in other ways.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were also entirely false \u2014 and widely spread by Google and Facebook.Google and Facebook blamed algorithm errors for these.A Google spokesman said, \u201cThis should not have appeared for any queries, and we\u2019ll continue to make algorithmic improvements to prevent this from happening in the future.\u201dA Facebook spokesman said, \u201cWe are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused.\u201dBut this was no one-off incident. Over the past few years, extremists, conspiracy theorists and government-backed propagandists have made a habit of swarming major news events, using search-optimized \u201ckeyword bombs\u201d and algorithm-friendly headlines. These organizations are skilled at reverse-engineering the ways that tech platforms parse information, and they benefit from a vast real-time amplification network that includes 4Chan and Reddit as well as Facebook, Twitter and Google. Even when these campaigns are thwarted, they often last hours or days \u2014 long enough to spread misleading information to millions of people.The latest fake news flare-up came at an inconvenient time for companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are already defending themselves from accusations that they have let malicious actors run rampant on their platforms.There is also a labeling issue. A Facebook user looking for news about the Las Vegas shooting on Monday morning, or a Google user searching for information about the wrongfully accused shooter, would have found posts from 4Chan and Sputnik alongside articles by established news organizations like CNN and NBC News, with no obvious cues to indicate which ones came from reliable sources.The automation of editorial judgment, combined with tech companies\u2019 reluctance to appear partisan, has created a lopsided battle between those who want to spread misinformation and those tasked with policing it. Posting a malicious rumor on Facebook, or writing a false news story that is indexed by Google, is a nearly instantaneous process; removing such posts often requires human intervention. This imbalance gives an advantage to rule-breakers, and makes it impossible for even an army of well-trained referees to keep up.The investigations into Russia\u2019s exploitation of social media during the 2016 presidential election will almost certainly continue for months. But dozens of less splashy online misinformation campaigns are happening every day, and they deserve attention, too. Tech companies should act decisively to prevent hoaxes and misinformation from spreading on their platforms, even if it means hiring thousands more moderators or angering some partisan organizations.Facebook and Google have spent billions of dollars developing virtual reality systems. They can spare a billion or two to protect actual reality.Advertisement"}

That is 3,000 percent more than the amount raised using coin offerings in 2016.Coin offerings are a way for start-ups or online projects to raise money without selling stock or going to venture capitalists \u2014 essentially a new form of crowdfunding.The programmers raise money by creating and selling their own virtual currency, generally with rules similar to well-known virtual currencies like Bitcoin. The new tokens are usually designed so that they can be used only on a computing service the programmers are building.Filecoin, which raised $257 million in the largest coin offering to date, is being designed to pay for storage on a global cloud storage network that the creators of Filecoin are promising to build. BET, another coin, is being designed to serve as the chips in an online casino its programmers are promising to build.\u201cPromising to build\u201d is the operative phrase here, because in almost every case the services that will supposedly make these coins valuable have not yet been finished.These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist \u2014 to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity \u2014 and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem.Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network). What\u2019s more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology.But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value.The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors. But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors don\u2019t get an ownership stake in the start-ups. If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law. A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it.Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used. So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed.In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up. When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny. In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase.After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding \u2014 similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O. The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up.The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future.The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists. The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded. The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesn\u2019t even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million.Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings don\u2019t have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors.Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital won\u2019t fund. Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum. Filecoin\u2019s cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company.It is easier than it seems. The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics. There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept. Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything.Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.China and South Korea have said it is illegal.In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds. If a coin is categorized as a security, it has to follow all relevant securities law, such as registering with the authorities and ensuring that people buying the coins are properly accredited and vetted. Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules.Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down. Some are expecting that the first targets will be the exchanges where the coins are traded.Investors don\u2019t have much recourse. The most likely outcome will be that the investors will lose the money they put into the project, though people may try to sue.A number of prominent Silicon Valley investors have argued that coin offerings could provide a way to build open-source projects that would not have otherwise received support.Some big names think this will lead to a new generation of open-source internet protocols and loosen the control of big companies like Google and Facebook.But even sophisticated enthusiasts believe that almost all of the companies currently raising money through coin offerings will fail and lose money for their investors \u2014 and probably should not happen in the first place.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Replacement Home Arrives, Little Assembly Required", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNancy Fisher\u2019s replacement home arrived on a truck. In four big pieces.Each one was lifted by crane and set atop concrete pillars in Midland Beach, a neighborhood on Staten Island that was swamped by Hurricane Sandy. Then the pieces were strapped and bolted together like giant Lego blocks to make a Cape Cod-style house.Inside, the rooms were larger than expected with gleaming hardwood floors, freshly painted walls and wide open views beyond the neighborhood to the One World Trade Center skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m on HGTV \u2014 one of those shows where they do new homes for people,\u201d said Ms. Fisher, 48, a hospital clerical worker who lost her home to Hurricane Sandy\u2019s devastating flooding.Five years after the storm ravaged the region, New York City is resorting to modular houses as a faster and cheaper alternative to rebuilding on site from scratch. The replacement houses are part of the city\u2019s controversial $2.2 billion Hurricane Sandy rebuilding program for homeowners, which is funded through federal aid.It is the largest such effort in the nation and expands the use of modular homes in disaster recovery programs from a stopgap measure to a permanent rebuilding solution, according to city officials and industry experts. Modular homes \u2014 not to be confused with trailer homes \u2014 are built to the same standards as traditional houses and look no different when fully assembled and connected to water and utility lines.The program has significantly picked up the pace in the past year after taking steps to streamline building and zoning requirements, broaden the pool of contractors and introduce modular homes to simplify and speed up the design and construction process.City officials said that 87 percent of the 8,300 homeowners who enrolled in Build It Back have received benefits ranging from a reimbursement check for minor repairs to an entirely rebuilt house. Nearly everyone else is expected to receive their assistance by March. \u201cIt\u2019s really turned around in the last year and you can see that walking through these communities,\u201d said Amy Peterson, the director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing Recovery Operations, who oversees the program.Most of the remaining homeowners in the program require extensive work. As of this month, the city has finished 189 out of a total of 500 houses that will be rebuilt through the program, or three times more than the 53 houses that were finished a year ago. It has also finished 370 out of a total of 850 homes that will be elevated, or six times more than the 58 elevations a year ago.Steven Zboinski, 57, whose house on Staten Island is being rebuilt, said the program was finally working. He still remembers submitting required documents in the beginning, only to be told that they had been lost. Soon he was making 10 copies of everything. \u201cIt took off to a very bad start and now it\u2019s come back to something that\u2019s actually getting things done,\u201d he said.But City Councilman Mark Treyger, the chairman of the council\u2019s recovery and resiliency committee, said that despite recent improvements, the Build It Back program overall has been plodding and limited. He said that too many homeowners never enrolled because they did not know about it or had language barriers, while others dropped out after becoming stymied by conflicting and confusing information. As a result, he said, many have depleted their savings, remain stuck in temporary housing and face a desperate future.\u201cYes, progress has been made but it should not be celebrated because we have a long way to go,\u201d said Mr. Treyger, a Democrat who represents storm-battered Coney Island, Sea Gate, and Gravesend in Brooklyn. He has called for the city to reopen the program to more applicants.City officials said that more than 20,000 people initially registered for Build It Back, most of whom lived in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. Of those, about half never finished the application process and program workers were later dispatched to reach out to them. In 2015, they contacted 4,000 homeowners, 599 of whom returned to the program.The long process to rebuild has aggravated many families. Marcos Baez, 40, said he stayed in a shelter for months after Hurricane Sandy while his family\u2019s house on Staten Island was made temporarily habitable. Now he has moved out again while waiting for a new modular home. \u201cIt\u2019s just stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m displaced again by Sandy for the second time.\u201dOutside the city, New York State\u2019s disaster recovery program has awarded more than $1.1 billion in grants to 11,900 homeowners to rebuild, repair and make homes more storm-resilient. Of those homeowners, 66 percent have completed construction, including elevating 1,300 of what will eventually be 3,500 homes.In New York City, modular homes are expected to improve the rebuilding process, said Lou Mendes, chief operating officer of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing Recovery Operations. In the past, there have been delays because the extent of damage to an existing house was not known until it was already elevated, requiring major structural repairs to be made in the air.Modular homes not only eliminate such surprises, but they also save time because they are based on prototype designs and allow for the foundation and the house to be built at the same time, rather than one after the other. Mr. Mendes said that he aims to have a homeowner in a modular home in four to six months.The benefits extend to the entire rebuilding program, city officials said. Since modular homes require only minimal work \u2014 to add staircases and finishes \u2014 local contractors are available for more projects. Modular homes are also about 25 percent cheaper than site-built homes, saving $175,00 to $200,000 per home, according to city estimates.Still, modular is not the answer in every case. Utility wires or trees can block a site, or the street can be too narrow to accommodate a crane or a truck carrying a house.Some homeowners have also rejected a modular home, despite efforts by Build It Back\u2019s architects and engineers to educate them about what it is, and is not. On visits to modular houses, homeowners have banged on the walls to make sure they are solid.Ms. Fisher said she did not know if she wanted to go modular but decided to take a chance. Working with the city, she picked out the gray-blue color of the 1,652-square-foot house as well as the roof shingles, floors, cabinets and countertops.She has no complaints, she said.\u201cIf we do get hit with a storm, I know I will be safe,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent satisfied with all the work that\u2019s been done so far.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Israel Caught Russian Hackers Scouring the World for U.S. Secrets", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "Supported byIt was a case of spies watching spies watching spies: Israeli intelligence officers looked on in real time as Russian government hackers searched computers around the world for the code names of American intelligence programs.What gave the Russian hacking, detected more than two years ago, such global reach was its improvised search tool \u2014 antivirus software made by a Russian company, Kaspersky Lab, that is used by 400 million people worldwide, including by officials at some two dozen American government agencies.The Russian operation, described by multiple people who have been briefed on the matter, is known to have stolen classified documents from a National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, on which Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software was installed. What additional American secrets the Russian hackers may have gleaned from multiple agencies, by turning the Kaspersky software into a sort of Google search for sensitive information, is not yet publicly known.The current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules.Like most security software, Kaspersky Lab\u2019s products require access to everything stored on a computer in order to scour it for viruses or other dangers. Its popular antivirus software scans for signatures of malicious software, or malware, then removes or neuters it before sending a report back to Kaspersky. That procedure, routine for such software, provided a perfect tool for Russian intelligence to exploit to survey the contents of computers and retrieve whatever they found of interest.The National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment for this article. The Israeli Embassy declined to comment, and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.Kaspersky Lab denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. \u201cKaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,\u201d the company said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. Kaspersky Lab also said it \u201crespectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would enable the company to begin an investigation at the earliest opportunity.\u201dFor years, there has been speculation that Kaspersky\u2019s popular antivirus software might provide a back door for Russian intelligence. More than 60 percent, or $374 million, of the company\u2019s $633 million in annual sales come from customers in the United States and Western Europe. Among them have been nearly two dozen American government agencies \u2014 including the State Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Justice Department, Treasury Department and the Army, Navy and Air Force.The N.S.A. bans its analysts from using Kaspersky antivirus at the agency, in large part because the agency has exploited antivirus software for its own foreign hacking operations and knows the same technique is used by its adversaries.\u201cAntivirus is the ultimate back door,\u201d Blake Darch\u00e9, a former N.S.A. operator and co-founder of Area 1 Security. \u201cIt provides consistent, reliable and remote access that can be used for any purpose, from launching a destructive attack to conducting espionage on thousands or even millions of users.\u201dOn Sept. 13, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal executive branch agencies to stop using Kaspersky products, giving agencies 90 days to remove the software. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine C. Duke cited the \u201cinformation security risks\u201d presented by Kaspersky and said the company\u2019s antivirus and other software \u201cprovide broad access to files\u201d and \u201ccan be exploited by malicious cyber actors to compromise\u201d federal computer systems.That directive, which some officials thought was long overdue, was based, in large part, on intelligence gleaned from Israel\u2019s 2014 intrusion into Kaspersky\u2019s corporate systems. It followed months of discussions among intelligence officials, which included a study of how Kaspersky\u2019s software works and the company\u2019s suspected ties with the Kremlin.\u201cThe risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky,\u201d D.H.S. said in its statement, \u201ccould capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.\u201dThe report did not name Israel as the intruder but noted that the breach bore striking similarities to a previous attack, known as \u201cDuqu,\u201d which researchers had attributed to the same nation states responsible for the infamous Stuxnet cyberweapon. Stuxnet was a joint American-Israeli operation that successfully infiltrated Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility, and used malicious code to destroy a fifth of Iran\u2019s uranium centrifuges in 2010.Kaspersky reported that its attackers had used the same algorithm and some of the same code as Duqu, but noted that in many ways it was even more sophisticated. So the company researchers named the new attack Duqu 2.0, noting that other victims of the attack were prime Israeli targets.Among the targets Kaspersky uncovered were hotels and conference venues used for closed-door meetings by members of the United Nations Security Council to negotiate the terms of the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 negotiations from which Israel was excluded. Several targets were in the United States, which suggested that the operation was Israel\u2019s alone, not a joint American-Israeli operation like Stuxnet.Kaspersky\u2019s researchers noted that attackers had managed to burrow deep into the company\u2019s computers and evade detection for months. Investigators later discovered that the Israeli hackers had implanted multiple back doors into Kaspersky\u2019s systems, employing sophisticated tools to steal passwords, take screenshots, and vacuum up emails and documents.In its June 2015 report, Kaspersky noted that its attackers seemed primarily interested in the company\u2019s work on nation-state attacks, particularly Kaspersky\u2019s work on the \u201cEquation Group\u201d \u2014 its private industry term for the N.S.A. \u2014 and the \u201cRegin\u201d campaign, another industry term for a hacking unit inside the United Kingdom\u2019s intelligence agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.Israeli intelligence officers informed the N.S.A. that in the course of their Kaspersky hack, they uncovered evidence that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky\u2019s access to aggressively scan for American government classified programs, and pulling any findings back to Russian intelligence systems. They provided their N.S.A. counterparts with solid evidence of the Kremlin campaign in the form of screenshots and other documentation, according to the people briefed on the events.But experts on Russia say that under President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, businesses asked for assistance by Russian spy agencies may feel they have no choice but to give it. To refuse might well invite hostile action from the government against the business or its leaders. Mr. Kaspersky, who attended an intelligence institute and served in Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense, would have few illusions about the cost of refusing a Kremlin request.Steven L. Hall, a former chief of Russian operations at the C.I.A., said his former agency never used Kaspersky software, but other federal agencies did. By 2013, he said, Kaspersky officials were \u201ctrying to do damage control and convince the U.S. government that it was just another security company.\u201dHe didn\u2019t buy it, Mr. Hall said. \u201cI had the gravest concerns about Kaspersky, and anyone who worked on Russia or in counterintelligence shared those concerns,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lyft Is Said to Explore I.P.O. as It Raises $1 Billion Led by Alphabet", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In an escalation of its ride-hailing war against Uber, Lyft has begun to explore going public in 2018 and is trying to strengthen its position by raising more capital, including $1 billion in new financing led by an investment arm of Google\u2019s parent company.Lyft has had talks with investment banks about an initial public offering next year, according to two people briefed on the discussions, who asked to remain anonymous because the conversations are confidential. Lyft has not decided which bank may become its lead underwriter for an I.P.O., the people said.To bolster itself ahead of any public offering, Lyft on Thursday said it had raised $1 billion in financing led by CapitalG, a venture investment arm of Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet. The funding values Lyft at $10 billion before the introduction of new capital \u2014 a significant jump from the company\u2019s last valuation of $6.9 billion.But the financing also gives Lyft a new and formidable partner in Alphabet. As part of the deal, David Lawee, a venture partner at CapitalG, will take a seat on Lyft\u2019s board of directors. The investment round, which includes other undisclosed participants, remains open.Alphabet\u2019s investment ratchets up the high-stakes battle for supremacy in the ride-hailing industry.Lyft has benefited from Uber\u2019s series of high-profile stumbles in recent months to lift its own profile. The two companies are locked in something of a race for which can go public first; whichever company does will most likely set a benchmark for Wall Street for the valuation of a public ride-hailing company.Investors trying to position themselves for the best returns have put money into competing entities, creating murky allegiances.SoftBank, for example, is also a major investor in Didi, a ride-hailing company that was once a major competitor to Uber in China and is itself an investor in Lyft. And CapitalG is a sister company to GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, which is a major investor in Uber.Those relationships are further complicated by how Uber is dealing with a lawsuit filed by Waymo, the self-driving car unit owned by Alphabet. Waymo has accused Uber of stealing trade secrets after it hired a former Google employee.\u201cRide-sharing is still in its early days,\u201d Mr. Lawee, a partner at CapitalG, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to seeing Lyft continue its impressive growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering From Severe Anxiety?", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "FeatureParents, therapists and schools are struggling to figure out whether helping anxious teenagers means protecting them or pushing them to face their fears.Supported byNot coincidentally, failure was one of Jake\u2019s biggest fears. He worried about it privately; maybe he couldn\u2019t keep up with his peers, maybe he wouldn\u2019t succeed in life. The relentless drive to avoid such a fate seemed to come from deep inside him. He considered it a strength.Jake\u2019s parents knew he could be high-strung; in middle school, they sent him to a therapist when he was too scared to sleep in his own room. But nothing prepared them for the day two years ago when Jake, then 17, seemingly \u201cran 150 miles per hour into a brick wall,\u201d his mother said. He refused to go to school and curled up in the fetal position on the floor. \u201cI just can\u2019t take it!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand!\u201dJake was right \u2014 his parents didn\u2019t understand. Jake didn\u2019t really understand, either. But he also wasn\u2019t good at verbalizing what he thought he knew: that going to school suddenly felt impossible, that people were undoubtedly judging him, that nothing he did felt good enough. \u201cAll of a sudden I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so afraid.\u201d His tall, lanky frame succumbed, too. His stomach hurt. He had migraines. \u201cYou know how a normal person might have their stomach lurch if they walk into a classroom and there\u2019s a pop quiz?\u201d he told me. \u201cWell, I basically started having that feeling all the time.\u201dAlarmed, Jake\u2019s parents sent him to his primary-care physician, who prescribed Prozac, an antidepressant often given to anxious teenagers. It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work \u2014 and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake \u201cmuch more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,\u201d his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake\u2019s father wrote: \u201cJake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.\u201d A week later, though, Jake couldn\u2019t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse\u2019s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. \u201cIt was the depth of hell,\u201d his mother told me.Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing \u2014 and learning to talk back to \u2014 their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That\u2019s an easy exercise for anxious young people (\u201cOnly three?\u201d one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a \u201cstrong and powerful response\u201d to each negative thought.She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,\u201d Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, \u201cthen I\u2019ll get a bad grade in the class, I won\u2019t get into the college I want, I won\u2019t get a good job and I\u2019ll be a total failure.\u201dAt Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake\u2019s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn\u2019t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down \u2014 and that his value as a person didn\u2019t depend on where he went to school.Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn\u2019t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn\u2019t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.At the last one, Jillian\u2019s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.\u201cIf it\u2019s too much, you can stop,\u201d the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. \u201cNo, I feel like I need to do this,\u201d she announced. \u201cI have a week and a half left. If I can\u2019t get through something like this here ...\u201dHer voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing \u2014 and much less forgiving.\u201cAnxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,\u201d explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center\u2019s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: \u201cThe overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.\u201d\u201cThe fears can be very real for our kids,\u201d explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic\u2019s medical director. \u201cOftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there\u2019s a history of trauma and abuse.\u201d The contemporary political climate can also feel \u201cincredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,\u201d Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who \u201cact out\u201d are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves \u2014 anxiety specialists call them \u201csilent sufferers\u201d \u2014 are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. \u201cIf you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,\u201d Kendall says. \u201cWhen you start to talk about anxiety, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, those are the kids we like!\u2019\u2009\u201dTeenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. \u201cThese kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,\u201d she says, but there\u2019s \u201ccontempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.\u201dFor many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they \u201cnever get to the point where they can say, \u2018I\u2019ve done enough, and now I can stop,\u2019\u2009\u201d Luthar says. \u201cThere\u2019s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they\u2019re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. \u201cTeenagers used to tell me, \u2018I just need to get my parents off my back,\u2019\u2009\u201d recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. \u201cNow so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.\u201dThough there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there\u2019s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. \u201cThey wonder about whether it\u2019s safe to go to a movie theater,\u201d she said.When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn\u2019t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids\u2019 digital habits \u2014 round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers \u2014 were partly to blame for their children\u2019s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation\u2019s relationship to social media. \u201cI don\u2019t think we realize how much it\u2019s affecting our moods and personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media is a tool, but it\u2019s become this thing that we can\u2019t live without but that\u2019s making us crazy.\u201dWhile smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. \u201cIt was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,\u201d he said. Jake\u2019s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the \u201cillusion of control and certainty\u201d that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. \u201cTeens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who\u2019s checked in online,\u201d Ashworth told the parents. \u201cBut life doesn\u2019t always come with that kind of certainty, and they\u2019re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.\u201dJean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. \u201cIt seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn\u2019t much evidence for it,\u201d she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is \u201call wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy was improving by the time the increase started.\u201dMore than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to convince them anymore,\u201d she told me. \u201cSchools are coming to us, eager for help.\u201dA gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety \u201cthe cult leader\u201d \u2014 for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves \u2014 and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. \u201cAnxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,\u201d Lyons explained. \u201cWhen we play along, we don\u2019t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.\u201dShe pointed to the increasing use of \u201c504 plans,\u201d a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door \u2014 to avoid the chaos of the main entrance \u2014 and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are \u201cavoidance-based and teach zero skills.\u201d She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager \u201ccan go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,\u201d she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student \u201cexternalize his worry,\u201d similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.\u201cIf anxiety could talk, it would say, \u2018You know, let\u2019s just get out of here. We don\u2019t have to do this!\u2019\u2009\u201d Lyons said from the stage. \u201cBut in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I\u2019m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they\u2019re so frail, like they can\u2019t handle things.\u201dLyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces \u2014 and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. \u201cKids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can\u2019t handle being triggered, that they shouldn\u2019t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,\u201d she told me.Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word \u2014 \u201cresiliency\u201d \u2014 kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren\u2019t \u201cequipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,\u201d a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety \u2014 and as more of those \u201cstop coming to school, because they just can\u2019t.\u201dSome schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called \u201cour more fragile students.\u201d At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch\u2019s painting \u201cThe Scream.\u201d These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck \u2014 not that anyone was keeping score.I couldn\u2019t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs\u2019 teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?\u201cSome will say that this feeds the monster,\u201d concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We\u2019ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don\u2019t come to school if they have to spend all day in\u201d general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury\u2019s regular classes \u2014 and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program\u2019s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program\u2019s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to \u201csacrifice the anxious kid\u201d in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. \u201cWhat\u2019s the issue today?\u201d I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a \u201cHail Mary,\u201d as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone \u201cright next to his face,\u201d he rarely responds when he\u2019s feeling anxious. \u201cI appreciate you picking up \u2014 you don\u2019t normally do that,\u201d Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to \u201chide from, control and avoid\u201d their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.Critelli looked at him incredulously. \u201cDude, you\u2019re failing physics,\u201d Critelli said. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have anything to do?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do \u2014 I\u2019m going to fail,\u201d the student mumbled.\u201cSo you\u2019re just accepting that you\u2019re going to fail?\u201d The boy looked at his hands. \u201cHere\u2019s an idea,\u201d Critelli continued. \u201cYou can email your teacher and say, \u2018What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?\u2019\u2009\u201dCritelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you advocate for yourselves!\u201dWhile he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. \u201cThat was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn\u2019t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,\u201d he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had \u201caced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.\u201d But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. \u201cJust being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCollege is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.\u201dThe doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn\u2019t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a \u201cWalking Dead\u201d costume contest at a local car dealership.While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series\u2019s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. \u201cI\u2019d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them were like, \u2018Just kill yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201dNothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn\u2019t want to open up and be known as \u201cthe anxious girl.\u201d There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,\u201d the headmaster told me \u2014 but Jillian didn\u2019t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backward,\u201d she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. \u201cThere\u2019s feeling a weight on your chest, and there\u2019s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as I\u2019d wake up, it was absolute dread.\u201dNeeding to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother \u2014 who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support \u2014 could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn\u2019t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn\u2019t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was \u201cmanipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn\u2019t feel like doing,\u201d she said.\u201cThe million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she\u2019s going to have a panic attack?\u201d Allison told me. \u201cI feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.\u201dHe also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children\u2019s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they\u2019ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they\u2019re afraid to. \u201cSo many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,\u201d Ashworth said.While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a \u201clet\u2019s not take life \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 too seriously\u201d approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, \u201cyou\u2019ve just made his day,\u201d Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn\u2019t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn\u2019t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. \u201cWe basically said, \u2018O.K., anxiety, you win.\u2019\u2009\u201dJillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. \u201cI\u2019m just a lot more relaxed now,\u201d she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with \u201cStar Wars\u201d posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of \u201cChicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.\u201d Near her bed were two prescription bottles \u2014 one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be \u201ca lot worse if I wasn\u2019t taking them.\u201dThough she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule \u2014 including yoga, studying and cleaning her room \u2014 that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at \u201cStar Wars\u201d conventions or on social media.At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.\u201cO.K., I\u2019m going to go mingle,\u201d she announced.But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. \u201cWe\u2019re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,\u201d says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cAnd when we do give them therapy, it\u2019s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we\u2019re not treating people with what actually works best.\u201dPart of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren\u2019t typically eager to feel more anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s also uncomfortable for many therapists,\u201d Whiteside told me. \u201cMost people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you\u2019re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s not much fun for anybody. It\u2019s much easier to sit in a therapist\u2019s office and talk about feelings.\u201dFor two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.\u201cEven better \u2014 let\u2019s make it weird,\u201d Randolph told him.The boy shook his head. \u201cMaybe the guy\u2019s on break and doesn\u2019t want to be bothered.\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cHe might hate you. He might get real mad at you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s terrifying,\u201d the teenager confessed. \u201cAnd what if we\u2019re so close on the bench that we\u2019re touching?\u201d\u201cThat would be awkward,\u201d Randolph said with a half-smile.The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. \u201cIs he sitting in the middle of the bench?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 he might be,\u201d Randolph told him. \u201cBut are you going to \u2018what if\u2019 this to death, or are you going to do it?\u201dHe eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: \u201cI\u2019ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.\u201d The \u201cAsk Me\u201d was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including \u201cB*tch,\u201d \u201cF*ggot,\u201d \u201cUr Fat\u201d and \u201cKill Yourself.\u201d Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas\u2019s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas\u2019s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. \u201cOh, my God, that was the greatest,\u201d Thomas announced upon his return.I asked him what they\u2019d talked about. \u201cThe muscular dude said he\u2019s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,\u201d Thomas told us. \u201cThen the girl said, \u2018You\u2019re really brave. Can I give you a hug?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what you were expecting, huh?\u201d Randolph said. \u201cInstead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.\u201d\u201cYeah, it was awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel so good!\u201d\u201cAnd what if he was?\u201d Randolph asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for what he\u2019s thinking.\u201dThe boy appeared to consider Randolph\u2019s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, \u201cexactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it\u2019s all manageable.\u201dLast month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. \u201cThe health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,\u201d he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home \u2014 and some of his peers from Mountain Valley \u2014 via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. \u201cMy junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn\u2019t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think like that anymore.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that Jake doesn\u2019t study. He does \u2014 usually days before he needs to. \u201cProcrastination isn\u2019t a good idea for me,\u201d he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato\u2019s \u201cRepublic.\u201dJake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn\u2019t gone through. He said he felt \u201ca sudden burst of anxiety\u201d \u2014 his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was \u201cfreaking out.\u201d Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cThat ended that crisis,\u201d Jake told me.For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university\u2019s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. \u201cI just haven\u2019t felt like I need it here,\u201d Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: \u201cI know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.\u201dI was curious how much of Jake\u2019s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn\u2019t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. \u201cI would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot\u2019s changed.\u201dBefore walking back to his dorm, where Jake\u2019s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A\u2019s that semester. The old Jake might have been first in line. But the new Jake? He hadn\u2019t bothered to show up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Google\u2019s Physical Keys Will Protect Your Password", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYet passwords remain the primary way we log in to online accounts containing our personal and financial information. Google has a new pragmatic solution: Embrace the password, but lock it down with extra physical security.This way, even if hackers stole your password in a data breach or successfully phished for it, by tempting you to hand over your credentials on a fake login page, they couldn\u2019t do anything unless they got their hands on the keys as well. And minimizing risk with minimal effort is a boon to anyone who cares about online security.\u201cI am a big fan of this,\u201d said John Sabin, a former hacker for the National Security Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the easiest and most secure multifactor for the masses.\u201dThe physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you. Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.The idea of Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message. Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group? Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.So we tested Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses. The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys. But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you. To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it. (The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.) This process takes a few minutes.On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins. That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.But there are trade-offs. Google\u2019s Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys. For the time being, that means only Google\u2019s Gmail mail app, Google\u2019s Backup and Sync app, and Google\u2019s Chrome browser.On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Google\u2019s Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser. So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, you\u2019re out of luck. Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A. hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons. On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.On the other hand, if you lose the keys or don\u2019t have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account. Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account. In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle. She said Google\u2019s requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account. That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Google\u2019s program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.\u201cIt\u2019s something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys,\u201d Ms. Sandvik said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason you shouldn\u2019t turn this on.\u201dWhile the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Google\u2019s apps from Apple\u2019s and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Google\u2019s mail, messaging and cloud storage services. But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature \u2014 Apple\u2019s V.I.P. alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you. Google\u2019s iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature. For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P. alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which won\u2019t work with the keys.If you decide to wait, don\u2019t procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages. While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well. When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Google\u2019s keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: \u201cNo comment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We Asked 9 Experts", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf course, criticism of Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is easy to come by; solutions aren\u2019t as clear.

The single most important step Facebook \u2014 and its subsidiary Instagram, which I view as equally important in terms of countering misinformation, hate speech and propaganda \u2014 can take is to abandon the focus on emotional signaling-as-engagement.This is a tough proposition, of course, as billions of users have been trained to do exactly this: \u201creact.\u201dWhat if there were a \u201ctrust emoji\u201d? Or respect-based emojis? If a palette of six emoji-faced angry-love-sad-haha emotional buttons continues to be the way we engage with one another \u2014 and how we respond to the news \u2014 then it\u2019s going to be an uphill battle.Negative emotion, click bait and viral outrage are how the platform is \u201cbeing used to divide.\u201d Given this problem, Facebook needs to help us unite by building new sharing tools based on trust and respect.Co-founder of Wired magazine.Facebook should reduce anonymity by requiring real verification of real names for real people, with the aim of having 100 percent of individuals verified.Companies would need additional levels of verification, and should have a label and scrutiny different from those of people. (Whistle-blowers and dissidents might need to use a different platform.)Facebook could also offer an optional filter that would keep any post (or share) of an unverified account from showing up. I\u2019d use that filter.Democrat representing California\u2019s 17th Congressional District, which includes sections of Silicon Valley. Ultimately, whether from tech companies or Congress, what people want is more transparency.The company also should make its executives readily available to the press, and they should spend time on Capitol Hill to explain their decision-making.Everyone understands that new technology platforms are not perfect, and that bad actors find ways to abuse them. The key is for Facebook to be upfront about technical challenges, open about its mistakes and willing to answer the tough questions honestly. If it does that, it will continue to earn the public\u2019s trust.Chief executive of Upworthy and author of \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201dFacebook should open itself up for independent research. Right now, Facebook is a black box: It\u2019s very difficult, and in many cases impossible, for researchers to independently look at behavior on the platform. While opening private data to research creates risks, there\u2019s a ton of explicitly public data on the platform that Facebook makes difficult to query at scale. Facebook could also open up many of the tools advertisers currently use for free use by research scientists. It would be a bold move for transparency, and one that would help us understand much better what\u2019s happening on the world\u2019s most important social platform. And it\u2019d be wise to do this before regulators forced them to.Early Facebook employee who recounted her time at the company in her book, \u201cThe Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network.\u201dIt would be interesting if Facebook offered a \u201cvintage Facebook\u201d setting that users could toggle to, without News Feed ads and \u201clike\u201d buttons. (Before \u201clikes,\u201d users wrote comments, which made interactions more unique and memorable.)A \u201cvintage Facebook\u201d setting not only would be less cluttered, it would refocus the experience of using Facebook on the people using it, and their intentions for communication and interaction.Somehow, no matter how \u201csmart\u201d the Facebook algorithms and behind-the-scenes data processing get, the site felt more engaging as a tool for human communication when interaction was primarily driven by what users wanted to do and say, rather than where the algorithms want people to look.Assistant professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Facebook should allow users to sort their news feed chronologically by default on all platforms, rather than rely on an algorithmically sorted News Feed. This would increase the diversity of items in the News Feed, and would make it more likely that users were exposed to people and information that didn\u2019t support their own confirmation bias.It should also greatly increase the human oversight of ad targeting systems \u2014 specifically, oversee algorithmically generated categories (rather than basing them solely on user-inputted interests). Political and interest-based advertising should be under much stricter scrutiny than, say, the advertising of T-shirts or hair products.Chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact and a former chief executive of Reddit.Adviser and former news executive at NPR, NBC News and Twitter.The single most important thing Facebook must do is come clean. Tell us what you know. Tell us what you know but can\u2019t share. Tell us what you don\u2019t know. And tell us what you don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t know. Stop hiding behind bromides like \u201cwe are not a media company.\u201d That makes us think you don\u2019t understand you have a serious set of problems that need fixing. Coming clean may not be the only thing, and may not be the main thing, but it\u2019s the first thing.Professor at Columbia Law School and author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201dFacebook should become a public benefit corporation. These companies must aim to do something that would aid the public, and board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook\u2019s goals are \u201cbringing us closer together\u201d and \u201cbuilding a global community.\u201d Worthy, beautiful goals, but easier said than done when Facebook is also stuck delivering ever-increasing profits and making its platform serve the needs of advertisers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Is Not Your Friend", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "Such a somber, self-critical statement hasn\u2019t been typical for the usually sunny Mr. Zuckerberg, who once exhorted his employees at Facebook to \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d In the past, why would Mr. Zuckerberg, or any of his peers, have felt the need to atone for what they did at the office? For making incredibly cool sites that seamlessly connect billions of people to their friends as well as to a global storehouse of knowledge?Lately, however, the sins of Silicon Valley-led disruption have become impossible to ignore.Almost from its inception, the World Wide Web produced public anxiety \u2014 your computer was joined to a network that was beyond your ken and could send worms, viruses and trackers your way \u2014 but we nonetheless were inclined to give these earnest innovators the benefit of the doubt. They were on our side in making the web safe and useful, and thus it became easy to interpret each misstep as an unfortunate accident on the path to digital utopia rather than as subterfuge meant to ensure world domination.Now that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the questions of the hour are, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is? And do we still have the regulatory tools and social cohesion to restrain the monopolists before they smash the foundations of our society?To illustrate their point, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page boasted of the purity of their search engine\u2019s results for the query \u201ccellular phone\u201d; near the top was a study explaining the danger of driving while on the phone. The Google prototype was still ad-free, but what about the others, which took ads? Mr. Brin and Mr. Page had their doubts: \u201cWe expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201dThere was a crucial need for \u201ca competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm,\u201d and Google was set to be that ivory tower internet tool. Until, that is, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page were swept up by the entrepreneurism pervasive to Stanford \u2014 a meeting with a professor led to a meeting with an investor, who wrote a $100,000 check before Google was even a company. In 1999, Google announced a $25 million investment of venture capital while insisting nothing had changed. When Mr. Brin was asked by reporters how Google planned to make money, he replied, \u201cOur goal is to maximize the search experience, not maximize the revenues from search.\u201dSeven years later, Mr. Zuckerberg, too, had succumbed to Silicon Valley venture capital, but he seemed to regret it. \u201cIf I were starting now,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2011, \u201cI just would have stayed in Boston, I think,\u201d before adding: \u201cThere are aspects of the culture out here where I think it still is a little bit short-term focused in a way that bothers me. You know, whether it\u2019s like people who want to start companies to start a company, not knowing what they like, I don\u2019t know, to, like, flip it.\u201dUltimately, however, the founders of Google and Facebook faced a day of reckoning. Investors hadn\u2019t signed on for a charity, and they demanded accountability. In the end, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page agreed under pressure to display advertising alongside search results and eventually to allow an outside chief executive, Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to include ads within the news feed and transferred a favorite programmer to the mobile-advertising business, telling him, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fun to build a billion-dollar business in six months?\u201dTurns out that there were billion-dollar fortunes to be made by exploiting the foggy relationship between the public and tech companies. We all knew there was no such thing as a free lunch, an insight memorably encapsulated in 2010 by a commenter to the website MetaFilter, as, \u201cIf you are not paying for it, you\u2019re not the customer; you\u2019re the product being sold.\u201d But, really, how can you tell? So much of what is happening between the public and Silicon Valley is out of view \u2014 algorithms written and controlled by wizards who are able to extract value from your identity in ways you could never do for yourself.Eliza understood nothing, in truth, and could never reach any shared insight with a \u201cpatient.\u201d Eliza mechanically responded to whatever appeared on the screen. A typical therapy session quickly devolved into a Monty Python sketch. (Patient: You are not very aggressive, but I think you don\u2019t want me to notice that. Eliza: What makes you think I am not very aggressive? Patient: You don\u2019t argue with me. Eliza: Why do you think I don\u2019t argue with you? Patient: You are afraid of me. Eliza: Does it please you to believe I am afraid of you?)Imagine Mr. Weizenbaum\u2019s surprise when his secretary looked up from her computer and interrupted her exchanges with Eliza to say to him, \u201cWould you mind leaving the room, please?\u201d She wanted privacy for a conversation with a machine! Mr. Weizenbaum, appalled, suddenly saw the potential for mischief by programmers who could manipulate computers and potentially the rest of us. He soon switched gears and devoted his remaining years to protesting what he considered the amorality of his computer science peers, frequently referring to his experiences as a young refugee from Nazi Germany.In his epic anti-A.I. work from the mid-1970s, \u201cComputer Power and Human Reason,\u201d Mr. Weizenbaum described the scene at computer labs. \u201cBright young men of disheveled appearance, often with sunken glowing eyes, can be seen sitting at computer consoles, their arms tensed and waiting to fire their fingers, already poised to strike, at the buttons and keys on which their attention seems to be as riveted as a gambler\u2019s on the rolling dice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey exist, at least when so engaged, only through and for the computers. These are computer bums, compulsive programmers.\u201dHe was concerned about them as young students lacking perspective about life and was worried that these troubled souls could be our new leaders. Neither Mr. Weizenbaum nor Mr. McCarthy mentioned, though it was hard to miss, that this ascendant generation were nearly all white men with a strong preference for people just like themselves. In a word, they were incorrigible, accustomed to total control of what appeared on their screens. \u201cNo playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful,\u201d Mr. Weizenbaum wrote, \u201chas ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or a field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.\u201dWelcome to Silicon Valley, 2017.As Mr. Weizenbaum feared, the current tech leaders have discovered that people trust computers and have licked their lips at the possibilities. The examples of Silicon Valley manipulation are too legion to list: push notifications, surge pricing, recommended friends, suggested films, people who bought this also bought that. Early on, Facebook realized there was a hurdle to getting people to stay logged on. \u201cWe came upon this magic number that you needed to find 10 friends,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg recalled in 2011. \u201cAnd once you had 10 friends, you had enough content in your newsfeed that there would just be stuff on a good enough interval where it would be worth coming back to the site.\u201d Facebook would design its site for new arrivals so that it was all about finding people to \u201cfriend.\u201dThe 10 friends rule is an example of a favored manipulation of tech companies, the network effect. People will use your service \u2014 as lame as it may be \u2014 if others use your service. This was tautological reasoning that nonetheless proved true: If everyone is on Facebook, then everyone is on Facebook. You need to do whatever it takes to keep people logging in, and if rivals emerge, they must be crushed or, if stubbornly resilient, acquired.Growth becomes the overriding motivation \u2014 something treasured for its own sake, not for anything it brings to the world. Facebook and Google can point to a greater utility that comes from being the central repository of all people, all information, but such market dominance has obvious drawbacks, and not just the lack of competition. As we\u2019ve seen, the extreme concentration of wealth and power is a threat to our democracy by making some people and companies unaccountable.In addition to their power, tech companies have a tool that other powerful industries don\u2019t: the generally benign feelings of the public. To oppose Silicon Valley can appear to be opposing progress, even if progress has been defined as online monopolies; propaganda that distorts elections; driverless cars and trucks that threaten to erase the jobs of millions of people; the Uberization of work life, where each of us must fend for ourselves in a pitiless market.As is becoming obvious, these companies do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. We need greater regulation, even if it impedes the introduction of new services. If we can\u2019t stop their proposals \u2014 if we can\u2019t say that driverless cars may not be a worthy goal, to give just one example \u2014 then are we in control of our society? We need to break up these online monopolies because if a few people make the decisions about how we communicate, shop, learn the news, again, do we control our own society?Out of curiosity, the other day I searched \u201ccellphones\u201d on Google. Before finding even a mildly questioning article about cellphones, I paged down through ads for phones and lists of phones for sale, guides to buying phones and maps with directions to stores that sell phones, some 20 results in total. Somewhere, a pair of idealistic former graduate students must be saying: \u201cSee! I told you so!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Said to Order Luxembourg to Collect Back Taxes From Amazon", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials will order Luxembourg to collect back taxes from the online retail giant Amazon, a source with knowledge of the decision said Tuesday, the latest in a series of moves where Brussels has sought to flex its regulatory muscle over Silicon Valley.It was not clear how much Luxembourg would be ordered to reclaim, according to the source, who did not want to be identified discussing information that was not yet public. Officials in Luxembourg and the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, declined to comment.The actions have highlighted the heightened scrutiny faced by low-tax nations in the European Union. Those countries, critics argue, help multinationals funnel revenues from larger markets in order to lower their overall tax bill. Such behavior has infuriated larger countries like France, whose budgets have been squeezed in recent years.At the time, the commission said that, in a deal struck in 2003, authorities in Luxembourg had conferred \u201can advantage on Amazon.\u201d The commission added that the \u201cadvantage is obtained every year and ongoing,\u201d and that it \u201cis also granted in a selective manner.\u201dAmazon does business across the 28-nation bloc, but lists its European headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000. The agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg effectively capped the amount of tax Amazon paid, and relied on a method called transfer pricing, according to the commission.Transfer pricing has long been used by multinational companies to assign profits to different units, depending on factors like their role in the overall business and assets. But, according to the commission, these rules are harder to apply for technology companies, because their assets, like intellectual property, are intangible.European regulators have claimed that Amazon sent most of its European revenue from one unit in Luxembourg to a separate subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax in the country. As a result, it was able to reduce the profit it generated from its European operations and cut its tax bill, the commission said.It is not illegal in the European Union for countries to try to lure businesses with low tax rates. But offering special deals to companies that are not available to their competitors can amount to what is known as illegal state aid.Both Amazon and Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry have previously denied that the online retail giant received special tax treatment or benefits.Amazon has already been in the commission\u2019s cross hairs this year for unfair competition.Efforts to curb multinationals from dodging tax have risen in prominence in recent months.Last month, the European Union began considering new proposals broadly aimed at tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.The prominence of Luxembourg has put Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in an awkward position: his role includes oversight of the investigations yet his critics accuse him of having helped turn Luxembourg into a tax haven during his nearly two decades leading that country.Advertisement"}

And the actor created one of the most memorable romances in TV history in the popular BBC series \u201cLuther,\u201d when his London homicide detective in the big tweed overcoat, known by his deputies as \u201chis satanic majesty,\u201d gets in an erotic and psychopathic entanglement with a latter-day Lizzie Borden, played with film-noir panache by the flame-haired Ruth Wilson.Mr. Elba confesses that he got jittery during his sex scene with Ms. Winslet because he hasn\u2019t done that many. \u201cI was a bit nervous because it was Kate Winslet, number one,\u201d he says, slyly, and her breasts were exposed. \u201cDo I look, do I not look? Am I supposed to kiss?\u201dIn a world where most movies disappoint and true stars are rare, Mr. Elba is magnetic. He is tall and muscular, and before he hit the big time as the drug lord Stringer Bell in \u201cThe Wire,\u201d he was a bouncer (and pot dealer) at the comedy club Carolines on Broadway, sometimes living in his Chevy Astro van.\u201cReally nice velvety seats,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI miss that little thing. Honestly, if I found one, I\u2019d definitely buy it and ship it back to France to my little house out there.\u201dHe is leaner than he looks on screen, with a small hoop earring, a gray-flecked beard and elaborately tattooed arms. A tree climbs his upper arm. \u201cI have a spiritual connection to trees,\u201d he says. \u201cI kind of use trees as a place to pray.\u201dHis daughter\u2019s name, Isan, is also tattooed on his arm. (She is with him in New York, upstairs in his hotel suite.) And he has a line of a song inked: \u201cThis train carries no wrongdoers,\u201d to indicate that he does not want the people in his life to let him down. He is wearing a snug gray polo shirt and black jeans from his own clothing collection, with a small \u201cIE\u201d emblazoned.When Amy Pascal was head of Sony, she suggested that Mr. Elba might take over the James Bond role if Daniel Craig ever \u201chung up his tuxedo.\u201d As a producer of \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d Ms. Pascal said that they cast Mr. Elba as the lawyer because \u201cif you had to put yourself in someone\u2019s hands, whose hands would you want? He is like the best version of masculinity. All his complicated contradictions make every character he plays fascinating. Maybe it\u2019s the way he walks, like his legs are more powerful than anyone else, like he is gravity. He always seems like he is in the midst of a moral struggle, but he is the calmest one in the room. It\u2019s rare, undeniable movie star stuff.\u201dI remark to him that race seems beside the point in his romantic liaisons on screen.\u201cYeah, my leading ladies have been both black and white and I haven\u2019t thought about it consciously,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, a good friend of mine, a black producer, said to me, \u2018Are you sure about the \u201cMountain\u201d movie, man? Do you think the black audience is going to go for that?\u201d\u2019 (In the book, his character, a surgeon, was white.)He said it had not come up except during a Facebook Live video, when a woman asked if the movie was advocating greater trust between the races during a divisive time in this country.\u201cIf it does, fantastic, but we didn\u2019t think that,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully, you just go and watch a movie about two people falling in love.\u201dNoting that he has starred in several dystopian movies, including the ill-starred \u201cThe Dark Tower,\u201d I wonder if he thinks America is headed toward a racial dystopia under the stewardship of Donald Trump.\u201cI lived in New York before 9/11, and I never felt any real racial tension going on,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018You walk into a bar where everybody knows your name\u2019 type of thing. Then post-9/11, it was a very different tension. You know, you\u2019re fighting an invisible terrorist, so to speak, and now everyone was like, \u2018Who are you and where are you from?\u2019 I could feel the shift and that was part of the reason I moved to L.A., to be honest.\u201dMr. Elba, who played Nelson Mandela in a movie about the South African hero\u2019s life, said he views the racial tension as something \u201cAmerica has to deal with.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s going to change the whole world and make us all be racists,\u201d he says. \u201cI think human beings are smart and freethinking.\u201dGrowing up poor as the son of African immigrants in a part of East London called Canning Town, he says, \u201cit was common to be called a black bastard as you walked down the street. Did it make me a racist against white folks? Not really. The nationalist front had a strong hold in Canning Town, and it was a party that was very vocal about a sort of separatism. I hate to say it, but it was a little bit of a storm in a teacup. Here I am, a product of Canning Town and I\u2019m not that guy that\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s all be separate because I was called a black bastard once.\u201d\u2019\u201cActually,\u201d Mr. Elba says about the uproar, \u201cI personally don\u2019t want to see any more slave films. I think it\u2019s a time that\u2019s been very well documented. \u201812 Years a Slave,\u2019 although a genius movie, I just found it really hard to watch and didn\u2019t want to go back down that road for the sake of entertainment. I think there are a lot more interesting stories that are less covered that we can spend our time on.\u201dI also ask for his response to the kerfuffle when Samuel L. Jackson complained about black British actors getting leads in American movies, such as David Oyelowo playing Martin Luther King Jr. in \u201cSelma\u201d and Daniel Kaluuya in the Jordan Peele horror film, \u201cGet Out.\u201d\u201cThey think they\u2019re better trained, for some reason, than we are because they\u2019re classically trained,\u201d Mr. Jackson told Hot 97, the New York radio station, in March. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the love affair is with all that.\u201d He said he thought that \u201cGet Out,\u201d a movie about white liberal racism, should have featured \u201can American brother who really feels that.\u201dMr. Elba says: \u201cI spoke on this and I spoke quite openly that I was disappointed.\u201d He got a standing ovation when he made a speech to British Parliament last year urging greater diversity in film and television because he could only play so many \u201cbest friends,\u201d \u201cgang leaders\u201d or \u201cathletic types.\u201d (It was around the same time he got snubbed by the Oscars, failing to receive a nomination for his powerful performance as a brutal African warlord with a child army in \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d and wasn\u2019t even invited to the ceremony.)He calls Mr. Jackson \u201ca god\u201d who gets respect \u201cas an actor, black, white, whatever,\u201d but adds: \u201cIt felt like a very stupid thing to say, if I\u2019m really honest and in a time where people are being marginalized, why marginalize us even further by going on about black Americans and English Americans? And to his credit, he read that and apologized. He called and said, \u2018Hey, man. I agree. You\u2019re right, black is black.\u2019 I respect him for actually acknowledging what I said and sort of rethinking it.\u201cAmericans come into England to the theater and play English characters all day long and no one pipes up and says, \u2018Hey, you can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and no one should. It\u2019s called acting for a reason.\u201dI wonder why it\u2019s harder for Americans to get a British accent right than vice versa.\u201cSomething to do with the way the tongue sits in the mouth, believe it or not,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when the English speak, we speak more frontal and it\u2019s harder for Americans to get that sound because the tongue is so much more relaxed. I\u2019ve studied it.\u201dHe did worry about the East Coast accents for \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d however.Just as he was nervous to make love on screen with Ms. Winslet, he says he was nervous to speak the high-velocity words of \u201cthe oracle,\u201d as he calls Mr. Sorkin, especially since it was the writer\u2019s first directing gig.\u201cI thought he\u2019d be super-pedantic and edgy but he was chill,\u201d Mr. Elba says. \u201cSomeone said to him, \u2018We\u2019re going to change lens,\u2019 and he\u2019d say, \u2018Change lens? That\u2019s exactly what I was going to say, let\u2019s change the lens.\u2019 He didn\u2019t pretend to be like a technical genius. He just knows the drama. He really knows words. He knows emotion.\u201dMr. Sorkin also managed not to freak out with him when Mr. Elba engaged in a kickboxing competition in Thailand and England for a documentary days before he arrived, exhausted, in Toronto for shooting.\u201cEveryone was on a knife\u2019s edge, like come on,\u201d Mr. Elba says. \u201c\u2018The truth is, if Idris loses and he gets his face broken or his leg snapped in half, how do we make our movie?\u2019\u201dHe muses: \u201cI think there\u2019s something to be had about testing your fear capacity, something that keeps you alive.\u201d He snaps his fingers. \u201cMaybe it keeps me younger. I think they call that a midlife crisis.\u201dI wonder, given his Parliament speech urging greater diversity in TV and film, including for women, what he made of the recent spat between the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d director, Patty Jenkins, who now holds the record for the biggest United States opening for a film directed by a woman, and James Cameron, who called the movie \u201ca step backward\u201d because Wonder Woman is \u201can objectified icon, and it\u2019s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing.\u201dMr. Cameron got throttled, but he is right that it\u2019s easier for the suits who run Hollywood to accept a gorgeous young woman in a sexy costume than to make movies with middle-aged, non-cartoony heroines struggling with life, the kind Bette Davis and Joan Crawford used to do.\u201cCameron has a point to some degree, but come on!\u201d Mr. Elba says. \u201cLet\u2019s be positive \u2014 it\u2019s a character created for TV in the \u201970s and she kicks ass in the movie. Change is incremental, O.K.? First you can\u2019t have a black guy kissing a white woman. But then you can have a light-skinned black kissing a white woman. And then it changes, you know. So first you can have a lead woman and she is the hero, but she has to be slightly sexualized. It\u2019s going to change.\u201dI ask how he handled the critical drubbing given to \u201cThe Dark Tower,\u201d based on the Stephen King magnum opus, in which he played the Gunslinger. The New York Times\u2019s Manohla Dargis called it \u201can unappealing hash of moviemaking clich\u00e9s\u201d but still praised Mr. Elba\u2019s \u201cirrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t tend to read reviews but this was inescapable,\u201d he says. \u201cCause it made such a big fanfare \u2013 \u2018Dark Tower\u2019 is coming out!\u2019 And the reviews really beat it up. I didn\u2019t take it personally but I was like, ooof, that hurts.\u201dBut the Brit, who comes from a country with much tighter gun-control laws, agonized over taking the part of the interplanetary vigilante, telling Esquire, \u201cI had a clash of conscience with my character. In America, there\u2019s a real awareness of gun culture.\u201d Luther, the London lawman, is about reasoning, not shooting.(Mr. Elba revisited the subject when I reached him after the Las Vegas horror. \u201cYes, I had an internal struggle with the Gunslinger. Given his title, it was impossible to avoid. The human spirit took a meteor-sized hit yesterday, and the world of America is falling off its axis.\u201d)His father once advised him to look people in the eyes. It was the same technique Alfred Hitchcock used when he directed the great actress Eva Marie Saint in her sultry performance opposite Cary Grant in \u201cNorth by Northwest.\u201dIn our A.D.D. planet, it works. Mr. Elba does not look away at his phone, at the waitress when he asks for a knife, at his publicists trying to hustle him along or at his steak salad and steak and eggs. His expressive brown eyes are always on you.His vibe is cool but his career is frenetic. When he\u2019s not starring in movies and \u201cLuther,\u201d he\u2019s directing movies, designing clothes, D.J.-ing in London and Ibiza, and producing his own music, as well as making documentaries about his adventures kickboxing in Thailand and car racing in Ireland. Maybe that\u2019s why his personal life is so turbulent; he has vowed never to marry again.He has had two children \u2014 a 15-year-old girl and a 3-year-old son \u2014 with two makeup artists, one of whom he married, and a brief second marriage to a lawyer. He publicly stepped out with his new girlfriend, Sabrina Dhowre, a former Miss Vancouver, at last month\u2019s debut of \u201cMolly\u2019s Game\u201d at the Toronto International Film Festival. He met her when he went to Vancouver and British Columbia (standing in for Utah) to make \u201cThe Mountain Between Us.\u201d\u201cFalling in love while falling in love,\u201d he says, dreamily.He also experienced that \u201cYou are not the father\u201d moment that can either be the worst or best moment of a man\u2019s life. In a therapeutic moment four years ago, he told a GQ reporter the \u201ctragic, punch-in-the-face\u201d story of how he discovered that the son he thought he had had with a woman he was involved with in Florida was not his.\u201cIt is definitely without a doubt one of the worst things to happen to any person, and I include her,\u201d he tells me about his ex. \u201cBecause whatever she went through and did, she was hoping that I would never find out, and I did. So for all three of us including the boy, it was. \u2026\u201d His voice gets softer with each word until he finally trails off.How did he find out? I ask.\u201cMy mom came and saw us and she said, \u2018That\u2019s not your son,\u201d\u2019 he says, adding: \u201cSo I just did a paternity test.\u201dHe shakes his head ruefully and says that was absolutely not true and that many stories about his relationships are \u201ccompletely wrong,\u201d but that he doesn\u2019t like to fight back in public.\u201cI think I\u2019m the most misunderstood partner ever,\u201d he says, looking distraught. \u201cI\u2019ve had many failed relationships but not because I\u2019m an ass, just because there\u2019s so many complexities to relationships and perhaps I\u2019m very guarded, just like Luther\u2019s guarded. And being guarded, people presume things and I often haven\u2019t corrected them.\u201cThey just have so much of who I am wrong, they feel like I must be a playboy. I must be noncommittal. I must be the kind of guy that jumps in and out. And, you know, I suppose if you look at my history or you know anything about my history or you can read on Google who I was married to or what\u2019s happened, you know, it might appear that way. But it\u2019s completely misunderstood. People think they know about me and my past and my relationships and they don\u2019t. There\u2019s very few people that can say they really, really know me and I can say, \u2018Yes, you really, really know me.\u2019 Very few people. Very few.\u201dI ask him about a rap lyric he wrote that fame brings you to the \u201cdevil\u2019s door.\u201d\u201cI live a duality, do you know what I mean?\u201d he says. \u201cI got an O.B.E. It\u2019s Officer of the British Empire, but I\u2019ve always known it as a British sweetheart, treasured.\u201cBut I\u2019m a naughty boy. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? I sort of live a full life, and naughty. And I\u2019m one knock away from the devil\u2019s door. Because, you know, I\u2019m human, man. But at the same time, I\u2019m honored by my country and I\u2019m like, yeah,\u201d as long as he doesn\u2019t mess up or be a jerk, he says, using raunchier words. \u201cThere\u2019s responsibility to be a leader on the right moral side. Don\u2019t go out there and get coked off your face and get caught in orgies. Not that I would.\u201dI reassure him that Mick Jagger has been knighted, so other naughty boys are in the Queen\u2019s pack of aces. And I wonder if there\u2019s any other challenge on the horizon, noting that he would make a remarkable Othello.\u201cDon\u2019t like the story,\u201d he says brusquely.But why?\u201cJealousy\u2019s a real poison and I\u2019m not into it,\u201d he says.Is that because you get jealous?\u201cIt\u2019s a poison,\u201d he repeats, laughing. As we get ready to leave, I pose the question I know Mr. Elba doesn\u2019t like: \u201cI have to ask about James Bond because George Clooney has now said you would be a \u2018perfect James Bond and it would be a great step forward.\u201d\u2019\u201cGeorge Clooney said that?\u201d Mr. Elba asks with a skeptical grin.\u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the James Bond thing continues to go. I think it\u2019s more about, we just want to have a black guy play James Bond rather than Idris Elba the actor play James Bond. That\u2019s the part that I\u2019m like, \u2018Ugh, come on.\u2019\u201dSo at long last, we need to know: Does he like martinis? Offering his most suave look, Mr. Elba murmurs: \u201cI like them stirred. Not shaken. Jesus Christ, did I just say that out loud?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do the Dunes: Where You Can Ride the Sand", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrendingAnd then there were none.Taking the last sleds to the cashier, I learned it was the second time in two months that they had run out, despite an inventory of 300 sleds and sandboards and a remote location in the San Luis Valley, 250 miles from either Denver or Albuquerque, N.M.As a novice, my sand experience ended up being more R2D2 on Tatooine than Shaun White at the X Games.Even so, it was easy to understand why sand sports have become so popular.There were no lift tickets, no lines, no trails and no trees to avoid. There was spectacular scenery, and the contented feeling of ruling the sandbox.\u201cJust check Google Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cMost dunes are open to sandboarding because it\u2019s nonmotorized.\u201dThe tallest dunes in North America are at Great Sand Dunes National Park, with the highest rising 750 feet.By midmorning during my visit, I was already finding the sand hot through my socks and sandals, so I stayed on the lower dunes, knowing I was unlikely to keep my $20 rental board the full day.Although the breeze kept the air temperature comfortable, I had been warned that the sand can reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon sun.On the lower dunes, the views remained stunning. The dune field stretches for 30 square miles, and to the north and east rise the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.I thought of asking someone to try their board, but people were spread out a considerable distance on the dunes. Whether I was a wimp or wise by sticking to a sled depends upon whom you\u2019re talking to.The sandboards, though, require core and leg strength, and healthy knees.Still, Mr. Beale, 60, thinks it is the superior sport.\u201cWhen you stand up you have more maneuverability,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do jumps, you can slalom. There\u2019s a lot more adrenaline involved.\u201dRegardless of which sport, there are some tips:While you can wear shoes on the sleds, the bindings on the sandboards are designed for socks or surf bootees.Sand dunes are formed by wind, so there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll be peppered by blowing sand. Full-length lightweight clothing will help keep you more comfortable, and cut down on the areas that need sunscreen. Some also recommend goggles to keep sand out of the eyes.On steeper slopes, the sand cascades beneath your feet with every step, meaning you don\u2019t cover much distance for the energy expended. It\u2019s easier to approach the dune from the low side, then walk along the ridge to the slope you want to go down.Plastic sleds, saucers, and cardboard don\u2019t slide on dry sand. (The children I saw trying to slide on garbage bags gave up and just rolled down the hill.) Similarly, snowboards aren\u2019t a good choice for dunes, according to Mr. Beale, who manufactures the wooden sleds and boards rented at the Oasis and elsewhere.Sand sleds have no steering, so Mrs. Ammerman recommends people use their hands in the sand as rudders, assuming it\u2019s not too hot to do so.Lessons in sandboarding are available at Sand Master Park, which opened in 2000 and gets about 20,000 visitors each year.The sand at the park is sculpted with earth moving equipment and ramps, rails and jumps are set up.\u201cWe have everybody from 4-year-olds to 80-year-olds,\u201d said Mrs. Ammerman, who didn\u2019t have a count for the number of rentals last season.Still, she said, sand sports aren\u2019t for everyone, and cites her 62-year-old mother, who owns the Oasis, as an example.\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t like sand dunes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hot and she gets dirty.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Tech Is Starting to Make Me Uneasy", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s gadget season in the tech world. Think of it like New York Fashion Week, untucked white-man edition.But despite the baubles and billion-dollar office parks, I\u2019m really not feeling it this year. The technology industry is still exciting; it still packs the capacity for surprise. But where the surprise once felt like Christmas morning, it\u2019s now like the entering-the-darkened-basement scene of a horror movie.Technology has crossed over to the dark side. It\u2019s coming for you; it\u2019s coming for us all, and we may not survive its advance.I\u2019ve been covering tech for nearly 20 years; for the past three, since I inherited the State of the Art column from David Pogue, I\u2019ve explored for The New York Times how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future.Not only am I lucky enough to have my dream job, but it\u2019s perfectly timed, too. In the years that I\u2019ve written the column, the technology business has swallowed the world, becoming by far the largest and most consequential industry on the globe. Silicon Valley today is like Wall Street in the 1980s, or the defense industry in the 1950s: enjoying gargantuan growth and shaping much of the rest of the rest of the economy, not to mention art, culture, politics, education and healthcare.So why am I feeling so bad about tech?Well, who isn\u2019t, right? Look around you. It\u2019s difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when smartphones and social networks might be ruining the world. The technologies we were most excited about 10 years ago are now implicated in just about every catastrophe of the day. (See how Russian propagandists used Facebook and Twitter to inject false narratives into the news media last year.)These companies are not evil; they\u2019re all led and staffed by smart, well-meaning people who believe that technology can radically improve the world. But as I argue in the series, we have not, as a society, come to grips with the scope of their control over our lives. And we don\u2019t have many good ways to limit it, if we decided that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do.A lot of these worries aren\u2019t new. Though Silicon Valley runs on heedless optimism, much of The Times\u2019s coverage has long been properly skeptical and critical of the implications of new tech. Consider the evil of \u201crevenge porn,\u201d or the rise in accidents caused by drivers looking at their phones. I\u2019ve shared other fears: In 2008, I wrote a book predicting that the internet would lead us into a \u201cpost-fact\u201d world.Still, until this year, the problems caused by tech felt manageable \u2014 bumps on the road to a better tomorrow that we\u2019d eventually figure out. I managed to retain the capacity to be viscerally excited by tech, to instantly fall for its potential and possibilities. And I bought into it personally. You should see my house: I\u2019ve outfitted it with every kind of doodad you can imagine, including cameras that record everything we do, lights that switch on by voice, a toilet you have to plug in and, once, an electronic trashcan. (Manual is better, trust me.) There\u2019s a lot about it I now can\u2019t live without; every time I want to snap a picture of my kids, which is maybe five times an hour, I\u2019m grateful for the smartphone.And yet now it all comes freighted with worry. That\u2019s what\u2019s different. In 2007, when Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone, just about everyone greeted the new device as an unalloyed good. I was one of them. Here was a genuinely new thing that would Make Your Life Better, we all thought: It would be convenient, it would be fun, it wasn\u2019t serious or dangerous or globe-shattering. That\u2019s no longer true.The State of the Art, today, is a bag of mixed emotions. Tech might improve everything. And it\u2019s probably also terrible in ways we\u2019re only just starting to understand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Warner: Tech Millionaire Who Became Tech\u2019s Critic in Congress", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "The Democratic senator from Virginia is emblematic of the shifting politics for big technology companies, which face congressional hearings this week.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mark Warner was fired up. Sitting in his basement office at the Capitol last week, he leaned forward in his chair, waved his hands in the air and pounded his fingers on the coffee table.He was talking about how some of the biggest American technology companies, like Facebook, Google and Twitter, were used to spread foreign propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. And he wanted to make clear that those businesses had made major mistakes before and after the election.Not only were Russian-linked accounts able to take advantage of the services, Mr. Warner said. The tech companies also took months to hand over information about those accounts. And he is still not convinced, he said, that the businesses are revealing everything they know about how their products were manipulated.\u201cThey\u2019ve grown so quickly,\u201d said Mr. Warner, 62, a Democrat from Virginia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019ve fully realized the implications of all their power.\u201dThis week, Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will push for new answers. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify at congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday about the election and the power of their platforms.Lawmakers are increasingly taking a critical tone with Silicon Valley, with Mr. Warner among the harshest. He has already pushed a bill requiring the companies to disclose who paid for digital political ads, the biggest legislative effort so far to regulate the companies.Mr. Warner\u2019s position is a sharp reversal. Before entering politics, he built a fortune that at one time was estimated at around $200 million as a technology and telecommunications investor and executive. His political identity, first as governor of Virginia and then as a senator, has been wrapped in promises to bring 21st century jobs. He has a broad and close network of tech executives and investors.Mr. Warner is emblematic of the shifting politics for technology.\u201cThat is a poor attitude for American companies,\u201d Mr. Chambliss added. \u201cMark will make sure this issue is highlighted because it needs to stop.\u201d\u201cTwitter is taking an appropriate and welcome step,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said last week.The companies say the internal investigations and answering lawmakers\u2019 questions are a top priority. In their announcements on voluntary ad disclosures, Twitter and Facebook said their stricter policies for who can place political ads and promises to make those purchases public are signs of their commitment to correcting their mistakes.\u201cWe look forward to answering lawmakers\u2019 questions,\u201d said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy for Facebook, in a statement. \u201cWe take this issue very seriously and think it\u2019s important Congress gets the full picture of what happened, including what we know about Russian activity on our platform, and is able to share its assessment with the American public.\u201dBut lawmakers said the companies, who have been interacting privately for months, still have a long way to go.Last week, congressional aides said the online giants were pushing back against lawmakers. The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday. Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news. In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues. And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.\u201cIf their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies. The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses. Some are also afraid of crossing other party members or President Trump, who regularly play down Russian interference in the election.Republicans have slowly begun calling for more scrutiny of the companies. But lawmakers who are more oriented toward free markets have been reluctant to regulate the rapidly evolving industry. Other top regulators, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, are also considered unlikely to take strong action against the industry.That has made it easier for Mr. Warner to assert himself as a leading voice about the power of the tech companies \u2014 as unexpected as it may be.Mr. Warner accumulated his wealth with an early investment in the cellular service provider Nextel, which was sold to Sprint in 2005 for $35 billion. Mr. Warner then became a start-up investor at Columbia Capital, which had an office in Alexandria, Va. He used his fortune to run for governor of Virginia, talking on the campaign trail about bringing work force training and tech-oriented economic development to rural parts of the state. After serving a term, he was elected to the Senate in 2008.And even with his recent criticism of the industry, he regularly taps a broad network of tech executives and investors for counsel.During the summer, Steve Case, the founder of AOL, stayed at Mr. Warner\u2019s vacation home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. For years, the two have met regularly to talk about techology-related policy issues, like how artificial intelligence could alter the future of labor.But during this year\u2019s trip, they discussed the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s Russia investigation and the power of social media platforms and their role in the election.\u201cHis thinking has evolved,\u201d Mr. Case said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m sure this has some benefit with his profile, all things being equal, I think he has approached this with some reluctance because he\u2019d rather be focused on issues like the future of work.\u201dAnd Mr. Warner sees no contradiction in his evolution to being considered a sharp prod of Silicon Valley.\u201cLook, I\u2019m pro-tech. I\u2019m pro-innovation,\u201d he said, standing and shuffling side to side like a basketball player on defense. On the bookshelf near him was a textbook, \u201cScience and Engineering,\u201d and a small business self-help book called \u201cGrow Regardless: Of Your Business\u2019s Size, Your Industry or the Economy ... and Despite the Government!\u201dHe went on: \u201cWhat I fear is 2018. If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I.,\u201d he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.\u201cThere is too much at stake,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Willing to Do Everything,\u2019 Mothers Defend Sons Accused of Sexual Assault", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour women met late last month at a restaurant in a Twin Cities suburb, where they spoke for hours, so intently their waiter had trouble getting their drink orders.Each had a son who had been accused at college of sexual assault. One was expelled and another suspended. The other two were cleared, yet one had contemplated suicide and the other was so crushed he had not returned to school.The women had been meeting regularly to share notes and commiserate. Now, over red wine in a corner booth, they were finally savoring a victory.\u201cWhat she is doing with this issue is spot on,\u201d one of the women, Sherry Warner Seefeld, said.And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women: their own mothers.The group holds twice-yearly meetings, where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers.Away from the public eye, families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts, so that other colleges and employers cannot see them.Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm, and used her political connections as a teachers\u2019 union leader, to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son\u2019s three-year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex.\u201cI was willing to do everything and anything,\u201d Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case.The mothers\u2019 resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons\u2019 accusers had felt hurt.Their sons may not have been falsely accused, the mothers said, but they had been wrongly accused. They made a distinction.One mother, Judith, said her son had been expelled after having sex with a student who said she had been too intoxicated to give consent.\u201cIn my generation, what these girls are going through was never considered assault,\u201d Judith said. \u201cIt was considered, \u2018I was stupid and I got embarrassed.\u2019\u201dMs. DeVos issued temporary guidance for colleges last month and will invite public comment while developing permanent regulations. Most significantly so far, she has lifted the requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d in deciding whether to uphold a charge of sexual misconduct. Colleges are now free to demand more convincing evidence, a move that the mothers and other advocates for the accused had called for, saying that students should not be punished in cases where there is some doubt about the accusation.The most active mothers said they stepped forward because they often had more time than their husbands, and because they made a strategic decision that they could be effective on the issue of sexual assault precisely because they are women and, as some described themselves, feminists. \u201cWe recognized that power,\u201d Ms. Seefeld said.Many women, however, feel exactly the opposite way.A number of women\u2019s groups and victims\u2019 advocates have argued that a tougher standard of proof will discourage women from coming forward. They have not been shy about expressing their view of the mothers as \u201crape deniers\u201d and misogynists who blame women for inviting male violence against them.\u201cIt is of course an immensely difficult thing to believe somebody you love could rape or harm another person,\u201d Ms. Davidson said.But, she said of the mothers, \u201cI think it\u2019s the wrong thing for them to do to try and push back an entire movement.\u201dOf a dozen mothers who were interviewed, almost all asked to be identified by their first names only. They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case. The mothers obsessively type their sons\u2019 names into Google, and are relieved when their cases do not come up.Some of the mothers remember the moment they learned their sons had been accused as vividly as other people remember hearing that planes had struck the World Trade Center.Alison was pushing her cart down the aisle at a supermarket, looking at Tide detergent, when she got the call from her younger son. He had left home for college for the first time about seven weeks before.\u201cI think I have a problem,\u201d her son said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad.\u201dShe felt a flash of irritation.\u201cHow many times have I told you, you need to keep it zippered,\u201d she said she told him.Then the gravity of the situation sank in. \u201cI need to hire a lawyer,\u201d she thought.A female student had told the university police that she had been sexually assaulted at an apartment near campus.As Alison tells it, the woman had propositioned her son and consented to sex. She learned more about her 19-year-old son\u2019s intimate behavior than any mother would want to know, and found herself talking about it \u201cas if it were the grocery list,\u201d she recalled.Officials at the university declined to comment on the case, citing student confidentiality rules.According to university documents provided by Alison, her son was cleared. Additionally, a grand jury declined to indict him, she said. But, Alison contends, the investigation should never even have gotten that far, and the damage was already done.Her son had become a pariah, dropped by his friends and called a rapist by women on campus. The semester after he was cleared he called home, sobbing, to say he could no longer take it and was dropping out, she said.Five years later, at 24, he has not received a diploma and is trying to ease back into college life by taking courses online.Alison and her son were among the delegation that met with Ms. DeVos in July. \u201cIt was very solemn,\u201d Alison said. \u201cIt was as if we all, everyone in the room, had attended the same funeral together.\u201dJudith, whose son was expelled, said that at first her son did not tell her about the complaint against him, thinking he could handle it alone. She found out when he was taken to a hospital, suicidal.She described herself as a lifelong Democrat and feminist who went to college in the 1970s at the height of the sexual revolution and women\u2019s liberation movements. Her husband and their two sons were \u201csuper respectful\u201d of women, she said.\u201cWe don\u2019t really need to teach our sons not to rape,\u201d she said.Four years after being kicked out of school, she said, her son is leading a \u201cdouble life,\u201d unable to confide in colleagues at work, and avoiding college classmates and his hometown.Gloria Davidson, whose daughter, Jessica, runs End Rape on Campus, said that as the mother of a 21-year-old son, she could empathize with the mothers of accused students \u2014 to a point.\u201cAny mother is watching out for the children, that\u2019s what mothers do,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. \u201cBut I think all mothers should get the facts and open their eyes to what could have happened or not.\u201dFew mothers have been as public and assertive as Ms. Seefeld. In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota. Mr. Warner contended that the sex was consensual, but he was suspended and banned from campus for three years.His mother leveraged the connections she had developed over years as a high school psychology and sociology teacher in Fargo, and as a union leader. She contacted the State Board of Higher Education and visited state legislators.Hearing that the university was about to start a fund-raising drive, and thus would not want bad publicity, Ms. Seefeld said, she emailed its president about 9 p.m. one night. She wrote that she had hired a lawyer to look into suing the university, and a public relations firm to help her publicize her son\u2019s case, she said. \u201cWithin 30 minutes I heard from the president,\u201d she said, and he told her the case would be reviewed.A spokesman for the university declined to comment. But university documents provided by Ms. Seefeld show that the school did review the verdict, and nullified it because of a new development: The police said that they had found inconsistencies in the accuser\u2019s account and that some witnesses had contradicted it. They issued a warrant for her arrest on a charge of filing a false police report. (The woman left the state and has not been arrested. She did not respond to telephone messages.)Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students. She said the group does not want to attack women. But if the mothers do not defend their sons, she said, who will?\u201cI just thought it was so wrong, and I thought how could anybody let this stand,\u201d she said of her son\u2019s punishment. \u201cAnd pretty much the most significant weapon I had was the weapon of public opinion, so that was the weapon I was wielding the hardest.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s New Gadgets Come With a Big Helping of A.I.", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s unveiling of new smartphones, smart speakers and other gadgets had all the makings of a typical technology product launch: a fawning crowd of superfans, skeptical journalists, slick product videos, not-so-subtle jabs at the competition, and overly romanticized descriptions of design choices, colors and materials.But one nagging question lingered for Google, which makes nearly all of its money from selling online advertisements: Is it finally serious about making devices?On Wednesday, Google did its best to demonstrate its commitment. It introduced two new Pixel smartphones, Google Home speakers both small and large, a laptop running the company\u2019s Chrome software, a new virtual reality headset and wireless headphones.But Google\u2019s pitch for why its hardware is different had little to do with the hardware itself.Unlike the way an Apple event is conducted \u2014 usually chock-full of talk about chip speeds and screen resolutions \u2014 Google didn\u2019t spend much time on product specifications. Instead, its focus was on artificial intelligence. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, spent the first 10 minutes explaining how artificial intelligence was helping Google Maps and its translations.Mr. Pichai said that as an \u201cA.I. first\u201d company, this is a \u201cunique moment in time\u201d for Google to combine hardware, software and artificial intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s radically rethinking how computing should work,\u201d he said.Google executives said it has been getting harder to find new hardware breakthroughs like bigger and better screens, but they believe significant improvements will come from artificial intelligence software that is developing at a faster clip than physical components.Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president of hardware, compared the company\u2019s strategy for building devices to search and email. Google was not the first search engine and Gmail was hardly the first free web-based email provider \u2014 but both services reimagined what those products should do.On Wednesday, Google demonstrated how every hardware product had received an A.I. makeover. The Pixel smartphones come with an image-recognition app called Lens that can help users find information just by pointing a camera at a movie poster or an ad. The new \u201csmart speaker\u201d uses artificial intelligence to adjust its sound for the layout of a room. And new wireless headphones allow for instant translation of different languages.The question of Google\u2019s commitment to hardware is a testament to the challenges of competing against devices made by Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Most other companies have found it hard to turn a profit in that product fight, and a flop can follow a company around for years \u2014 both in money and reputation lost.It is also a recognition of Google\u2019s history of fits and starts with devices. The company once acquired Motorola, only to sell it a few years later to Lenovo. It bought Nest and Dropcam, but the introduction of new products from those home device companies seemed to stagnate after they joined Google, now operating under the parent company, Alphabet.Whether Google\u2019s device push sticks over the long haul remains to be seen, but its checkbook for hardware is still open.The deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval, early next year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Dear Helene: Could You Not Wear Beachwear on Sunday A.M. Talk Shows?\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The envelope was innocuous enough, addressed to me at the \u201cNY Times\u201d in New York, though some soul in the mail department had obviously opened it, marked it \u201cpersonal\u201d and forwarded it to our Washington office.It was May 3 \u2014 five months ago. I was strangely happy to receive the letter, since most hate mail comes via email and Twitter, and handwritten (or hand-typed) letters \u2014 at least the ones that aren\u2019t from people in correctional facilities \u2014 usually say nice things.Wrong. \u201cDear Helene: You have the worst wardrobe of all the newscasters, male or female, on all of the networks and cable channels. Could you PLEASE get some help and start wearing jackets to cover up your fat arms? Could you not wear beach wear on Sunday a.m. talk shows? What are you thinking? Get a consultant to help you, please!!\u201dIt was signed: \u201cA viewer who is driven insane by your attire.\u201dWhat the heck? Okay, so I am not Tyra Banks, but I have always considered myself a fashionista by the low standards of the print journalism profession. That was one of the reasons I went the newspaper route instead of TV. I had taken a TV course in college and realized quickly that the time I was spending working to modulate my voice, put on lipstick and pour myself into shift dresses was time away from actual reporting. I quickly scurried back to print, where I \u2014 alongside my kinky locks, dangly earrings and cargo pants paired with Prada-outlet-purchased heels \u2014 was not only accepted but viewed as fashionable.Except now, as more print newspaper reporters are showing up on TV talking about stories, new avenues of criticism are opening up. It\u2019s not just emails complaining that I spelled \u201csergeant\u201d wrong or called a Marine \u201csoldier.\u201d (I cover the Pentagon so there\u2019s a lot of that in my bloopers file.)These days, my mail includes telephone messages wondering why I wore a white blouse to talk about Chuck Hagel getting fired as defense secretary on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d emails wondering whether I\u2019m wearing the same necklace as the late Gwen Ifill on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and Facebook messages from family friends purporting to be proud I\u2019m on TV while also offering up commentary that I shouldn\u2019t wear my favorite black leather jacket when talking about Iran\u2019s nuclear program.But the beachwear and fat arms hand-typed letter stood out. I googled the return address and found a satellite street image of an ugly red pickup truck parked in a nondescript yard, which told me, well, nothing actually.I love my beachwear \u2014 these cute completely insubstantial crocheted cover-ups that come to the elbows. I have eight of them in different colors, all purchased on Folegandros, this island in Greece that I go to every summer, for $15 each. The whole reason I buy them is to cover up my fat arms on TV. Apparently I was damned if I did and damned if I didn\u2019t.How had Mr. or Mrs. Red Pickup Truck deduced that? After parading the letter around the office in a futile search for reassurance from my guffawing colleagues \u2014 do men get such missives? \u2014 I took to social media where my Facebook friends were bound to do a better job of buoying me up.Over the past months, looking for people (other than myself for eating too many bowls of Jollof rice) to blame for the letter, I\u2019ve settled on the city of Washington D.C., where I live and work.The city is too conservative for my haphazard style. Go to Capitol Hill and it\u2019s a sea of Ann Taylor low-heeled pumps and Talbot\u2019s suits.In recent years, Washington has played host to two First Ladies \u2014 Michelle Obama and now Melania Trump \u2014 who have pushed the envelope of what women wear here. But remember the stir when Mrs. Obama bared her arms in her first official photo as First Lady? Or the recent social media storm when Mrs. Trump wore stilettos to a hurricane?Clearly, I\u2019ve decided, Washington can\u2019t handle too much fashion forwardness. A couple of years ago, I tried on a pair of gorgeous deep red laced-up ankle boots in Paris, and the guy at the cash register stopped me as I was handing him my credit card.\u201cYou live in Washington? You will wear these there?\u201d he said, causing me to pause.I sighed. \u201cOkay, give me the black pair.\u201d I feel bitter about it every time I put on those black boots.My friend and I laughed about it, although I was secretly mad, and she sent me a pair of earrings that didn\u2019t dangle to wear next time I went on TV. I promised her I would wear them.But of course I didn\u2019t.Advertisement"}

But what if there is more to the house than your eye can see?A cracked pipe underground, a litigious neighbor, a long list of code violations \u2014 these are the kinds of red flags that buyers should look out for to make sure that seemingly ideal house doesn\u2019t turn out to be a money pit or some other type of real estate nightmare.In 2015, Dena Ferrara Driscoll thought she had found her new home: a four-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath in South Philadelphia \u2014 an older house but one that looked well maintained and perfect for her, her husband and two children.\u201cWe weren\u2019t too worried something big was going to come up,\u201d said Ms. Driscoll, 33, a grant writer for the School District of Philadelphia.Unfortunately, they were wrong. \u201cWhen the inspector came up from the basement, he had the grimmest look on his face,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. The reason: a cracked sewer pipe. Replacing it, the couple was told, would cost between $10,000 and $20,000.\u201cAn older woman lived in the house,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cShe flushes the toilet only so many times a day. But a family of four? We were definitely going to create a problem with this sewer pipe.\u201dTheir request for a credit to cover the work was denied, so they moved on and wound up buying a smaller house in the same neighborhood, but one where they didn\u2019t have to worry about finding sewage in the basement.Underground problems, bowed foundations, litigious homeowner associations and flips that are actually flops: A lot of things could put the brakes on a home purchase, and they might not be the things you notice while you\u2019re at the open house. Here are three categories of red flags to keep in mind while you\u2019re looking for that perfect house.STRUCTURAL OR UNDERGROUND ISSUESFinding an inspector who will be thorough is crucial once you\u2019ve made an offer on a home. And just as you would ask around for recommendations for a broker, get advice on inspectors, too. A great home inspector will point out every single little thing wrong with a property; one that isn\u2019t as good could miss a flaw that leads to big repair bills down the line.When reviewing an inspection report, keep in mind that while a faulty outlet or a leaky faucet may be a nuisance \u2013 as can be negotiations with a seller over who will cover the repair \u2013 they\u2019re often not enough to kill a deal. It\u2019s those things that can\u2019t really be fixed, or can be fixed only for a hefty price, that should have buyers reconsidering their dream homes.Water intrusion is another red flag because of how destructive water can be, he added. Sometimes there is an easy fix: If gutters are clogged, clean them out; if downspouts are emptying at the foundation, reorient them.\u201cBut if you live next to a river or creek that always overflows \u2014 well, you know that\u2019s going to be a long-term problem,\u201d Mr. Lesh said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when.\u201dIn 2011, water stopped a home purchase for Marcia Layton Turner, now 52, and her family on a house in Pittsford, N.Y. The house was the right size and had extras that made it appealing, like a barn that Ms. Turner, a writer, pictured using as a home office. But she and her husband were concerned that they could smell mildew in a basement guest room. They also spotted a dehumidifier running in another part of the basement.The home inspector raised a flag about water issues too. He noted that one of the basement walls was cold and damp, which he said was a sign of drainage problems. The inspector recommended adding a French drain system, which would take water away from the house, so they lowered their offer to factor in the cost. Before they could negotiate with the seller, another buyer came in with a better offer. The couple eventually bought another home in the same town.A few years later, Ms. Turner\u2019s husband, who runs a hearth-products store, was back in the home they nearly bought to give an estimate on converting a wood stove into a gas stove. The homeowner told him that they had spent about $40,000 on repairs, including installing a French drain. \u201cHe said something to the effect of \u2018Be glad you didn\u2019t buy it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Turner said.Other structural or underground items Mr. Lesh said to look out for in the inspection report: lead paint and asbestos. If the inspection does not include sending a camera down drainage and sewer lines, he recommended paying extra for it, especially if the home is older or near trees whose roots could be damaging pipes.Another potential issue: unremediated oil tanks, which Lesh said are a big issue on the East Coast, because so many homes there use oil for heat. Removing oil tanks and cleaning up a spill can be expensive and complicated if a state environmental agency gets involved.DOCUMENTSFor homes in areas that are near water or have flooded in the past, buyers will also need a certificate that states that the house is at the proper elevation. If you\u2019re shopping for a house in a beach town, it might also make sense to avoid the only house on the block that has not been elevated.For a home that has traded hands frequently in a short period of time, she suggested looking at how much it sold for each time. If each sale was at a significantly higher dollar figure, the turnover could be a sign that the property is in a hot neighborhood, not that something is wrong with it.For a house that has been flipped, Ms. Mendenhall advised buyers to demand proof that all contractors who have worked on the house have been paid. Otherwise, contractors could put a lien on the home \u2013 which would affect the new owner, not the flipper who stiffed them.But flips aren\u2019t always a red flag, Ms. Mendenhall noted: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. In many instances, somebody has taken the time and care and made an old home livable to a new family.\u201d The quality of construction, however, should be scrutinized.In 2012, Nikki Carpenter, 32, a research foundation grant manager, fell in love with a 100-year-old home in Scotch Plains, N.J., that had been abandoned for several years before being bought by an investor and renovated. Not only was it in a town that she and her husband, Joshua Pellittieri, loved, it was also big enough for their expanding family: She was seven months pregnant with their second child when they made the offer. And it looked beautiful.Their inspector, however, saw through that. The inspection report came back with a list of big problems, including standing water in the basement; a deck not built to code; a connector from the outside water main to the inside plumbing that had been installed backward; and hookups for a washer and dryer, but no drain for the washer or vent for the dryer. The inspector also found evidence of improperly removed asbestos.The sellers \u201cclaimed they had no idea there were so many things wrong with it,\u201d Ms. Carpenter said. She and her husband didn\u2019t try negotiating a lower price, or ask the sellers to make repairs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really trust them at that point, and didn\u2019t trust them to do anything further,\u201d she said. They stayed in their apartment, which they rented month to month, and eventually bought a different house in Scotch Plains.NEIGHBORSYou can\u2019t always pick your neighbors if they move in after you do, but you can get an idea of who is already there before you move in.\u201cAsk them how long ago major improvements were done, how it was paid for, and was it through special assessment or reserves,\u201d he said. If the association has been putting off maintenance or doing big-ticket repairs like a roof replacement or HVAC upgrade, buyers could be on the hook for a lot of additional costs very quickly.Also be wary of any board or association that has often been sued or that does a lot of suing, warned Ms. Giantomasi, the real estate lawyer. Lenders will often balk at financing such purchases \u2014 and maybe these are not the kind of people you want for neighbors, either.If the home is not in an association or co-op, look as closely as you can at neighboring properties and how well they are maintained. Hang out on the block at different times of day to get a feel for what it\u2019s like after school lets out, at night and during morning rush hour.If the inspection report reveals issues caused by a neighbor\u2019s property \u2014 like a crack in that shared driveway or water from the neighbor\u2019s land draining into the home that is for sale \u2014 buyers or their brokers should see how open the neighbors are to making the repair before the sale goes through.That could sink a deal for the seller. But it could also save the buyer a world of headaches if the property \u2013 and the problem \u2013 eventually becomes their own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wildfires Spared the Vineyards, but the Wines Could Suffer", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut as the smoke has begun to clear in recent days, those who depend on grape-growing and winemaking for a living have been relieved to find that the fires largely spared one crucial element in their path: the vineyards.Throughout the most beleaguered parts of Napa and Sonoma Counties, the fires have left scorched, blackened fields and the occasional smoldering log. Almost invariably, though, they have left vineyards, the region\u2019s most precious resource, intact, with at worst a singeing around the fringes.Still, several days of visits to the worst-hit parts of Napa and Sonoma Counties indicated that despite a communal sense of relief that the worst had been dodged, the fires have created serious concerns for the near future. Potential damage to the grapes, which may take months or years to show itself, could affect the supply and quality of some of this year\u2019s vintage.A map shows the origin and extent of a fire that burned 5,200 buildings in hours.\u201cWe have a couple of weeks when the world is interested in us, and then the next disaster will strike and we\u2019ll be on our own,\u201d he said.A less tangible concern is that the roiling smoke that hovered over the region could somehow damage grapes that were not yet harvested.Initial reports after the fires began suggested that much of the vintage had already been harvested. That was true of the white grapes. But many fine-wine producers in Napa and Sonoma still had red grapes hanging \u2014 particularly those for the riper, more voluptuous style that dominate in California, especially in Napa Valley. For many producers, as much as 30 percent of their Bordeaux varieties like cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc, and Rh\u00f4ne grapes like grenache, had yet to be harvested.One thing is clear: A perception among consumers that the 2017 vintage is tainted would be bad for business, leading some producers to avoid discussing whether they still had grapes on the vines.Thirty percent of his estate cabernet grapes were still hanging a few days into the fires. Like many other producers, Frog\u2019s Leap is processing the grapes picked after the fires started separately from those harvested before so that any potential taint will be confined.The issue is more complicated than smoke residue settling on the skins of grapes. The interaction with smoke can cause chemical compounds to form within the grapes. At first, these compounds may be undetectable by taste or smell. They may become volatile during fermentation, or it may not be until much later, months or years, that they become evident.Winemakers cannot simply wash the grapes. Instead, they send grapes, juice or wine to laboratories, which test for indications of these compounds.Fear of smoke taint can force changes in winemaking protocols. Frog\u2019s Leap depends on naturally occurring yeast to ferment its red grapes, Mr. Williams said, but manufactured yeast can be purchased that is said to either mask the smoke taint \u2014 if it exists \u2014 with fruity flavors or curtail the release of the smoky flavors.In addition, the grapes can be handled more delicately than usual. Ordinarily, Frog\u2019s Leap would pump the fermenting juice over the grape skins regularly to extract as much color, flavor and texture as possible. The skins remain with the juice until fermentation is complete, and then they are pressed to extract a little bit more. But with these grapes, Mr. Williams suggested, Frog\u2019s Leap could do fewer pumpovers and press the skins before fermentation is complete. This might lead to other issues, like a loss of color and flavor.Still other decisions loom. Producers may decide to use more heavily charred barrels to age these wines. The char will cause the wine to taste more oaky, but, since oak contains the same active compound found in smoke taint, albeit in a more agreeable form, it might mask any potential flaw.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make hard decisions if we want to make great wines,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThirty percent of our cabernet business is a big hit.\u201dReminders of the fires are all over the wine country. Wide swatches of umber dirt \u2014 fire breaks bulldozed through fields and woods, to cordon the flames off \u2014 scar the countryside. The bulldozers have carved up numerous paved mountain roads, their metal tracks leaving ruts that will shake passenger vehicles for some time to come.Sam Coturri worked to save his parents\u2019 house. With colleagues, he dug a fire break with a backhoe and hosed down the wooden structure. He has hired a crisis counselor to help the 100 vineyard management employees, some of whom lost homes and many of whom are immigrants.\u201cI\u2019ve always known how much I owe to a largely immigrant work force,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned this week how much of a responsibility I have to them as well.\u201dAs with any agricultural enterprise, the work of making wine must go on regardless of interruptions, even one as profound and traumatic as the fires. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the bigger story yet,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cWe have to take care of our people, make the best wine we can possibly make and get the vineyards ready for winter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Testify as Washington Focuses on Russia: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We\u2019re watching SoftBank to see if the Japanese conglomerate really wants Sprint to walk away from a T-Mobile deal, or if it\u2019s all merely negotiating tactics. More on that in a minute.Russia is Topic A in the Senate today, especially with lawyers for Facebook, Google and Twitter set to testify before the Judiciary Committee. We expect Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, and other members to ask hard questions about:\u2022 When the tech giants knew the full extent of Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 election\u2022 What they intend to do to stop that from happening again \u2014 a tricky job for companies seeking to both preserve free speech and ward off further regulation.Russian agents intending to sow discord among American citizens disseminated inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google\u2019s YouTube service.Today, the rise of populist movements in both parties has forced a reckoning around the concentration of economic power in big businesses. Populist conservatives are particularly hostile to big tech, given its size and pervasive influence, as well as its support for immigration rights and other causes that clash with their economic nationalism.Let\u2019s face it: Despite the impending tax plan rollout and the picking of a nominee for Federal Reserve chairman, Washington will still be largely talking about the criminal charges that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates face in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.Some of those conversations will concern Tom Barrack, one of President Trump\u2019s closest advisers, who has emerged as connected to the two men. Could that see him pushed out of the White House inner circle?Some White House advisers are unhappy with Thomas J. Barrack Jr., Trump\u2019s longtime friend and chair of his inauguration, whom they hold responsible for keeping Gates in the Trump orbit long after Manafort resigned as campaign chairman in August 2016, according to people familiar with the situation. Barrack has been Gates\u2019s patron of late, steering political work to him and, until Monday, employing him as director of the Washington office of his real estate investment company.\u201cIn the midst of such a major investigation, it\u2019s inappropriate for me to have any comment until the process has finished its course.\u201dThe latest question is whether the corporate tax rate should go down to 20 percent from 35 percent immediately or in stages.Other challenges \u2022 Remember that Republicans can\u2019t lose more than two senators to pass the tax legislation without Democratic votes.The point here is that the Trump administration is shifting away from the president\u2019s own words. They\u2019re not saying the rich shouldn\u2019t get any tax relief \u2014 they\u2019re saying the rich deserve to get one.Worth readingThe question is whether SoftBank really intends to walk away. We\u2019ve heard that the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s board is unhappy with the prospect of losing control in a merger: At a board meeting last Friday, several directors questioned whether it was wise to take only about 40 percent of the combined wireless business \u2014 a smaller amount than Deutsche Telekom \u2014 because T-Mobile is currently bigger than Sprint.We\u2019ve seen hardball negotiating tactics from SoftBank and Masayoshi Son before: The Japanese conglomerate expressed interest in buying the cable company Charter Communications earlier this year before resuming talks with T-Mobile.Critics\u2019 corner\u2022 Credit Suisse named Steven Geller as its head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, according to an internal memo.

{"Headline": "How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose Situation", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But so what? Hasn\u2019t that always been the case?As the men who run Silicon Valley will be the first to tell you, a company\u2019s size doesn\u2019t matter here. For every lumbering Goliath, there are always one or two smarter, faster Davids just now starting up in some fabled garage, getting ready to slay the giants when they least expect it.Well, maybe not this time.The technology industry is now a playground for giants. Where 10 or 20 years ago we looked to start-ups as a font of future wonders, today the energy and momentum have shifted almost completely to the big guys. In addition to the many platforms they own already, one or more of the Five are on their way to owning artificial intelligence, voice assistants, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, home automation, and every other cool and crazy thing that will rule tomorrow.The best start-ups keep being scooped up by the big guys (see Instagram and WhatsApp, owned by Facebook). Those that escape face merciless, sometimes unfair competition (their innovations copied, their projects litigated against). And even when the start-ups succeed, the Five still win.Because today\u2019s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don\u2019t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition \u2014 they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.The small guys won\u2019t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don\u2019t have the whole game won.They said the Five\u2019s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five\u2019s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren\u2019t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.\u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019d say it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, \u2018Why won\u2019t Microsoft do your business?\u2019 Then six years later it was, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Google do it?\u2019 Now it\u2019s a combination of why can\u2019t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?\u201dMr. Levin\u2019s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller\u2019s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day\u2019s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.IAC\u2019s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie\u2019s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five \u2014 both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that\u2019s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys \u2014 for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms \u2014 because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.\u201cWe think that a smart voice provider will say, \u2018If I want to win at all costs, we\u2019ll go get the very best partner\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s us,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn\u2019t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It\u2019s not betting on their demise; rather, it\u2019s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.IAC\u2019s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. \u201cI think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia \u2014 whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.\u201cI\u2019m mixed as it relates to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers \u2014 and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.\u201dBut like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here\u2019s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Robot Makes a Mean Caesar Salad, but Will It Cost Jobs?", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrototypeSalad bars are magnets for bacteria and viruses. Even if the sprouts and ranch dressing aren\u2019t tainted, the serving utensils may be.Diners use a touch screen to place their orders, choosing from a menu of recipes or designing their own salads. The machine calculates the number of calories per salad and drops the veggies into a bowl in about 45 seconds to two minutes, depending on the size of the salad and the ingredients selected. There is less human contact with the food.But as a growing number of food- and drink-slinging robots have begun interacting with diners in the San Francisco Bay Area, Deepak Sekar, the device\u2019s inventor and the founder and chief executive of Chowbotics, has faced questions about whether his machine will put people out of work. He denies that that will happen.Mr. Sekar insists that his company\u2019s current focus \u2014 which is on the salad bar market instead of restaurants more broadly \u2014 means Sally won\u2019t be a job killer. He says workers at salad bars could restock the robot, which holds enough ingredients for 50 salads before it needs to be refilled. And he says, restaurants can continue with their usual food preparation methods \u2014 relying on kitchen workers to do the chopping or buying precut vegetables.In offices, the gadget could be a source of new jobs, Mr. Sekar says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get fresh food in, and you\u2019re actually creating jobs for people who refill the canisters in these offices,\u201d he said.\u201cWe could be looking at over 50 percent of jobs disappearing in the United States over the next 10 to 15 years,\u201d said Jane Kim, a San Francisco supervisor. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not jobs going abroad, or offshoring of jobs. It\u2019s robots.\u201dSome unions are discussing their own strategies for contending with a robot-clogged future. \u201cIt\u2019s something our union and many unions are still studying,\u201d said Ian Lewis, research director for Unite Here Local 2, a union that represents hotel, food service, restaurant and laundry workers in San Francisco and San Mateo, Calif. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely concerned and trying to grapple with it.\u201dWhatever their effect on employment, new robots are on the way. Mr. Sekar, an inventor with a doctorate in electronics and computer engineering, said he came up with the idea of building a kitchen robot while working as director of engineering for a semiconductor company. Although he loved cooking at home, he said he craved a way of reducing the work involved.Mr. Sekar said his robot has the potential to save money for small businesses that install it in office kitchens alongside appliances like coffee machines. Walking a couple of minutes within a building to a salad-tossing robot instead of venturing outside for lunch would mean shorter work breaks and increased productivity, he said. He calls Sally \u201cthe smallest and most affordable cafeteria an office can have.\u201dThis fall, Chowbotics will begin fulfilling orders for 10 robots, priced at $30,000 each, Mr. Sekar said. He envisions his robots producing healthy meals in convenience stores, airports, hotels, hospitals and universities. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the momentum of Silicon Valley behind it,\u201d Mr. Sekar said.

For instance, he said he has devised a menu for an office robot that can serve salads with South Asian ingredients.Still, Mr. Ayers says other chefs have criticized him. \u201cMany of my colleagues in the industry are like, \u2018What are you doing to us?

Davis.We caught up with Dr. Wintemute, 65, by phone on Monday. Some excerpts:Q. What went through your mind when you saw the news out of Las Vegas?How do we stop it?There isn\u2019t an easy answer. These events are all different and if we devise narrowly crafted policies to prevent the last one, we might not affect the next one.There are some commonalities. One is that weapons designed to kill large numbers of people in a small period of time are more readily available than they should be.Does California have the right mix of gun-control laws?Nobody has it right.But I will say California does have more stringent requirements than most states. Our homicide rates are below average. Our suicide rates are well below average. And beginning about 10 years ago, as rates across the country either stabilized or tended to drift up, California\u2019s have been drifting down.How do you explain that?I suspect it\u2019s a lot of things. Some of them have nothing to do with guns. We have a pretty good health care system. We have a pretty good mental health care system. We have more economic equity than a lot of states have.This is a fundamental point: preventing gun violence just by focusing on guns themselves won\u2019t be sufficient.Do shootings of the kind in Las Vegas take up too much oxygen in the gun debate?I have very mixed opinions. On the one hand, yes, they do take up the oxygen. They account for no more than one maybe two percent of all the deaths from firearm violence in the United States.But the flip side is these events, for good or for ill, give people the sense of a personal stake in the issue. That can have effects in opposite directions. I suspect we will see a spike in gun purchasing after this shooting. But one hopes that people\u2019s increasing sense of personal risk will translate into effective action on the problem.We just have to wait and see.This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)News organizations across California published editorials Monday condemning the violence in Las Vegas.A sampling of the commentary:California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Twitter Plans to Open Ad Data to Users", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Twitter said on Tuesday that it would bring more transparency to advertisements on its site, including political ads, in the latest response by a technology company to criticism about its role in spreading foreign propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign.The company said that under its new rules, users would be able to see who had created an ad, how long an ad had been running and how the ad was targeted toward a specific user.Political ads for a candidate or party would carry a special label to make them stand out. Twitter said it would disclose who had paid for the election advertisement and allow users to find information about the buyer, including ad spending history and ad targeting practices.Twitter said it would put some of these changes in place in the coming weeks, starting in the United States and then expanding globally.Lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration about Twitter. In late September, he said Twitter\u2019s response was \u201cinadequate\u201d when it was asked to provide evidence of Russian-linked advertising and accounts that spread misinformation or were used to favor a presidential candidate.At the time, Twitter said it had discovered about 200 accounts linked to Russian efforts to influence the election. But that figure was significantly less than the number uncovered a month earlier by researchers from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the public policy research group in Washington. The researchers tracked 600 Twitter accounts \u2014 both human and suspected automated \u201cbots\u201d \u2014 that they linked to Russian attempts to influence the election.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said that the company\u2019s announcement did not go far enough and that online companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google needed rules that the government could enforce.Last week, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a bill that would require digital platforms to report who bought political ads on their sites in the same way that TV broadcast stations must maintain databases with those disclosures. The bill was a response to concern that fake accounts linked to Russia on Facebook and other sites were able to fly past monitors on the sites and easily buy thousands of ads promoting racial and other hot-button issues to sow chaos before the election and to influence the result.\u201cI welcome this transparency,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, \u201cbut we need a law in place for two major reasons: Not every company will do this, and you need rules for the road.\u201d She added that the companies should not be left to police themselves.The changes also raise new issues for politicians. For one, advertising agencies often consider their digital strategy part of their \u201csecret sauce\u201d when trying to sell their services to politicians and campaign strategists. Shining a light on the types of ads, the amount spent on them and how often they change could give valuable information to competing candidates.It is also unclear whether Twitter will be able to keep up with campaigns\u2019 ever-changing digital targeting, budgets and goals, and the company did not mention how it plans to tackle large-scale misinformation spread by bots.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said transparency in advertising alone \u201cis not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages.\u201dTwitter said it would try to tighten standards for issues-based ads that wouldn\u2019t fall under its new electioneering rules, such as an environmental group\u2019s push for clean-air policies or an energy company\u2019s promotion of environmental deregulation. But the company admitted that the industry had not agreed on definitions for issues ads.\u201cWe will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policymakers and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above,\u201d Twitter said in its blog post.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "Supported byFirst there were individual offices. Then cubicles and open floor plans. Now, there is a \u201cpalette of places.\u201dNew office designs are coming to a workplace near you, with layouts meant to cater to the variety of tasks required of modern white-collar workers. Put another way, it means people don\u2019t sit in just one place.It\u2019s partly a backlash against the one-size-fits-all mind-set, not to mention the corporate penny-pinching, embodied in the move toward pure open floor plans that packed more workers into less and less space. That idea was supposed to drive collaboration, but many experts agree it often went too far, with row upon row of desks and workbench-style seating more likely to generate ennui than efficiency.\u201cWhen used as a generic answer for work space design, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d said David Lathrop, a researcher at Steelcase, a big office furniture maker.The new model is largely open, but not entirely. Under the revised thinking, breaking down walls to bring people together is good, but so are \u201cteam spaces\u201d and standing tables, comfortable couches and movable walls.Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn\u2019t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include \u201cisolation rooms,\u201d soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.And it\u2019s meant to be tweaked as needs change. \u201cThis continues to be iterated,\u201d said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM \u2014 and whose use of the word \u201citerated\u201d hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.\u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019re going stop and say, \u2018This is it,\u2019\u201d he said.The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work \u2014 or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce\u2019s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.\u201cThese workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,\u201d said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology \u2014 and its hurry-up ways \u2014 into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called \u201cactivity-based workplace design,\u201d tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.\u201cOffice geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,\u201d said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.\u201cYou have to collaborate more,\u201d said Michael Ford, Microsoft\u2019s general manager of global real estate. \u201cWe absolutely have to change.\u201dFor decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to \u201cdo a turtle,\u201d researchers say, and retrench and communicate less \u2014 colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example.Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. \u201cThat\u2019s the sweet spot for Microsoft,\u201d Mr. Ford said.The company thinks it is working. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company\u2019s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft\u2019s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.But companies can also save money, by using a little less space than conventional offices do.Worker space is now about 150 square feet per person, down from 225 square feet in 2010, estimates Tim Venable, senior vice president for research at CoreNet Global, a commercial real estate association. But the hybrid design saves less than entirely open designs, which usually have workbench settings and in which the amount of space can drop to as low as 60 square feet per worker.\u201cThere can be huge value to people coming together, but the real reason a lot of corporations have gone to bench seating is money falling to the bottom line,\u201d said Mr. Lathrop of Steelcase.Another space saver has been getting people to work from home, a trend for years in corporate America. But that trend is reversing, as companies recognize that offices can be creative clusters.IBM, for example, recently called 5,000 of its at-home employees back to offices, though one in five workers in North America still work from home full time, the company said.Since 2014, IBM has spent $380 million renovating its work spaces in the United States, which now bear all the hallmarks of the new hybrid design \u2014 open spaces, whiteboard walls, no offices, sit-or-stand desks, huddle rooms and phone rooms.IBM, said Mr. Cuevas, vice president for real estate strategy and operations, offers employees up to 10 different space configurations. In January, the company also remade its headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., with senior executives departing wood-paneled offices for smaller, side-by-side glass ones without doors.While G.E. executives wait for the company\u2019s new headquarters to be built in Boston, they are working in temporary offices nearby, designed according to the new principles. The contrast with the cavernous offices and silent hallways of the old headquarters in suburban Connecticut could scarcely be more striking \u2014 open spaces, sit-or-stand desks, and no parking spaces. (Workers are urged to take public transportation.)Face-to-face conversations have replaced endless email chains, so decisions are made faster, said Ann Klee, vice president for the Boston development and operations. Still, openness has its limits. Sometimes, she concedes, you do have to ask colleagues to use their \u201cindoor voices.\u201d More quiet rooms are being added to the new headquarters design.The Boston Consulting Group has also adopted the new design, with two goals in mind: prompt people to come to the office rather than avoid it, and encourage more \u201ccasual collisions\u201d that might spur workers to trade ideas and build relationships.Its old Midtown Manhattan office was a traditional space with offices housing one, two or four people each. \u201cLots of doors, lots of pillars, nowhere to really hang out, and people had lunch delivered to their desks,\u201d said Ross Love, a senior partner in New York.The new space, in the Hudson Yards development on the Far West Side of Manhattan, is a hybrid open design. Since the firm moved in last November, most consultants have been coming into the office substantially more often than they did to the old building.Two tests were conducted of about 100 employees, before and after the move. In the new space, workers spent an additional four to five hours a week in short, unplanned interactions. And they spent less time in formal meetings.In surveys, the company\u2019s workers say they are getting more done, faster in the new space. But the payoff, Mr. Love concedes, is difficult to measure so far.\u201cIt\u2019s like increasing the clock speed of a computer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you rev things up, you ought to be able to do more.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Picks Joseph Simons, Corporate Antitrust Lawyer, to Lead F.T.C.", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe consumer protection and competition agency has been led by just two commissioners over the last 10 months. Mr. Trump\u2019s other leading antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, was recently confirmed to lead competition cases at the Justice Department.The timing of the official nominations is unclear. They will be reviewed by Congress but are expected to be approved.Under Mr. Simons, who led the competition bureau of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration, the agency is expected take a free-markets and conservative approach to antitrust issues, maintaining decades-long interpretations of competition laws that put consumer welfare and the efficiencies of markets at the center of enforcement actions and merger reviews.Amazon\u2019s $4.3 billion purchase of Whole Foods was quickly approved by the F.T.C. in August, largely because of ample competition in the grocery foods market.But some antitrust academics and politicians criticized the fast review, saying the government needed to look more broadly at whether Amazon\u2019s ability to take losses and leverage other parts of its businesses harmed competition.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, has called on the agency to reopen an antitrust investigation into Google that was closed in 2013, saying new evidence from a parallel investigation in Europe warrants a new look. Stephen K. Bannon, the former senior adviser to Mr. Trump, has called Google a utility-like monopoly that needs antitrust scrutiny.Mr. Simons comes from the Washington offices of the law firm Paul Weiss, where he served as a partner representing big tech clients including Microsoft and Sony in a $4 billion acquisition of patents from Nortel Networks. He also represented Mastercard in antitrust class-action cases against the credit card company in federal court. But like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for corporate watchdog roles, Mr. Simons has been in and out of the private and public sector for years.Since the election, moderate Democrats and Republicans have trained their focus on corporate consolidation. The new climate, antitrust experts say, makes it difficult to predict how Mr. Simons will act.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting so long for leadership at the agencies, we are out of the speculation business until we see some enforcement under the new antitrust chiefs,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.Jeffrey Chester, head of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, a group that has pushed for online privacy regulations and stronger competition enforcement, said the agency was \u201cat a critical turning point about whether it can be relevant at all protecting consumers in the 21st century.\u201d\u201cIt has been unable to effectively address the dramatic loss of privacy Americans face online,\u201d he added. \u201cThe commission has also failed to effectively tackle the growing power of the major internet companies, especially Google and Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But at its height, AIM, as it was known, served as the social center for teenagers and young adults, the scene of deeply resonant memories and the place where people learned how to interact online.The chat program was a workaround for the typical clumsiness and anxiety of adolescence. Too shy to talk to the boy at his locker? You could go home and chat with him for hours.Scared of inviting the girl to homecoming?

What unexpected stumbling blocks have you come across with it?Unexpected stumbling blocks arise frequently because we\u2019re working on the edges of what we know how to do. There\u2019s often a gap between how we want to tell a story and the tools that we have to do it. That\u2019s when we hack available hardware or software to suit our needs.I don\u2019t know who will make it, but the first immersive media wearable to be widely adopted will look and function more like a pair of reading glasses than like the V.R. headsets we have today. The first generation of modern V.R. and augmented reality headsets are too clunky to go mainstream. They\u2019re heavy and awkward, sometimes connected to a computer by a cable. They\u2019re good prototypes for getting us started in immersive platforms, but I hope someone builds something that\u2019s more convenient for everyday use.I\u2019m ready for a pair of glasses that uses light field technology to integrate interactive digital information in the real world around me.

You look like you work out.Is your polo shirt small, or is it that you have big arms?This is a medium, so I\u2019m hoping it looks a little smaller.Thank you. Express has these. It\u2019s just a cotton blend.Are you into America?Tell me about your outfit.We haven\u2019t been to a Presidents Cup, but we\u2019ve gone to Ryder Cups before so I am used to the Europeans really dressing for the occasion. So I started Googling. What does one Google?I was looking primarily for the shoes, and then I just matched the rest up. I typed in \u201cflag shoes.\u201d They were perfect.And how did you choose your shorts?I started with the shoes, then got the socks. And these are just white normal shorts. Would you wear this when you\u2019re playing golf?I might wear the socks. But you have to wear a collared shirt. What do you think of the uniform Lacoste provided?I think it\u2019s nice. Our flag is yellow and teal. That\u2019s why we\u2019re wearing a lot of teal and matching it up with yellow jumpers to have that distinct look. What do you normally play in?I wear Cherv\u00f2, which is an Italian company, so very much Italian style: shorter sleeves and a lot of really high-tech materials.Tell me about your shoesShoes are something that\u2019s very much a part of our gear, it\u2019s almost like our equipment. I wear FootJoys. The DryJoys. I wear orthotics so I need a shoe with a little more supportWhat do you think of the course? There\u2019s all this wind.It a tough day to be out there, but it\u2019s the same for everyone. So it\u2019s going to be a mental battle as much as a physical one.You went with shorts.It\u2019s going to be hot. We\u2019re approaching 80 degrees. These are Reiss.Is there a rule with golf and how long the shorts need to be?I honestly wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a golfer.The polo shirt \u2014 is that an everyday thing for you?And you\u2019re doing the sweater around your neck. That was a mistake. It was cold this morning. Tell me about your wrist wear.The watch is IWC Schaffhausen. And the beaded bracelet I got on the subway. Ten bucks.Why did you go with those shoes?Because the grass is very soft and the shoes have a tread on them.Are they Gucci?Where did you get your blazer?I think it\u2019s Korean.What\u2019s on your hat?It\u2019s Ultra China. It\u2019s an electronic musical festival.Are you an EDM fan?Yes!Is this what you wear to play golf?No, not really. Real men wear pink.Yes. I also have two daughters. I end up wearing a lot of pink.Basic khakis \u2014 the uniform today.I don\u2019t know where these are from. I should mention that I\u2019m dressed by my wife. She gets all credit.They just appear in your closet.She gives me clothes. I try them on. If they fit, I give a thumbs up. The cigar. Is it a golf thing or an everyday thing?Golf thing. Very manly.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a participant in the Presidents Cup. He is Mike Weir, not Bob. The article also misstated his role in the tournament. He was a captain's assistant, not a player.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Invented \u2018Zero\u2019?", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionObviously, there were no intellectual property rights in force back then. Had there been a patent office, it might have ruled, as courts do now, that mathematical advances uncover pre-existing knowledge rather than create anything new \u2014 and are hence unpatentable. The conundrum of whether mathematics is discovered or invented is as old as Plato. Certainly, zero displays this duality: The void is as old as time, but it was a human innovation to harness it with a symbol.In recognition of this innovation, and ignoring all practicalities, suppose someone, somehow, had figured out how to put a price tag on zero. The royalties generated would be staggering \u2014 imagine the tab for just your personal use alone! This might lead to a significant redistribution of wealth, most of it going to the developing world.Babylon ended up with 18 percent, which if allotted to Iraq, the present-day country of its location, might be just compensation for the years of war endured. Greece came next, with a surprising 15 percent \u2014 perhaps my class felt the country was getting shortchanged for all its other mathematical contributions. The Mayans raked in 14 percent, which means Mexico would be rolling in so much money from its share that it might be the one clamoring (and paying) for a wall. My class\u2019s most left-leaning group declared it wouldn\u2019t disburse the money at all, \u201cso as not to encourage capitalism.\u201dOf course, the exercise was pure fantasy for many reasons; any compensatory scheme would be dead on arrival based on the mention of \u201creparations.\u201d And yet it highlighted the fact that there were cultures and peoples that parented zero, whose descendants may not be doing as well now. If not financial recompense, is at least some enhanced ethical responsibility toward them owed?If so, the primary onus might fall on tech companies, arguably the biggest users of this resource. Right now, their prize target is India, with Microsoft, Google and Facebook all vying to bring its enormous population online. These giants might point out that they\u2019re already being altruistic by offering free connectivity, through schemes that will plug in rural areas, vitalize the economy and transform the country \u2014 and just happen to add hundreds of millions of potential customers to their rosters for a variety of ads and e-products. Could it be a coincidence that Microsoft, for instance, has also been investing heavily in future cloud services, cybersecurity and e-commerce for India?Think of it. The companies will use the indigenously developed resource of zeros and ones (the Arabs got their numerals from India, after all), package them into new services and products, and sell them back. India has lived through such irony before. The British Empire took her raw cotton and sold it back as finished garments, destroying the local textile industry and helping lower India\u2019s share of the world gross domestic product to 3 percent from 23 percent.Fortunately, the parallel flounders. The finished e-products will mostly be manufactured in India, even if backed by foreign investment. Also, the country is wiser: It will not succumb easily to a new cyber-colonialism. Last year, under a broader \u201cnet neutrality\u201d decision, the government banned Facebook\u2019s \u201cFree Basics\u201d plan, which offered free Wi-Fi but only to websites of the company\u2019s choosing (Facebook, undeterred, is already marketing a replacement). This year, it also declined a bid from Microsoft to offer connectivity through old television bands. Instead, under pressure from Indian cellular operators, the bands will be auctioned off.Whether Indian tech companies will prevail remains to be seen. What\u2019s clear is that vigorous market competition is underway to control all those zeros and ones. Despite my liberal student group\u2019s disapproval, zero encourages capitalistic forces, after all.In fact, zero is essential to much of human endeavor; it has become a fundamental part of our legacy, too seemingly immutable for any kind of compensatory reckoning. And yet the Bakhshali manuscript reminds us that zero wasn\u2019t always at hand. Rather, it was the intellectual product of cultures perhaps far different from our own, of peoples and regions that may have subsided but could once again rise to dominance.Advertisement"}

Or at least watch live. Ratings for the series didn\u2019t improve much after its first season, even when the show\u2019s quality did.Instead of reverse engineering another \u201cMad Men\u201d or \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d for AMC \u2014 something early reviews accused its showrunners of doing \u2014 creators Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers (\u201cthe Chrises\u201d) scrapped some of their conceptions of what \u201cHalt\u201d was about and found their own voice. Later seasons focused on the dynamic energy of people trying to innovate together in the dawn of the modern tech world, and the makeshift family that would result.After four seasons, the series ended Saturday night. In advance of that, the showrunners got on the phone to talk to us about the road to the series finale. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Of all the ideas that you pitched in the beginning, which ones survived to the very end? Did you feel that people were expecting \u201cHalt\u201d to be \u201cMad Men\u201d with computers? It seemed to be a comparison that was imposed upon you. Chris and I came up in an age where those male antihero shows were very good, very celebrated. That was a storytelling structure that was worthy of being investigated. I think the best shows crack that wide open and mine them for all they\u2019re worth. But we entered with kind of a Trojan horse. We were looking to challenge that idea. It took us a bit to crack open Joe and figure out who he was. And to be honest, we were doing some of that even as we were a few episodes into the first season. I think we did find a fascinating, difficult, duplicitous, and yet very human guy who is all his own and not a carbon copy.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.Joe is perhaps the character that changed most.It really felt as if, with the daylong phone call episode this season, Cameron and Joe were going to end up together. Why unravel them? I don\u2019t think we ultimately knew the fate of that relationship until late in the process, and the asteroid that really hit was Gordon\u2019s death. That really shook the characters to their very core. Joe\u2019s desire to have children, and Cameron\u2019s realization that she absolutely does not want to have them, is kind of a dividing line. But also, what we\u2019ve been trying to say in this series, and exemplify with the characters\u2019 lives, is that nothing lasts forever. And I think to give Joe and Cameron a good time, and to have it work for a while, felt honest and true. That seems to be how life works a lot, especially for these five.A lot of people were worried you would flip it around and make Cameron get accidentally pregnant. Many of this year\u2019s best TV shows and movies are available to stream right now. Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site, can show you where. Tell us what mood you\u2019re in or what services you subscribe to and we\u2019ll help you out.We have the same problem this season that we had in Season 1, when the Macintosh computer beat their Giant. Here, Yahoo beats Comet by getting on the Netscape menu bar. Every tech battle they have is going to be a rigged fight, even if they have the better idea.If the story were just about whether or not they built the machine, or ended up being the company that IPOs, it would be over. To a certain extent, the iterative process of technology, the way it ramps up and reaches some type of conclusion, that\u2019s what we wanted to do in the character stories. We wanted to depict them on this cycle, with the idea: \u201cThe next project is the one that\u2019s going to make me whole. This next relationship is the one that\u2019s going to go on forever.\u201d But that\u2019s not really how it works.This season, more than any other \u2014 the Yahoo of it all, the fact that Comet didn\u2019t go to be the search box on your browser \u2014 almost felt beside the point. After they lost Gordon, Joe and Cameron were kind of losing each other, and we wanted to see the stakes devolve back into the personal. They get little wins instead.AOL just announced that they were retiring Instant Messenger, and that felt like a \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d kind of moment.Advertisement"}

France and Britain have set a date. California is edging that way, too.And the world\u2019s car companies are scrambling to prepare.But it is still unclear when the industry will be fully electric.\u201cThey wisely gave no time frame because, frankly, no one knows how the future will evolve,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the research firm Autotrader.\u201cIt\u2019s not a niche anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very broad-based. Many of these solutions have now reached the famous inflection point where the adoption starts to accelerate.\u201dAlphabet\u2019s self-driving unit, Waymo, has been fighting in courts for months to get access to a due diligence report that Uber commissioned before it bought Ottomotto, the autonomous truck start-up founded by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski.That report, compiled by the cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg, was made public on Monday. Waymo is using it to show that Uber was aware of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s attempts to retain and gain access to information taken from Google. It details a history of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s meeting with Uber executives while still employed at Google.According to the document, Stroz found 50,000 work emails from his time at Google on Levandowski\u2019s personal computer. Stroz also found texts between Levandowski and former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick about recruitment efforts and working with Uber\u2019s self-driving arm dating back to as early as February and March 2016 \u2014 just weeks after Levandowski left Alphabet and launched Otto out of stealth.After leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski said he found a data storage container in his house containing \u201csource code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars,\u201d according to the report, information that Mr. Levandowski said he downloaded as a matter of \u201chis departure from ordinary course of business.\u201dInvestigators also found evidence of photos of Google self-driving car designs, whiteboard sketches and pictures of hardware and electronic components stored on Mr. Levandowski\u2019s iPhone.Jo Bertram, the regional manager for Uber in Northern Europe, has announced her departure just as the new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is in London to meet with the city\u2019s transportation authorities over their decision not to renew Uber\u2019s license.Given some of our current challenges, I\u2019m also convinced that now is the right time to have a change of face, and to hand over to someone who will be here for the long haul and take us into the next phase. While I would like to have announced my move in smoother circumstances, I\u2019m proud of the team we\u2019ve built here and am very confident in their abilities to lead the business into the next chapter.Ms. Bertram, who will continue for a few weeks to help with the transition, has been a key contact between Uber and Transport for London.She has been involved in negotiating on a range of regulatory questions, from streamlining the licensing process to securing permission for new Uber services in London.Her directorship was terminated on August 30, according to a Companies House filing, a few weeks before TfL officially notified Uber about its license, although Uber told the press at the time that this was related to an earlier role change.The debate is heating up as Procter & Gamble edges toward one of the largest proxy votes in history, on Oct. 10.Mr. Taylor made another plea to shareholders this week via a video, asking them not to vote for Mr. Peltz.Nelson Peltz would seek to fundamentally change the soul of our company. He wants us to go to a holding company in 3 separate businesses. He said corporate R&D is a hobby. It\u2019s not a hobby. It\u2019s fundamental to our brands and the processes that make our brands.To get an idea of what the P&G trio might be grilled on, here are some of the questions drawn up by Bernstein:\u2022 On the one hand PG has said that Peltz\u2019s new structure would be too costly; on the other hand PG has said Peltz is trying to fire loads of people, especially in Cincinnati. Which is it? What, specifically, is so wrong with Peltz\u2019s org plan if many other companies are run this way too and have done better than PG over the past decade?\u2022 Didn\u2019t Meg Whitman benefit from activist Ralph Whitworth on her board at HP? Why is this different?Goldman Sachs is considering betting on Bitcoin, soon after JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon called it a fraud.Goldman, which is considering a new trading operation dedicated to digital currencies, would be the first blue-chip Wall Street firm to deal directly in this market, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. Although banks have looked at using blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, they have been wary of wading directly into the market.Goldman\u2019s effort involves both its currency-trading division and the bank\u2019s strategic investment group, the people said. That suggests the firm believes bitcoin\u2019s future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold.Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood executive and co-founder of DreamWorks Animation, is trying to raise money for a television start-up and he\u2019s doing it on a scale that dwarfs the kind of money raised by the likes of Facebook, Netflix and Uber.Virtually every large media and technology company, as well as several private equity firms, have shown some interest.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s idea? Premium quality content in short form, like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with a narrative arc of 10 minutes.\u201cI would actually make the argument that one of the challenges for network TV has been that they\u2019ve actually busted the form by asking people to watch 19 minutes of commercial time inside of 60 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-two percent of your watch time is watching commercials.\u201d\u201cThis idea that Apple and Facebook and YouTube are now coming into Hollywood with these billions of dollars and are in fact going to change the enterprise of television is actually wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything new or different or unique.\u201dThe ad agency is preparing to lock horns with Bain Capital after the private equity firm launched a $1.3 billion tender offer for Asatsu-DK, Japan\u2019s third-biggest advertising agency and a long-term business partner of WPP.Just hours after Bain\u2019s offer was made public, people close to WPP said on Monday night that it did not intend to sell its 24.7 per cent stake in Asatsu-DK (ADK) at the \u00a53,660 price offered by Bain, as the tender \u201cseverely undervalues\u201d the Japanese firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Russia Harvested American Rage to Reshape U.S. Politics", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of these were recorded, posted or written by Americans. Yet all ended up becoming grist for a network of Facebook pages linked to a shadowy Russian company that has carried out propaganda campaigns for the Kremlin, and which is now believed to be at the center of a far-reaching Russian program to influence the 2016 presidential election.A New York Times examination of hundreds of those posts shows that one of the most powerful weapons that Russian agents used to reshape American politics was the anger, passion and misinformation that real Americans were broadcasting across social media platforms.Other posts on the Russian pages used stilted language or phrases rarely found in American English. Yet their use of borrowed ideas and arguments from Americans, which were already resonating among conservatives and liberals, demonstrated a deft understanding of the political terrain. The Russians also paid Facebook to promote their posts in the feeds of American Facebook users, helping them test what content would circulate most widely, and among which audiences.One Russian Facebook page, the United Muslims of America, frequently posted content highlighting discrimination against Muslims. In June 2016, it posted a video originally made by Waqas Shah, 23, an online video creator from Staten Island. In the video, Mr. Shah dressed in a thobe, a traditional ankle-length gown worn by Arab men, walked through New York\u2019s Union Square, where he is shoved and harassed by another actor pretending to be a bully to see how bystanders react.The video ends with Mr. Shah pointing out New York\u2019s hypocrisy: The city claims to be a \u201cmelting pot,\u201d but no one intervened while he was getting harassed. Mr. Shah\u2019s original video, posted on YouTube in June 2016, was a viral hit that attracted more than three million views. A week after he posted it, United Muslims of America copied the video to its group page without the original YouTube link, a process known as ripping. There, Mr. Shah\u2019s video become the Russian page\u2019s most popular post, earning more than 150,000 interactions.Mr. Shah said when he noticed the ripped video, he wrote to the administrator of the United Muslims account, asking them to add the link to his original YouTube video. His main concern, Mr. Shah said, was that the page was stealing his views. Told that his video had been used by Russian accounts to sow division in the United States, Mr. Shah said there wasn\u2019t anything he could do about it.\u201cThere are always going to be people who manipulate things to their agenda,\u201d he said.When Being Patriotic posted a brief message last year rallying Americans against proposals to expand refugee settlements in the United States, it was liked, shared or otherwise engaged with by more than 750,000 Facebook users. Eventually, it came across the feed of Len Swanson, 64, a Republican activist from Houston and an avid Trump supporter.\u201cI usually publish an article several times a week, to keep driving the narrative,\u201d Mr. Swanson said in an interview. He was not bothered, he said, by becoming an unwitting cog in the Russian propaganda machine. \u201cYou know we do the same damn thing over there,\u201d Mr. Swanson said. \u201cWhat do you think \u2014 we\u2019re saints?\u201dAs lawmakers debate tighter regulation for companies like Facebook, the trail of Russian digital bread crumbs underscores how difficult it will be to purge social media networks of foreign influence, or even to hamper the covert propaganda campaigns carried out on social platforms by Russia, China and other countries.Copying other people\u2019s content without proper attribution can be a violation of the social networks\u2019 rules. But the content itself \u2014 the videos, posts and Instagram memes borrowed and shared on the Russian pages \u2014 are not explicitly violent or discriminatory, so they do not violate the rules of those services. Instead, they are precisely the type of engaging content these platforms are hungry for.The Russian campaign also appears to have been tailored to exploit the companies\u2019 own strategies for keeping users engaged. Facebook, for example, pushed people to interact more in Groups like the ones set up by the Russians, where users can \u201cshare their common interests and express their opinion\u201d around a common cause. LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by Microsoft, is geared toward encouraging users like Mr. Swanson to create articles and other content.\u201cThe strategies are no mystery,\u201d said Michael Strangelove, a lecturer on internet culture at the University of Ottawa. \u201cForeign powers are playing within the rules of the game that we wrote.\u201dA spokesman for Facebook declined to comment. LinkedIn said Mr. Swanson\u2019s post did not violate the site\u2019s terms of service.\u201cThe challenges posed by the dissemination of fake news and other harmful content through technology platforms are serious,\u201d said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. \u201cWe actively address suspected violations of LinkedIn\u2019s terms of service such as harassment, fake profiles, and misinformation on our platform.\u201dThe Russians appear to have insinuated themselves across American social media platforms and used the same promotional tools that people employ to share cat videos, airline complaints and personal rants. Many of the posts on Being Patriotic also match pre-made, shareable graphics on sites like ConservativeMemes.com, nestled alongside other conservative content made for sharing on social media.Boosted by Russian accounts, the material was quickly picked up by other American users of Facebook, spreading the posts to an even bigger audience. The Russian presence appeared to be layered throughout different platforms: Some of the Facebook accounts, including Being Patriotic, had linked accounts on Instagram and Twitter, according to deleted content captured in Google\u2019s cache.John W. Kelly, the founder of Graphika, a commercial analytics company in New York, said the Russians appeared to have a consistent strategy across different platforms. Graphika has tracked thousands of social media accounts whose content closely tracks Russian information operations, promoting articles and videos about WikiLeaks dumps of stolen emails and \u201cfalse flag\u201d conspiracies about Syrian chemical weapons.The Russian accounts intermingle with real groups of Facebook or Twitter users \u2014 from white nationalists to Bernie Sanders supporters \u2014 and seek to manipulate and radicalize them, Mr. Kelly said.Rather than construct fake grass-roots support behind their ideas \u2014 the public relations strategy known as \u201cAstroturfing\u201d \u2014 the Russians sought to cultivate and influence real political movements, Mr. Kelly said.\u201cIt isn\u2019t Astroturfing \u2014 they\u2019re throwing seeds and fertilizer onto social media,\u201d said Mr. Kelly. \u201cYou want to grow it, and infiltrate it so you can shape it a little bit.\u201dNick Confessore reported from New York and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "How the Appetite for Emojis Complicates the Effort to Standardize the World\u2019s Alphabets", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "FeatureDo the volunteers behind Unicode, whose mission is to bring all human languages into the digital sphere, have enough bandwidth to deal with emojis too?Supported byPandey eventually identified the script as an alphabet for Rohingya, the language spoken by the stateless and persecuted Muslim people whose greatest numbers live in western Myanmar, where they\u2019ve been the victims of brutal ethnic cleansing. Pandey wasn\u2019t sure if the alphabet itself was in use anymore, until he lucked upon contemporary pictures of printed textbooks for children. That meant it wasn\u2019t a historical footnote; it was alive.An email query from Pandey bounced from expert to expert until it landed with Muhammad Noor, a Rohingya activist and television host who was living in Malaysia. He told Pandey the short history of this alphabet, which was developed in the 1980s by a group of scholars that included a man named Mohammed Hanif. It spread slowly through the 1990s in handwritten, photocopied books. After 2001, thanks to two computer fonts designed by Noor, it became possible to type the script in word-processing programs. But no email, text messages or (later) tweets could be sent or received in it, no Google searches conducted in it. The Rohingya had no digital alphabet of their own through which they could connect with one another.Billions of people around the world no longer face this plight. Whether on computers or smartphones, they can write as they write, expressing themselves in their own linguistic culture. What makes this possible is a 26-year-old international industrial standard for text data called the Unicode standard, which prescribes the digital letters, numbers and punctuation marks of more than 100 different writing systems: Greek, Cherokee, Arabic, Latin, Devanagari \u2014 a world-spanning storehouse of languages. But the alphabet that Noor described wasn\u2019t among them, and neither are more than 100 other scripts, just over half of them historical and the rest alphabets that could still be used by as many as 400 million people today.Now a computational linguist and motivated by a desire to put his historical knowledge to use, Pandey knows how to get obscure alphabets into the Unicode standard. Since 2005, he has done so for 19 writing systems (and he\u2019s currently working to add another eight). With Noor\u2019s help, and some financial support from a research center at the University of California, Berkeley, he drew up the basic set of letters and defined how they combine, what rules govern punctuation and whether spaces exist between words, then submitted a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the organization that maintains the standards for digital scripts. In 2018, seven years after Pandey\u2019s discovery, what came to be called Hanifi Rohingya will be rolled out in Unicode\u2019s 11th version. The Rohingya will be able to communicate online with one another, using their own alphabet.As a practical matter, this will not have much impact for the Rohingya who are suffering in Myanmar, many of whom are illiterate and shut off from educational and technological opportunity. \u201cThe spread of this new digital system is unlikely to go to scale,\u201d Maung Zarni, a human rights activist who works on Rohingya issues, and Natalie Brinham, a Ph.D. fellow at Queen Mary University of London, told me in an email. They emphasized that the Rohingya do not have the autonomy to organize their own schools. But given the group\u2019s history of oppression, the encoding of their language carries considerable symbolic weight because it legitimizes an oppressed minority and their language. \u201cIt becomes a tool of unity to help people come together,\u201d Noor says.Creating such interconnectedness and expanding the linguistic powers of technology users around the world is the whole point of Unicode. If the work is slow, that\u2019s because standardizing a writing system for computers is a delicate art that relies on both engineering and diplomacy. And the time and attention of the volunteers who maintain the standard are finite. So what happens when a new system of visual communication like emoji emerges and comes under their purview? Things get even slower and the mission more complicated.At the time, computing in the United States relied on encodings like those from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (usually known as ASCII), which assigned numerical identifiers to letters, numbers, punctuation and behaviors (like \u201cindent\u201d). The capital letter \u201cA,\u201d for instance, had an ASCII code of 065, or 01000001 in the 0s and 1s in the binary code of computers. Each textual character used by a computer needs its own unique sequence, a numerical identifier or \u201ccharacter encoding.\u201d The problem with ASCII was that it had only 256 codes to distribute and far more than 256 characters in the world needing identifiers.In order to work with more writing systems than ASCII was able to handle, technology companies like Apple, Xerox, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and even Kodak created their proprietary encodings. None of them worked with the others. To complicate things further, some nations insisted as a matter of national pride on their own standards for text data. \u201cThe proliferation of character encodings was chaos,\u201d Whistler says.Joe Becker gathered like-minded computer scientists to bring order to the chaos, arguing that cooperation was needed among companies. The result was the Unicode Consortium, which was incorporated in 1991. He also maintained that the solution had to be international and helped broker an alliance with the International Organization for Standardization, which maintains more than 20,000 standards related to products and services, from the tensile strength of yarn to the chemical composition of toys. Such standards are meant to ensure, among other things, that things from one country can be used in the industrial processes of another. Standardized shipping containers, for instance, have made international commerce far more efficient. Standards don\u2019t become regulations; they\u2019re conventions, \u201crecipes for reality\u201d in the words of Lawrence Busch, a sociologist emeritus at Michigan State University who studies how standards arise. Unicode unified all the numerical identifiers and made sure they were reliable and up-to-date.As is the case in other standards organizations, full membership in the nonprofit Unicode Consortium comes with the right to vote on changes to the standard. Membership dues are $18,000 annually; current full members include global tech giants (like Apple, Facebook and Google) and the Sultanate of Oman (which wants to see digital Arabic improved). A second membership tier includes a university, government bodies in Bangladesh and India, a typeface company and an emoji search engine. Over the years, members came and went, depending on their immediate interest in issues of standardization.Unicode\u2019s idealistic founders intended to bring the personal-computing revolution to everyone on the planet, regardless of language. \u201cThe people who really got the bug,\u201d Whistler says, \u201csaw themselves at an inflection point in history and their chance to make a difference.\u201d No fortunes have been made through Unicode, unless you count the platforms (like Twitter) and products (like the iPhone) that adopted the standard.Unicode\u2019s history is full of attacks by governments, activists and eccentrics. In the early 1990s, the Chinese government objected to the encoding of Tibetan. About five years ago, Hungarian nationalists tried to sabotage the encoding for Old Hungarian because they wanted it to be called \u201cSzekley-Hungarian Rovas\u201d instead. An encoding for an alphabet used to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit was delayed a few years ago by ethnonationalists who mistrusted the proposal because they objected to the author\u2019s surname. Over and over, the Unicode Consortium has protected its standard from such political attacks.The standard\u2019s effectiveness helped. \u201cIf standards work, they\u2019re invisible and can be ignored by the public,\u201d Busch says. Twenty years after its first version, Unicode had become the default text-data standard, adopted by device manufacturers and software companies all over the world. Each version of the standard ushered more users into a seamless digital world of text. \u201cWe used to ask ourselves, \u2018How many years do you think the consortium will need to be in place before we can publish the last version?\u2019\u2009\u201d Whistler recalls. The end was finally in sight \u2014 at one point the consortium had barely more than 50 writing systems to add.All that changed in October 2010, when that year\u2019s version of the Unicode standard included its first set of emojis.In the late 1990s, when Japanese phone manufacturers first put emojis on their devices as marketing gimmicks, messaging standards required that emojis be sent as text data \u2014 as characters matched to strings of numbers, not as images. But emojis were unreadable on devices that couldn\u2019t translate their numerical identifiers.When a software engineer named Graham Asher suggested in 2000 that Unicode take responsibility for emojis, the consortium demurred on the grounds that pictures were subjectively interpreted. A few years later, companies like Apple and Microsoft realized that the increasingly popular Japanese emojis would appear as gibberish on their products and pushed the consortium to encode them. By 2009, 974 emojis had been assigned numerical identifiers, which were released the following year.As the demand for new emojis surged, so, too, did the criticisms. White human figures didn\u2019t reflect the diversity of real skin colors. Many emojis for specific professions (like police officer and construction worker) had only male figures, while icons for foods didn\u2019t represent what people around the world actually ate. Millions of users wanted to communicate using the language of emoji, and as consumers, they expected change to be swift. One thing appeared to be slowing things down: the Unicode Consortium.At Emojicon, resentment toward Unicode was simmering amid the emoji karaoke, emoji improv and talks on emoji linguistics. \u201cSuch a 1980s sci-fi villain name,\u201d one participant grumbled. \u201cWho put them in charge?\u201d A student from Rice University, Mark Bramhill, complained that the requirements for the yoga-pose emoji he had proposed were off-puttingly specific, almost as if they were meant to deter him. A general antiestablishment frustration seemed to be directed at the ruling organization. One speaker, Latoya Peterson, the deputy editor of digital innovation for ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Undefeated,\u201d urged people to submit proposals to Unicode for more diverse emojis. \u201cWe are the internet!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is us!\u201dOn the first morning of Emojicon, Mark Davis, president of Unicode, explained in a talk that the consortium also maintains the repository for time and date formats, currency and language names and other information that adapts computer functions to where a user is. Even more demanding technically is making sure that characters behave as users want them to. One major achievement has been ironing out how right-to-left alphabets like Arabic are used in the same line of text as left-to-right ones like Latin, which affects billions of users and can take years to adjust. Dealing with emojis, in short, is a small, though increasing, part of the consortium\u2019s responsibilities.Davis mentioned that once characters become part of the Unicode standard, they\u2019re never removed. This inspired one young designer in the audience to announce that he\u2019d ensure his legacy by proposing emojis until one was accepted. The crowd laughed; Davis smiled coolly, perhaps because Unicode committees have been overwhelmed with some 500 submissions in the last three years.Not everyone thinks that Unicode should be in the emoji business at all. I met several people at Emojicon promoting apps that treat emojis like pictures, not text, and I heard an idea floated for a separate standards body for emojis run by people with nontechnical backgrounds. \u201cNormal people can have an opinion about why there isn\u2019t a cupcake emoji,\u201d said Jennifer 8. Lee, an entrepreneur and a film producer whose advocacy on behalf of a dumpling emoji inspired her to organize Emojicon. The issue isn\u2019t space \u2014 Unicode has about 800,000 unused numerical identifiers \u2014 but about whose expertise and worldview shapes the standard and prioritizes its projects.\u201cEmoji has had a tendency to subtract attention from the other important things the consortium needs to be working on,\u201d Ken Whistler says. He believes that Unicode was right to take responsibility for emoji, because it has the technical expertise to deal with character chaos (and has dealt with it before). But emoji is an unwanted distraction. \u201cWe can spend hours arguing for an emoji for chopsticks, and then have nobody in the room pay any attention to details for what\u2019s required for Nepal, which the people in Nepal use to write their language. That\u2019s my main concern: emoji eats the attention span both in the committee and for key people with other responsibilities.\u201dEmoji has nonetheless provided a boost to Unicode. Companies frequently used to implement partial versions of the standard, but the spread of emoji now forces them to adopt more complete versions of it. As a result, smartphones that can manage emoji will be more likely to have Hanifi Rohingya on them too. The stream of proposals also makes the standard seem alive, attracting new volunteers to Unicode\u2019s mission. It\u2019s not unusual for people who come to the organization through an interest in emoji to end up embracing its priorities. \u201cWorking on characters used in a small province of China, even if it\u2019s 20,000 people who are going to use it, that\u2019s a more important use of their time than deliberating over whether the hand of my yoga emoji is in the right position,\u201d Mark Bramhill told me.Since its creation was announced in 2015, the \u201cAdopt a Character\u201d program, through which individuals and organizations can sponsor any characters, including emojis, has raised more than $200,000. A percentage of the proceeds goes to support the Script Encoding Initiative, a research project based at Berkeley, which is headed by the linguistics researcher Deborah Anderson, who is devoted to making Unicode truly universal. One the consortium recently accepted is called Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, devised for the Hmong language by a minister in California whose parishioners have been using it for more than 25 years. Still in the proposal stage is Tigalari, once used to write Sanskrit and other Indian languages.One way to read the story of Unicode in the time of emoji is to see a privileged generation of tech consumers confronting the fact that they can\u2019t communicate in ways they want to on their devices: through emoji. They get involved in standards-making, which yields them some satisfaction but slows down the speed with which millions of others around the world get access to the most basic of online linguistic powers. \u201cThere are always winners and losers in standards,\u201d Lawrence Busch says. \u201cYou might want to say, ultimately we\u2019d like everyone to win and nobody to lose too much, but we\u2019re stuck with the fact that we have to make decisions, and when we make them, those decisions are going to be less acceptable to some than to others.\u201dMichael Erard is writer in residence at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics and the author of \u2018\u2018Babel No More: The Search for the World\u2019s Most Extraordinary Language Learners.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

But many reading this article online are probably familiar with an easy workaround: Plug a search term or headline into Google, and voil\u00e0! Free access to articles normally locked behind pay walls.That digital sleight of hand is great for inquisitive readers, but bad for the publishers that are increasingly dependent on subscription dollars for survival.So now, in an acknowledgment of this industrywide strategy shift, Google is working on new tools that could help news organizations bolster their subscription businesses. The tools are part of a broader effort to preserve the kind of journalism that Google\u2019s dominance, and that of other web giants like Facebook, has threatened.Google\u2019s plans include doing away with the \u201cfirst click free\u201d policy, which requires subscription-based news outlets to offer three free articles a day through its search and news features, allowing users to skirt pay walls. A new program, which Google plans to start this week and is calling \u201cflexible sampling,\u201d will allow those publishers to determine how many free clicks to give Google\u2019s users.Google is also looking at ways to help people subscribe to publications more easily, including using machine learning to help publishers tailor options to a reader\u2019s preferences and behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s really all an attempt to try to create a new world \u2014 a better world \u2014 for journalism,\u201d said Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer.

The company said it was helping publishers embrace a try-before-you-buy approach that it hoped would induce readers to become subscribers. It also said it would index all of a publisher\u2019s articles, regardless of the limit the publisher chooses.Google is recommending that publishers provide 10 free articles on a monthly, rather than a daily, basis.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned over the years as the market has matured is that the one-size-fits-all approach to \u2018first click free\u2019 really doesn\u2019t make sense in this market,\u201d said Richard Gingras, Google\u2019s vice president of news. \u201cWe\u2019re basically saying to the publishers, \u2018You decide how much you want to sample.\u2019\u201dGoogle is also working on tools for publishers to help drive subscriptions. One of the company\u2019s goals, Mr. Gingras said, is to help \u201ctake the friction out of the purchase process\u201d by using its own technological capabilities, as well as the information it has on users \u2014 including email address and credit cards \u2014 to make subscribing simpler. Mr. Gingras said Google expected to begin rolling out its suite of subscription support services in the first half of next year.\u201cWe\u2019re not suggesting this is a magic bullet for growing subscription revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to collaborate \u2014 this is a journey.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter announced on Thursday that it would ban RT and Sputnik, the two Kremlin-backed international news outlets, from advertising on its platform, intensifying the battle over Russian propaganda on social media and prompting an immediate threat of retaliation from the Russian Foreign Ministry.The decision marks one of the most aggressive moves by an American social media company against the outlets, which United States intelligence officials have linked to a wide-ranging Kremlin effort, both covert and overt, to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Twitter\u2019s ban comes as United States authorities are pressuring RT, formerly known as Russia Today, to register as a foreign agent under a World War II-era law intended to curtail Nazi propaganda.Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, is now at the center of congressional investigations into the Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human \u201ctrolls\u201d and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government. But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively.But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitter\u2019s lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising. Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign.Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities\u2019 use of the platform to influence American politics praised the company\u2019s decision on Thursday \u2014 but cautioned that it would not be enough.\u201cI appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitter\u2019s most vocal critics on Capitol Hill. \u201cWhat I hope is we\u2019ll see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.\u201d\u201cTwitter\u2019s announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets \u2014 RT and Sputnik \u2014 from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute\u201d for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement.On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011. The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitter\u2019s decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform. Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human \u201ctrolls\u201d on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news.\u201cI think it\u2019s only a drop in the bucket,\u201d said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cWhat\u2019s far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputnik\u2019s ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesn\u2019t need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.\u201dMoreover, Twitter\u2019s decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter \u2014 and rival social media companies \u2014 treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms. Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda. China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV.\u201cThis is not about being a state-sponsored news organization,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Intelligence Heads Warn That Russian Election Meddling Continues", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee delivered a stark warning on Wednesday to political candidates: Expect Russian operatives to remain active and determined to again try to sow chaos in elections next month and next year.\u201cThe Russian intelligence service is determined \u2014 clever \u2014 and I recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously,\u201d Mr. Burr said.\u201cYou can\u2019t walk away from this and believe that Russia\u2019s not currently active,\u201d he added.American intelligence agencies have concluded that Mr. Putin initially wanted to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, but later tried to explicitly help Donald J. Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign. The senators said they have reached no conclusion on whether anyone around Mr. Trump was part of that effort.\u201cThe issue of collusion is still open,\u201d Mr. Burr said.The news conference was the most extensive since the committee began its investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election early this year and the first time the senators have detailed so fully the trajectory of their secretive investigation and their sense of the stakes. Both men come from swing states where the presidential campaign was fought aggressively.That appeared to have made an impression.\u201cThere needs to be a more aggressive whole-of-government approach in terms of protecting our electoral system,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cRemember, to make a change even in a national election doesn\u2019t require penetration into 50 states.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou could pick two or three states in two or three jurisdictions and alter an election.\u201dThe Senate Intelligence Committee is one of three committees on Capitol Hill that have opened full-fledged investigations into the relationship between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. Given the committee\u2019s jurisdiction over the intelligence community and a strong working relationship between Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner, it has been considered the congressional committee most likely to deliver a substantive report on Russia\u2019s covert efforts.Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner sought to inspire confidence on Wednesday that the committee remained on course to do so. They later got a boost from Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he concurred with their statements based on his committee\u2019s work.\u201cThis feels like it\u2019s taking a long time. It is taking a long time,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cBut getting it right and getting all the facts is what we owe the American people.\u201dIn each case, Mr. Burr said the committee had interviewed all of the relevant witnesses and found no evidence of nefarious action.\u201cCampaign staff was attempting to implement what they believed to be guidance to be strong, to be a strong ally on Ukraine, but also leave the door open for better relations with Russia,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Mr. Burr was also unequivocal in saying that the integrity of the vote itself had been preserved, despite Russian attempts to test the vulnerabilities of 21 state election systems.\u201cWe can certifiably say that no vote totals were affected,\u201d Mr. Burr said, \u201cthat the tallies are accurate.\u201dHe also repeatedly steered away from criticizing Mr. Trump, who has questioned the validity of intelligence assessments about the election. Mr. Burr said any questions of criminal acts were best left to the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cThe committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who were your sources and sub-sources,\u201d Mr. Burr said. Without Mr. Steele\u2019s input, he continued, the committee had found it \u201cimpossible\u201d to rebuild the dossier beyond a certain date.The senators said that the committee itself would not release copies of the ads, but welcomed Facebook doing so if it so chooses as investigators continue to work to better understand the extent of the social media campaign.Mr. Warner said he was optimistic that the companies were \u201crecognizing that threat now.\u201d He said Americans and political candidates deserved to know who was funding advertisements and why individual posts were trending.Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But the companies are grudging at best when it comes to being open about themselves.Their tendency to show more reserve than the people whom they have encouraged to offer up bits of personal data has been especially striking in recent days.Last month, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg invoked \u201ctransparency\u201d when he took to Facebook Live to say the company would share more information about who buys political advertising on its platform. His vow followed Facebook\u2019s admission that it had allowed a shady Russian outfit close to the Kremlin to buy ads \u2014 in rubles! \u2014 that were apparently meant to divide the country and tilt the presidential election.With each repetition of the \u201ctransparency\u201d talk from the big social media platforms, more people begin to see right through it. I wonder if members of the House and Senate intelligence committees will do the same when the platforms\u2019 top executives testify at the upcoming hearings on Russians and the election, assuming they show up.Maybe the flaw in the social-media matrix lies in the whole concept of \u201ctransparency,\u201d anyway. The tech companies and their visionary founders have raised it as the cure-all for oppression and corruption \u2014 even as a path to personal enlightenment.The social-media overlords seem sincere when they describe their high-minded intentions. They talk much less, however, about the money they make from their users\u2019 relinquishment of privacy.The willingness of those who make daily use of Google and social media sites to offer up their likes and dislikes, not to mention the details of their spending habits and internet wanderings, provides Mr. Zuckerberg and his fellows with the personal data that is the holy grail of modern advertising. It also gives them an endless stream of free content to put those ads beside. Their users\u2019 endless posts, spats and vacation pics make for the ultimate reality show.Ms. Goodell\u2019s use of an online disguise suggests how hard it is to be yourself on social media, and the recent experience of the ESPN host Jemele Hill shows even more clearly the perils of mixing private and public personae on Twitter.Pointing up the new tension between journalists\u2019 speaking freely and being part of a team at a news organization like The Times, the White House correspondent Peter Baker noted that the Trump administration \u201cdoesn\u2019t make a distinction\u201d between his tweets and those of his colleagues who do not cover politics.In some cases, candor can seem too much for the platforms themselves. At least, that\u2019s what Ms. McGowan, who received a settlement from Mr. Weinstein in 1997 after she said he assaulted her, accused Twitter of last week.A Twitter spokesman didn\u2019t respond to my email asking if it had an answer to these critics, which is what I should have expected.Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, seemed to break from the social-media chiefs\u2019 habit of avoiding the press last week when she sat for an interview with Mike Allen of Axios, with which Facebook has brokered a deal for several exclusive interviews. As Mr. Allen wrote, the session marked the first public interview with a senior Facebook executive since it had revealed the Russian ad spree.Maybe, I figured, she or Mr. Zuckerberg would share more on their Facebook pages. I clicked my way over to them \u2014 alas, no such luck.I was tempted to express my displeasure by leaving behind orange frowny faces \u2014 but then I remembered our new social media policy and stepped away from the keyboard.Jaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}

The pictures, which were on his computer, were of girls ages 8 to 14 years old performing sex acts with men or posing naked, the Bronx district attorney said.In announcing the indictment, the Bronx district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, said that Msgr. Harry J. Byrne, who lives at the St. John Vianney Center for Retired Priests in the Bronx, regularly showed people who came into his room the disturbing images.\u201cAnyone who views child pornography supports horrific child exploitation,\u201d Ms. Clark said in a news release.Monsignor Byrne pleaded not guilty to the charges.\u201cMonsignor Byrne has dedicated 72 years to charity in the church with an unsullied history,\u201d said his lawyer, Marvin Ray Raskin. \u201cIt is difficult to imagine that at the age of 96, he knowingly understood and is responsible for the content of a particular subject on a computer accessible to numerous people.\u201dMonsignor Byrne was indicted on 37 counts of possessing child pornography. He was arraigned before Justice Robert Neary and released, and is due back in court on Jan. 17. If convicted of the top charge, he could face up to four years in prison and would have to register as a sex offender.The investigation began about five months ago, when officials at the residence notified the district attorney\u2019s office after receiving complaints about Monsignor Byrne. According to the investigation, he sought out the images of young girls using search engines like Google and Bing. Police detectives found the images on his computer, which was in his room at the residence, the district attorney\u2019s office said.Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the New York Archdiocese, said that there have never been any allegations against Monsignor Byrne before.\u201cMonsignor Byrne is 96. He has been retired for more than 20 years,\u201d he said. He added that the archdiocese and the residence where Monsignor. Byrne lives have both been cooperating fully with the investigation.Monsignor Byrne was chancellor of the New York Archdiocese from 1968 to 1970. He was also chairman in the 1960s of its Social Justice Task Force, and in that role, called on all priests to work for social change. As the decades passed, he became critical of younger priests who were not as eager to work on social issues such as housing and poverty as his generation had been.\u201cThe newer priests don\u2019t want to work in the inner cities,\u201d Monsignor Byrne said in a 2000 article in The New York Times. \u201cThey like nice clean white cuffs, pressed surplices.\u201d\u201cThe problem needs to be addressed on different levels: the despicable abuse itself and its reporting; the counterproductive secret settlements and cover-ups; the public relations failures in crisis management; and finally, the basic question of how this phenomenon came to occur in the system of recruiting, training, supervising, evaluating and retaining clergy,\u201d he wrote.Monsignor Byrne was pastor of the Church of the Epiphany in Manhattan\u2019s Gramercy Park neighborhood when he retired in 1996. He had also been pastor of St. Joseph\u2019s Church in Manhattan\u2019s Yorkville neighborhood.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Chief Outlines Investment Shift Away From Passenger Cars", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCar buyers want sport utility vehicles and trucks today. Automakers are feeling pressure to make the electric and self-driving vehicles that may define tomorrow.Ford Motor is betting billions of dollars that it can excel in meeting both of those demands, its new chief executive, Jim Hackett, said Tuesday. And in doing so, it will be moving away from the gasoline-powered passenger cars that have been its hallmark since the Model T.His blueprint for reinvigorating the automaker, whose stock price and profit growth have both been sluggish, also calls for shifting its geographic orientation. Ford now plans to invest more in regions that are growing and profitable, including China, and less on slower-growing regions such as Europe and India, Mr. Hackett said.He said Ford aims to take about $7 billion that was earmarked for developing new cars and put that money toward trucks and sport utility vehicles \u2014 big profit makers as gasoline prices remain low \u2014 as well as electric cars and autonomous vehicles.Putting more emphasis on introducing new trucks and S.U.V.s while also managing the transition to vehicles that lack an internal-combustion engine, or even a driver, will require a dual focus.Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com, said Ford might find the transition difficult. \u201cStraddling the now and the future will be tricky especially in terms of profitability,\u201d she said.At an appearance in New York that was also webcast, Mr. Hackett acknowledged that the company faced significant challenges. \u201cThe decision to change is not easy \u2014 culturally or operationally,\u201d he said, adding that the approaches that have brought success in the past \u201care really no guarantee of future success\u201d as the industry is reshaped.An immediate area of emphasis will be connected vehicles, which collect data about their operations and surroundings that can be used to improve safety and provide new digital services. \u201cOur vehicles will be smart and connected,\u201d Mr. Hackett said.By 2019, all new Ford models in the United States will be able to transmit data back to the company or its business partners, a step toward creating mobility services like ride-hailing and traffic avoidance. The company is planning a similar rollout in China. By 2020, 90 percent of all new models, regardless of market, will offer such connectivity.As part of that push, Ford is developing software that will enable vehicles to communicate with one another and with sensors along roadways and in traffic lights.In addition to revisiting its development priorities, Mr. Hackett vowed that Ford would become more efficient, cutting billions in material costs and engineering expenses over the next five years. Ford has average profit margins of about 6 percent in recent years, short of its goal of 8 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Mr. Hackett said.While Mr. Fields was a polished salesman and marketer, the company struggled to plot a course as the industry was reshaped by electric vehicles, autonomous technology and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.It was a reversal of fortune for Ford, which had been the only one of the three Detroit automakers to escape bankruptcy as the recession and financial crisis set in.When he arrived, Mr. Hackett promised to review all of Ford\u2019s businesses and operations, and prepare a plan within about 100 days for improving its \u201cfitness\u201d and strategic direction. Since then, he has said little in public.In the four and a half months since Mr. Hackett\u2019s ascent, Ford has elevated its share price by 14 percent, including 2 percent in Tuesday\u2019s trading session. But in the same period, G.M.\u2019s shares have risen 33 percent, and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s are up 71 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Villains, Ourselves: A Thriller Roundup", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionIf our heroes disclose who we wish to be, our villains reveal what we fear we may become.Take an autopsy of the word: Villain derives from the Middle English villein, meaning \u201ca rustic, boor,\u201d a person of the lower classes with \u201cuncouth mind and manner.\u201d It\u2019s a pejorative etymology that illustrates not only how elites in the Middle Ages controlled history and language, but also the anxieties around those who were poor yet free, a state considered suspect. Thus, villeins were blamed for the evils disrupting an otherwise peaceful world.And so it has gone throughout history. To be human is to be afraid of the unknown \u2014 of the dark closets of our world, wherever they happen to be. Inside these closets, we have imagined a variety of gruesome things lurking, encapsulating our nightmares and giving a face to our terrors.For a while \u2014 starting with the \u201cEpic of Gilgamesh\u201d chiseled onto a tablet 4,000 years go \u2014 our villains were gods and monsters hiding out in the heavens and oceans, treating humans like their own personal set of Legos. With the rise of Christianity, Satan started to prowl folk tales and epic poems, luring us off the path to salvation. The Industrial Revolution led to a spate of high-ranking, power-hungry scoundrels like Inspector Javert and Dracula. The Victorian fascination with madness gave us an indelible squad of deranged harpies (Miss Havisham, Bertha Rochester, Lady Audley, to name a few). Two world wars, and all the best villains went global, scaling evil across continents, races, the future. The 1960s and Vietnam uprooted our institutions and questioned our freedoms, so we got Nurse Ratched, Catch-22s, Alex and a bunch of droogs. Then there was the Cold War, which hatched a flurry of thugs named Vlad who ruthlessly rolled their R\u2019s as they crept out from behind the Iron Curtain.We can trust villains to be our periodic mental health checkup. They tell us what we\u2019re losing sleep over, how we\u2019re feeling as a whole. Given the state of the world today \u2014 a bombastic political scene, the screen addictions and deluge of news, the conflict that has become our ambient sound \u2014 one would expect an uptick in psychotic cops, underground terrorist networks, tyrants with inexplicable hair and small hands.Instead, a dive into 2017\u2019s crop of thrillers reveals an even more disturbing kind of villain.Of course, this is a post-\u201cDa Vinci Code\u201d world in which no thriller can turn up with a single, white male expert (prone to the odd quip while staring down the end of civilization) without recalling Robert Langdon, he of the black turtlenecks and the knack for symbols. Thankfully, Richtel, a science and technology reporter for The New York Times, ignores this potential comparison and gets down to the nuts and bolts of his story, which he assembles with transcendentalist ease.We descend into the covert inner sanctum at Google X, where our nation\u2019s brightest geeks toil over secret projects within secret projects. We fly to Tanzania during a mysterious pandemic, wander a ski town-turned-ghost town and an unmarked bunker in the Nevada desert. Martin \u2014 and the reader \u2014 have little clue what is causing people to dissolve into a state of catatonia with fixed pupils and flailing limbs until we pick up on the anxiety running through Richtel\u2019s narrative like one of Trent Reznor\u2019s dark guitar chords: \u201cWasn\u2019t this what was happening everywhere? A new hyperskepticism, everything politicized, facts tossed out as partisan and any faith in humanity with it.\u201d\u201cWe can see that the pace of media, the onslaught of conflict-centric communications, stokes the flames of hostility.\u201d\u201cInstead of even trying to figure out what was right, people buried themselves in their devices. People talked to you while looking at their phones, lost in entirely different realities.\u201dA description of Google\u2019s influence sounds indistinguishable from the mysterious infectious diseases Dr. Martin treats: \u201cIt was insinuated in every facet of people\u2019s lives, from work and driving, music, television, every form of communications.\u201d From there the true culprit comes into focus. Though at first glance the solution appears to be only another mastermind who has commandeered technology for personal gain, Richtel leaves us with the more sinister suggestion that the true villain is us and there\u2019s nothing to be done about it. It\u2019s an illness we all have, and there is no cure. Most of us don\u2019t even know that we\u2019re sick.\u201cI can\u2019t tell which is the immune system anymore and which the disease \u2014 whether we\u2019re defending or attacking ourselves,\u201d Jackie, a Google employee whom Martin long ago rescued from death, admits.He might have been talking about the comments section on HuffPost.It comes to light that the mole is motivated by a desire to build \u201cone world\u201d \u2014 a single borderless country that brings to mind Facebook\u2019s hope to \u201cbring the world closer together.\u201d But infinitely more devastating than any double agent is the operating hollowness at the heart of the C.I.A. When superiors question Chang\u2019s loyalty, he submits to three polygraphs; however no lie detector can resolve the problem. Neither innocent nor guilty, he is afflicted by a lack of resolve: \u201cHe occupied a space where things are ambiguous, where people are simultaneously friend and foe, loyal and disloyal, impossible to define until the moment when events intervene and force each particle, each heart, to one side or the other.\u201d The agent is a spinning electron in the atom, eluding capture by a Heisenberg uncertainty principle. There is the probability of an exact location, which holds true only during the nanosecond of perception. Then he is at large again, careening around a moral fog.The Pact is a \u201cfellowship of like-minded individuals\u201d dedicated to ensuring the survival of that exotic, captive animal known as your marriage. It was founded by an Irish woman named Orla who, sequestered on a remote island, wrote a step-by-step system for matrimony, one that is \u201chighly effective, scientifically based.\u201d Pact members will act unilaterally to keep you and your spouse together and happy, no matter what.Few couples of sound mind would agree to such a proposal, particularly one that requires signing a contract filled with an \u201cimpenetrable veil of doublespeak and legalese.\u201d But Alice and Jake \u2014 apparently ascribing to the Trumpian life philosophy, \u201cShoot first and ask questions later\u201d \u2014 agree to Vivian\u2019s terms. They soon find themselves marooned in the guest houses of Pact members, following dinner parties replete with \u201can impressively large stack of profiteroles,\u201d where they chat with women who say things like: \u201cStupid mushrooms. Just when I had the yard looking so perfect, they popped up today.\u201dJake is pulled aside by another Pact member, an old college flame named JoAnne who is paranoid and skittish. She gets down to brass tacks: \u201cI would\u2019ve stopped it, Jake. I could\u2019ve saved you. Now it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs Jake gets shadowed by unmarked black Lexus S.U.V.s, receives mysterious packages and wakes up dazed aboard a Cessna with dried blood on his head, it becomes clear that the force of evil is only a matter of perspective. Like back at the C.I.A., there really are no good guys or bad guys here, only floundering players.Our protagonist is Matthias Glass \u2014 a washed-up writer who, after a well-received debut novel and a stint around New York\u2019s literary scene with a \u201clong-legged, pouty\u201d model (Swann has taken some liberties), returns to the prep school of his youth to solve a mystery that has dogged him since graduation. One night, after an argument, his best friend Fritz Davenport, old-money scion and golden boy, ran away from Matthias in the woods \u2014 and \u201coff the edge of the earth.\u201d He was never seen again.Swann takes his time setting up this mystery, with Matthias chasing down forgotten clues and overlooked conversations while being tested by the boys who sit in his class \u201cin a sort of numb acceptance, as if they were on Novocain.\u201d Swann does a wonderful job depicting these lost boys, the puzzling kinetics of friendship, competition and status, all of which feels out of date and menacing \u2014 the desire to \u201cconquer girls with all the rough ease of a 007,\u201d or how being labeled gay constituted \u201cthe worst, most devastating blow\u201d that left the accused \u201ccast into the outer darkness.\u201dBlackburne feels like an unmanned ship where anything could happen. Yet, when the villain is revealed, there is little move toward accountability, only continued silence and deceit. Evil is left to its own devices, out of reach. Matthias is shaken and powerless. He recalls Hamlet\u2019s letter to Ophelia as detailing a reality where everything should be questioned and nothing is true: \u201cDoubt thou the stars are fire, / Doubt that the sun doth move, / Doubt truth to be a liar, / But never doubt I love.\u201d It\u2019s the same moral haze Harris Chang and the other heroes got lost in, the only difference being a momentary comfort found in friendship.Molly with the capital M is the narrator, the original, true Molly, and Thompson does an excellent job dangling questions of authenticity and judgment before us like meat scraps before caged dogs. Is Molly the good one simply because she is the real Molly, the more advanced Molly? Do we root for her only because we are privy to her thoughts, and thus understand her better than we understand the mute monsters who come lurching out of the dark, the ones whose stories are unknown to us? The book exposes the arbitrary way we choose sides, perceiving a hero and villain through the murky lens of what is personal and understandable.The book works best as a metaphor. For most of us, our most pernicious villain is our self. To keep our higher selves thriving, we must do what Molly does daily \u2014 slay our lesser, reptilian selves, the ones who thrive on fear, ego, conflict. In this book, just as in the others, there is no grand confrontation, no ultimate obliteration of evil. There is only an exhausted d\u00e9tente, a passing of the baton from the killer to the killed. The villain becomes the hero.We are left with a portrait of villainy that feels, like the customer service number for an app, extremely hard to pin down. Villainy is no longer the fixed force of yesteryear. It has no face and no center; it\u2019s spread out across everything. It is confusing and exhausting. And it triumphs, time and again, for it causes heroes to throw up their hands and simply wander off mid-battle, numbed by the apparent futility of it all. If villains are a litmus test for our collective mental state, the prognosis isn\u2019t good. It seems these days we\u2019re not only uncertain of everything and everyone \u2014 foreigners, friends, institutions, experts, the people in our beds, the thoughts in our heads \u2014 we\u2019re also feeling too dazed to do anything about it. If this is the new, all-inclusive, everywhere darkness for 2017, where can evil go in 2018, and beyond?Maybe Cormac McCarthy was right when he wrote, \u201cKeep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.\u201dSo, pass the matches. It\u2019s going to be a long night.Marisha Pessl is the author of the novels \u201cNight Film\u201d and \u201cSpecial Topics in Calamity Physics.\u201d Her next book, \u201cNeverworld Wake,\u201d will be published in 2018.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Italian Schools, Reading, Writing and Recognizing Fake News", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 After reading the horrors in Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno,\u201d Italian students will soon turn to the dangers of the digital age. While juggling math assignments, they\u2019ll also tackle work sheets prepared by reporters from the national broadcaster RAI. And separate from the weekly hour of religion, they will receive a list of what amounts to a new set of Ten Commandments.Among them: Thou shalt not share unverified news; thou shall ask for sources and evidence; thou shall remember that the internet and social networks can be manipulated.The lessons are part of an extraordinary experiment by the Italian government, in cooperation with leading digital companies including Facebook, to train a generation of students steeped in social media how to recognize fake news and conspiracy theories online.\u201cFake news drips drops of poison into our daily web diet and we end up infected without even realizing it,\u201d said Laura Boldrini, the president of the Italian lower house of Parliament, who has spearheaded the project with the Italian Ministry of Education.\u201cIt\u2019s only right to give these kids the possibility to defend themselves from lies,\u201d said Ms. Boldrini, who is left-leaning but not affiliated with any political party. The initiative will be rolled out in 8,000 high schools across the country starting on Oct. 31.Italy, of course, is not alone in trying to find a way to grapple with the global proliferation of propaganda that has sown public confusion and undermined the credibility of powerful institutions.Pope Francis recently announced that he would dedicate his 2018 World Communications Day address to the topic of fake news, and the United States Congress is investigating how Russian agents manipulated Facebook and Twitter to spread false stories and stoke conspiracy theories to sway the 2016 presidential election.But ahead of crucial Italian elections early next year, the country has become an especially fertile ground for digital deceit. Frustrated by economic woes, upset by a migrant crisis and fed a steady diet of partisan media, many Italians subscribe to all kinds of conspiracy theories. It is what they call dietrologia, the belief that there is also always something dietro, or behind, the surface.The Italian passion for seeing intrigue \u2014 whether or not it exists \u2014 around every corner runs deep, said Alessandro Campi, a professor of political science at Perugia University. \u201cAll of this is part of the Italian cultural heritage,\u201d he said.A history of scheming Borgia cardinals, waves of foreign domination, papal crackdowns and corrupt governments had imbued Italians with an abiding distrust in authority, Mr. Campi said.\u201cIt\u2019s not only a tactic,\u201d Mr. Campi said of the movement, which has succeeded in attracting votes from the left and the right with an ideologically ambiguous form of populism. \u201cIt\u2019s their political worldview.\u201dNicola Biondo, a former chief of communications for the Five Star Movement, said that for the party, spreading conspiracies was akin to a policy.\u201cThey use the term Great Powers, never specifying who those powers are,\u201d said Mr. Biondo, who has recently written a book, \u201cSupernova: How Five Star Was Killed,\u201d with another party defector. \u201cIt is a mantra.\u201dMs. Boldrini, sponsor of the new student curriculum, asserts that the web cannot be forfeited to the fringes, and that the government must teach the next generation of Italian voters how to defend themselves against falsehoods and conspiracy theories designed to play on their fears.She said she had included Google and Facebook in the project in an acknowledgment that virtual space is where many young Italians live.Nevertheless, she expressed skepticism in particular about Facebook\u2019s commitment to reining in fake news and hate speech, and recognized the possibility that the Italian school project provided the embattled giant with a much-needed public relations boon.Facebook was quick to applaud the program. Laura Bononcini, chief of public policy for Facebook in Italy, Greece and Malta, said on Tuesday that \u201cthe program is part of an international effort. Education and media literacy are a crucial part of our effort to curb the spread of false news, and collaboration with schools is pivotal.\u201dMs. Boldrini also noted that Facebook was contributing by promoting the initiative through targeted ads to high-school-age users, and she said she hoped that the program, which aimed to show students how their \u201clikes\u201d were monetized and politicized, could become a \u201cpilot program\u201d for Facebook throughout Europe.But some of the Italian course load seems unrealistic. While some tips are useful, such as keeping an eye out for parody URLs, students are also called upon to reach out to experts to verify news stories, essentially asking the students to re-report articles.The program seeks to deputize students as fake-news hunters, showing them how to create their own blogs or social accounts to expose false stories and \u201cshowing how you uncovered it.\u201dIn Italy, that gives them a lot of ground to cover.For months here, conspiracy theorists who reject scientific consensus have connected vaccinations to medical conditions including autism in children, often blaming pharmaceutical companies as a dark force behind the medical practice. It was an issue that struck a nerve in Italy and played right into the wheelhouse of the Five Star Movement\u2019s distrust of expertise and authority.In May, amid a measles outbreak, Italy strengthened its vaccination requirements for school-age children, prompting so-called No-Vax activists to protest outside the Italian Parliament for the right to choose.His wildly popular blog has alleged that some vaccines \u201ccan kill,\u201d and websites, such as La Fucina, run by another party leader, Davide Casaleggio, have published anti-vaccine reports.\u201cIt\u2019s what the pharmaceutical companies do, and it\u2019s questionable,\u201d Paola Barile, 65, said as she stood with a Five Star Movement flag wrapped around her shoulders at a protest last week in front of Parliament. \u201cThe spell has been broken for us also on vaccines.\u201dAt the same rally, Five Star activists screamed \u201cshame\u201d and railed against the political parties, right and left, for joining forces to draft a new electoral law they considered (maybe correctly this time) designed to keep the movement out of power.But the Five Star Movement is not the only political force to have profited from fake news, and students are not the only ones who can be deceived by it.Last weekend, Gian Marco Centinaio, a senator from the Northern League, a right-leaning party, acknowledged that he had put on Facebook a post, subsequently shared 18,000 times, of a picture of a man identified as Ms. Boldrini\u2019s brother, and complained how the news programs \u201cdon\u2019t cover\u201d the man\u2019s no-show job that paid 47,000 euros, or more than $55,000, a month. The man in the image was not her brother, and none of the allegations were true.Mr. Centinaio called the post a joke and said, \u201cPeople should be less credulous.\u201dA healthy dose of skepticism is exactly what the new Italian program hopes students will adopt.\u201cIf people are prepared, educated on digital,\u201d Ms. Boldrini said, \u201cmaybe they don\u2019t fall for it.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Showdown Brews Between Amazon and Alibaba, Far From Home", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 From this concrete warehouse perched on the edge of a potentially vast new market for online shopping, the Alibaba Group of China hopes to beat Amazon one head of lettuce at a time.Under the glare of fluorescent lights, green-vested workers carefully wrap fruit, cheese and other perishables for delivery by vans to a growing group of Singaporeans who prefer to do their shopping online. On a nearby wall, printouts show the sorts of defects that customers have complained about in the past: overripe avocados, smelly spinach, rotten honeydews.\u201cIt\u2019s getting better and better,\u201d said Vikram Rupani, president of RedMart, an online grocery company based in Singapore that is part of Alibaba\u2019s push into the region, \u201cbut it\u2019s a continuous process that never ends.\u201dAlibaba and Amazon already dominate the business of selling stuff online in their home markets. Increasingly, they are competing against each other on neutral ground.Both are spending billions of dollars on Asia \u2014 particularly Southeast Asia and India \u2014 as they look for a place that could repeat China\u2019s explosive transformation into the world\u2019s biggest online shopping market.Amazon has committed $5 billion to India, where it lures customers to sign up for its Prime service, which includes Western movies and television shows, for a small fraction of the $99 annual membership price in the United States. Alibaba has invested roughly $500 million for stakes in both Paytm \u2014 India\u2019s largest mobile payments platform \u2014 and its e-commerce affiliate, Paytm Mall.Alibaba\u2019s bigger bet is in Southeast Asia. It has spent more than $2 billion to take control of Lazada, a five-year-old online shopping company based in Singapore and doing business in six countries. Last year, Lazada bought RedMart, the online retail grocery.Over about the same period, India\u2019s market could increase six times to a similar amount, Bain & Company, a consulting firm, projects.Alibaba and Amazon are seeking consumers like Janice Lee Fang, a Singaporean who decided she needed to buy a robot to amuse a 6-year-old daughter home sick from school. Through Amazon\u2019s Prime Now service, introduced in Singapore in July, she bought a Sphero SPRK Plus \u2014 a clear plastic ball that can skitter across the floor with a tap of a smartphone \u2014 that arrived in less than a day.\u201cI was thrilled,\u201d said Ms. Fang, who said she also uses Alibaba\u2019s services. \u201cI had time to unbox it and teach her how to use it. It\u2019s a last-minute shopping savior.\u201dBut Southeast Asia is no China. A diffuse area of 600 million people, the region is divided by politics, language and culture. Some places are modern, like Singapore. Other places lack the roads and other infrastructure to get people what they need.\u201cIt\u2019s a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural areas, separated by large distances and \u2014 in the Philippines and Indonesia \u2014 by water,\u201d said Mike Booker, a partner at the Southeast Asian arm of Bain. \u201cCash on delivery is still prevalent, and other local players are in the fray.\u201dThe challenges have forced Lazada, Alibaba\u2019s biggest Southeast Asian operation, to get creative.In Vietnam, local post offices take customer returns and give cash refunds. In Malaysia, customers can collect merchandise from lockers at 7-Eleven stores. And in the Philippines, Lazada uses gas stations as places where merchants can drop off their goods for delivery personnel to pick up.\u201cWe\u2019re in the super, super, super early days,\u201d said Inanc Balci, who oversees Lazada operations in the Philippines.Alibaba\u2019s international arm has seen its latest quarterly sales more than double in a year, in part from Lazada\u2019s contribution. Still, Lazada and its RedMart subsidiary remain a tiny, and unprofitable, part of Alibaba\u2019s empire. Max Bittner, Lazada\u2019s chief executive, said its Chinese parent has been willing to spend money to build its delivery capabilities and draw more customers.\u201cE-commerce is an economy of scale game,\u201d Mr. Bittner said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel constrained in any way. I can go after this opportunity with the amount of firepower I need.\u201dAmazon so far counts Singapore as its only Southeast Asian market, though industry experts widely expect it will expand into other countries. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.Southeast Asia could offer a test of their vastly different business models on neutral turf.Alibaba has a long lead over Amazon and is building up its infrastructure across Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, for example, it took a minority stake in August in another online marketplace, Tokopedia. Experts say Amazon could fight back by offering online Western movies and television programs as it does in the United States, which could increase its appeal with younger customers.Amazon stumbled in Singapore initially when the service proved too popular, forcing it to turn away customers. But since then the two companies have amped up their efforts to deliver more quickly to a growing group of customers.At the RedMart warehouse on a recent visit, workers packed cartons \u2014 sometimes nine at a time \u2014 from bins holding piles of cereal boxes and canned fruits and vegetables. For those who offer ways to improve the process, merit awards include movie tickets, vouchers and cash of up to $1,000.Competing in the market is likely to be expensive, thanks to customer price cuts and rebates in addition to expansion costs.\u201cIt\u2019s fabulous,\u201d said Uma Parameswar, a Singaporean who works in fine arts management. Over two and a half years of using RedMart, she said, only once did she receive fruit that was less than fresh.The enticements make her even more inclined to shop online. She says RedMart gives her a 5 percent discount on grocery bills plus discounts on using Uber\u2019s ride-hailing and other services.\u201cIt\u2019s saved me probably $200 in the last three or four months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Driverless Cars Brake for Golf Carts", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Molly Jackson, an 82-year-old retired nurse, was sitting in the back seat of a self-driving taxi when the vehicle jerked to a halt at a crossing as its computer vision spotted an approaching golf cart.When the vehicle, a modified Ford Fusion developed by a start-up named Voyage, started to inch forward, it abruptly stopped again as the golfers pressed ahead and cut in front of the car.Ms. Jackson seemed unfazed by the bumpy ride. As a longtime resident of the Villages Golf and Country Club, a retirement community in San Jose, Calif., she knew all about aggressive golf cart drivers.\u201cI like that; we made a good stop there,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cI stop for them. They say we don\u2019t have to, but I do.\u201dVoyage is starting to expand its driverless taxi service beyond a small test in the Villages, a gated community of about 4,000 residents where the average age is 76. Retirement communities, with their tightly controlled roads, can be an ideal proving ground for autonomous vehicles.In the Villages, there are 15 miles of roads where autonomous vehicles can learn how to navigate other cars, pedestrians, golf carts, animals, roundabouts and many other obstacles.The speed limit, just 25 miles an hour, helps reduce the risk if something goes wrong. And because it is private property, the company does not have to share ride information with regulators and it can try new ideas without as much red tape.Cars that can drive themselves could be a great benefit to older people. Residents at the Villages say that once people stop driving, they often pull back from activities and interacting with friends.Ms. Jackson, who has lived here for three decades, was one of Voyage\u2019s first test passengers. For now, the company is limiting rides in two driverless cars (with a third arriving in two weeks) to a busy, two-mile loop. A person stays in the driver\u2019s seat in case something goes awry. And the plan is for any Village resident to be able to summon one of Voyage\u2019s cars through a smartphone app for free door-to-door service.Voyage was formed this year after spinning out of the online education start-up Udacity. How an online education start-up ended up operating an autonomous taxi service in a retirement community is an \u201conly in Silicon Valley\u201d story.It started with a drive from nearby Mountain View to San Francisco. When Udacity started to offer a self-driving car curriculum, a team of employees created a challenge for themselves: Make a 32-mile drive on busy El Camino Real during rush hour and without human intervention.After five months of failure, the team finally completed the route. Sensing an opportunity, Udacity executives spun out the self-driving car project into a new company. Voyage raised $5.6 million from investors.It was a good match. Last year, the Villages had conducted a survey about what amenities residents wanted to see over the next 15 years. Among the top answers: autonomous cars and a shuttle service.Four years ago, the Villages considered a shuttle, but decided it was too costly to have a full-time driver. There is a service called the Villages Medical Auxiliary to take people to the doctor\u2019s office or the supermarket, but there is a shortage of volunteer drivers and people need to make appointments two days in advance. It pushes residents to keep driving when they shouldn\u2019t.Ask almost anyone at the Villages and he or she can tell you about an accident: the driver who drove into a pond or the person who hit the accelerator instead of the brake and took out the tennis court fence.\u201cThe driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have,\u201d said Bill Devincenzi, a former board president of the Villages whose term expired in June.Another issue that could be solved by driverless cars is a shortage of parking spots. Like many of the Villages\u2019 residents, Nancy Green, 88, is active. She swims three times a week, regularly attends wine-tasting dinners and participates in a weekly bridge game. But after three back operations, she struggles to walk long distances.For popular events, she sometimes arrives an hour early to secure one of the few handicap spots. If none are available, she turns around and goes home. She said she did not like eating dinner at the clubhouse at 5:30 p.m., but the chances of finding a parking spot at her preferred time of 7 p.m. were \u201cslim and none.\u201d\u201cFrom that perspective, I think the self-driving car would be great,\u201d she said.But what seemed like a done deal hit a roadblock this year. The agreement to offer self-driving car rides in the retirement community almost fell apart when negotiations hit an impasse over insurance. California requires autonomous vehicles to have $5 million of coverage, but the Villages insisted on 50 percent more coverage because it is a private community with more liability risk.\u201cWe\u2019d call the Geicos and Progressives of the world and asked them, \u2018Do you do self-driving car insurance?\u2019\u201d said Oliver Cameron, Voyage\u2019s 29-year-old chief executive. \u201cThe answer was no.\u201dWorking with an insurance broker, Voyage delved into \u201cexotic insurance\u201d policies and had to pay twice as much per car for its insurance policy versus the standard $5 million coverage.The insurer, Munich Re, also had an unusual request. It wanted data \u2014 any data \u2014 produced by the cars. Because this is a new field, even insurers wanted to understand the potential risks of self-driving cars. Voyage agreed to hand over nonidentifiable, sensor data.Coupled with the fact that Voyage and not Udacity would be operating in the Villages, some in the community were concerned that they had fallen for a bait and switch.To sweeten the deal for the Villages, Voyage offered them an equity stake \u2014 the equivalent of what it would grant a new hire.For the last few months, Voyage has been testing at the Villages. The cars \u2014 nicknamed Homer and Marge after the characters on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d \u2014 have often prompted questions from curious onlookers in the Villages.Are you from Google? (No.)What\u2019s that spinning top on the roof? (It\u2019s a sensor that helps the car see the world around it.)How do I invest? (Flattering, but we\u2019re not taking new investors now.)Then, there were the skeptics who questioned whether driverless cars were safer. Mr. Cameron said the residents\u2019 concerns were a welcome reality check from the hype of Silicon Valley. \u201cIt\u2019s preparing us for the sorts of questions many millions have on their mind when it comes to the technology,\u201d he said.Ms. Jackson, who still drives regularly and shuttles friends to church, activities and other community events, said she could not distinguish between human driver and machine during her ride.\u201cI thought it was great,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t fearful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Careers for Women in Technology Companies Are a Global Challenge", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen TodayEuropean women working in the technology field are very familiar with the concerns expressed by their counterparts in the United States \u2014 too few girls and young women studying science and technology in school, gender bias and sexual harassment in the workplace.But, they say, the problems play out in different ways.While American companies are primarily the ones in the spotlight, they have a global reach, not just because of their size, but because of the ways their actions resonate around the world. And even if gender issues elsewhere don\u2019t make headlines, women on both sides of the Atlantic point to similar problems \u2014 although political and cultural disparities create different challenges and opportunities.For example, while being a working mother, especially in high-powered technology fields, can be difficult, the paid maternity leaves and state-subsidized child care available in many European countries make life simpler.\u201cI was very full of myself when younger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been eye-opening.\u201dBut one thing making her life easier is \u201cthat the state is supporting family so strongly,\u201d Ms. Hindriks said. \u201cWe have 18 months\u2019 paid paternity and maternity leave. Preschool costs nothing. Taking care of a child is not an issue.\u201dOne the biggest cultural differences she found is how surprised people were that, as a mother of three, she opted to work full-time.\u201cYou know that the people taking care of your babies while you work are professionals,\u201d she said. \u201cI see friends here who have little kids who are super-conflicted. If they\u2019re financially well-off, it doesn\u2019t seem right not to take care of the kids yourself. My kids are the best part of my life, but not the only part.\u201dIn Israel, perhaps because military service is mandatory for women and men, there is a greater sense of equality, she said, and there are more women entrepreneurs in technology. In Switzerland, walking into a technology conference, \u201calmost everyone one around you is a gray-haired male in a suit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, because when doing business with someone, you look for something in common, and we\u2019re asymmetrical \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m young, they\u2019re old, I\u2019m a woman, they\u2019re male, I\u2019m short they\u2019re tall.\u2019 \u201dMs. Imafidon, 28, agreed. \u201cI\u2019m young, a person of color, a woman and I talk like a person from East London \u2014 you could discriminate against me for a number of reasons.\u201dShe said she hasn\u2019t experienced much gender bias, probably because, she said, she is very confident and not especially perceptive about what other people think of her. At 20 she was one of the youngest people ever to be awarded a master\u2019s degree in mathematics and computer science by the University of Oxford, and in 2013 the British Computer Society, a professional organization, named her its young information technology professional of the year.But she is worried about the small number of young women entering the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, collectively known as STEM, and the messages they\u2019re getting about women in technology.The different educational systems in the United States and Britain mean that each has its own strengths and weaknesses when teaching STEM, she said; British schools, unlike schools in the United States, have a national curriculum; STEM teaching in the United States, on the other hand, \u201cmight be more patchy, but it can also be more creative.\u201dShe feels, she said, a \u201cbasic condescension\u201d as a woman in tech. \u201cI feel I have to convince them that I know the technology, and they\u2019re surprised when I do.\u201dProf. Evers has had her share of inappropriate remarks and experiences, she said. One time, a more senior male colleague was interested in whether she shaved her armpits and pulled at her shirt to take a look.\u201cTwo years ago, I would never have talked about it; it\u2019s not easy to do when you\u2019re still in the running for senior positions,\u201d she said. But over the past few years, she has been more outspoken.\u201cI wasn\u2019t willing to show what I saw as my weak side before,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to display a persona at work that is super capable, but that is selfish.\u201dAfter all, as she and others said, it\u2019s not just about filling the pipeline by encouraging women to enter STEM fields, but making sure that women who already in it are treated well and promoted.\u201cWhat I see in Europe and the U.S. is lots of encouragement for girls in STEM. It\u2019s not where it needs to be, but I do see more encouragement in schools and even in families,\u201d she said. Through mentoring and tutoring, she does her part to try to get more young women to enter the STEM field.In Asia, in general, \u201cwhile things are improving, the bosses are still older men and may be less willing to accept\u201d young women as engineers, Ms. Sweeney said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like it was 20 to 30 years ago in the U.S.\u201d And it is women with more financial means, she said, who can more easily break through the gender barrier.Nonetheless, she said, \u201cI strongly believe that female representation in tech could definitely be higher. I think the general resistance could stem from preconceived notions that a career in tech would only revolve around programming.\u201dMs. Sweeney said all women in all countries also have to move away from the idea that they \u201chave to be super smart to be in science and engineering. It\u2019s not just for the best and the brightest,\u201d she said. \u201cBoys and men assume that if they are 30 to 40 percent qualified, they\u2019ll go for it. Girls and women feel they need to be 80 percent qualified to attempt it. We have to get past the idea that you need to be exceptional, not just good. Believe me, the men aren\u2019t all exceptional.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Great Concierge Debate: Digital or Personal?", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrendingLike travel agencies, department stores and shoeshine stands, the concierge profession is one that has been brutishly hammerlocked by modernization. But in Chicago, one former luxury concierge has marshaled the energy and expertise of her battered colleagues to take an \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em\u201d approach.Do you prefer crowds to serenity? Big ol\u2019 burgers to kale salad? Blending in with the locals to sticking out like a sore tourist with a girthy fanny pack weighing down your waist? These are the sorts of preferences that When in Roam\u2019s users make known in an online questionnaire so that the responding concierge can tidily tailor a client\u2019s experience.When in Roam is still in its infancy: Its concierges currently provide just a couple itineraries a week, as well as answering a follow-up question should clients want their interaction to last a bit longer. (Anything beyond that will cost more; a contractor\u2019s take is $12 per $29 itinerary.)But in attempting to whisk her profession into the Digital Age, might Ms. Miller be inadvertently cannibalizing it, byte by byte?\u201cFor the most part, we\u2019re trying to reach users who don\u2019t have access to a [physical] concierge,\u201d she said. \u201cThis might be someone staying in an Airbnb or with family or friends, or hotels without services. At a time when concierges are more important than ever, hotels are eliminating positions. We can both Google \u2018best restaurants in Chicago\u2019 and get the same answers. But is your best restaurant my best restaurant? No. It takes the concierge to qualify that.\u201dHerein, Ms. Miller acknowledges Airbnb, the hotel industry\u2019s arch enemy. Somewhat ironically, Airbnb recently launched an initiative to have its hosts act more like hospitality experts, replete with recommended activities, cucumber water and maybe a mint on the pillow for good measure.While he acknowledges that When in Roam \u201cis an option\u201d for people who choose not to stay at full-service hotels, he said he feels that the service is \u201ccold and non-interactive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no better than something that you could find online,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the great joys of having a concierge is you build this wonderful relationship with them. They get to know your life and share their expertise. That face time is so valuable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s kind of where the concierge profession is trending,\u201d he says of his auxiliary gig\u2019s virtual bent.Besides the beer money that When in Roam currently provides for him, Mr. Perceful says his involvement with Ms. Miller\u2019s company forces him to stay engaged with parts of the city far from the downtown core.\u201cThere\u2019s very little variance among customers in a five-star hotel, whereas with When in Roam, you\u2019ll get bachelorette parties staying at an Airbnb on Capitol Hill or someone staying with their grandmother in Fremont,\u201d he said, referring to two of Seattle\u2019s more happening neighborhoods.When I requested an itinerary from When in Roam, I asked for destinations and activities in and around West Seattle, a peninsula that\u2019s accessible by either passenger ferry or bridge from mainland Seattle. Coincidentally, Mr. Perceful was the one who snapped up my request, and nimbly pointed me to such hyper-local haunts as Mashiko (sustainable sushi), Sisters and Brothers (hot chicken) and La Rustica, a family-owned Italian restaurant with a location so obscure that you\u2019d have to crash your bicycle into it if someone didn\u2019t tell you where it was.\u201cThe restaurant doesn\u2019t even have a web page,\u201d Mr. Perceful noted in his summary.That\u2019s true, but the stove sure works.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump to Open Skies to More Drone Testing", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday loosened some rules for commercial drones, including for package deliveries, by allowing broader testing by companies like Amazon and Wing, a part of Alphabet.The Transportation Department will work with states, towns and tribal communities to create pilot programs, the White House said. For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year.The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming.

{"Headline": "London\u2019s Uber Ban Raises Questions on Race and Immigration", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 There is one question that bothers Sahrab Shinwari: \u201cWould they have banned Uber if its drivers had been white and English?\u201dBut at street level, the city was buzzing with more uncomfortable questions \u2014 like the one that troubled Mr. Shinwari, himself an Uber driver who came to London from Afghanistan nine years ago. He is one of the company\u2019s 40,000 drivers in London. Most of them are nonwhite and many of them immigrants, something which has sharpened racial divisions in the working class at a time when incomes at the bottom are squeezed, and the city\u2019s post-Brexit future is still uncertain.\u201cWhat about us?\u201d asked Samir Sahel, another Uber driver and a second-generation Indian immigrant. \u201cAre we not part of the working class?\u201dWhat most frustrated the dozen Uber drivers interviewed for this article was that labor standards, so widely mentioned by Uber\u2019s critics over the past 10 days, did not actually come into the licensing decision.\u201cTfL used a terrible excuse,\u201d said Mr. Shinwari, the Afghan Uber driver. \u201cThey are the ones who issue our license. They vet black-cab and they vet us. We even pay them to vet us!\u201dRather than addressing longstanding concerns over low incomes, long hours and minimal benefits, the ruling further stigmatized Uber drivers as potential criminals, he said. Minutes after Friday\u2019s decision one of his friends had called him and joked: \u201cYou\u2019re a rapist, innit.\u201dBut Mr. Shinwari also resents Uber for asking drivers to lobby the mayor on the company\u2019s behalf. \u201cIt\u2019s like the jaguar asking the deer to be friends,\u201d he said. In the past two years, his income has roughly halved, he said. When he joined Uber two years ago, there were about 20,000 drivers on the road. That figure has doubled since. \u201cThere are not enough jobs for all of us,\u201d he said, echoing a popular complaint from traditional cabbies. Meanwhile, the company increased the commission it takes on new drivers\u2019 fares to 25 percent.James Farrar, a former Uber driver who is fighting the company in court over demands to provide holiday pay and better wages, said the omission of any discussion of Uber\u2019s labor practices in the ruling suggested that the regulator and the mayor \u201cwere O.K.\u201d with them.\u201cTFL did not stand up for workers\u2019 rights,\u201d he said, pointing to other ride-hailing companies like Taxify and Lyft waiting eagerly to take Uber\u2019s place in London should it lose an appeal against the ruling. \u201cIt sent a clear signal: With or without Uber, the door is wide open to operate with these conditions.\u201dUber drivers across town, continuing to work as the decision was being appealed, fretted about making down payments on their cars and putting food on the table for their children. And they worried that tensions could escalate with black-cab drivers, emboldened by the ruling and yet conscious that a lengthy appeals process might lie ahead.Zahra Bakkali, a Moroccan Uber driver and mother of five, was working in her white Prius when she first heard on the radio that Uber would not be relicensed. She had been messaging with other female drivers on her Super Uber Ladies WhatsApp group about how much more \u201caggressive and violent\u201d the cabbies would become once the license was renewed. After the ruling, the conversation changed.\u201cWhat are we gonna do?\u201d one wrote.\u201cI was solely relying on this for income,\u201d another worried.\u201cThe cabbies will have a field day,\u201d a third added gloomily.London\u2019s taxi wars predate the Brexit referendum but have been fought along similar dividing lines. \u201cThere is a big difference between us and them,\u201d said Mark Thompson, a 52-year-old black-cab driver.Malcolm Shaffron, who has been driving a black cab for nearly 50 years, argues that passengers are not safe with Uber drivers because they \u201ccannot drive\u201d and they \u201ccannot be properly vetted.\u201d\u201cHow do you check the criminal record of someone who is fresh off the boat from Sudan or from the desert of Ethiopia?\u201d he asked.But many Uber drivers said that they had been the victims of aggression. Mr. Shinwari says he has been spat upon and suffered racist slurs. The day after last year\u2019s Brexit referendum, he said, a black-cab driver cut open his forehead with a beer glass, sending him to the hospital.Mr. Sahel, who grew up in the East End of London and now lives in Essex, just beyond the city\u2019s boundaries, five doors down from a black-cab driver. \u201cWe never even acknowledge each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how serious the tension is.\u201dThere is one thing most traditional cabbies and Uber drivers agree on: Most doubt that Uber will leave London, or that the nationalist impulses that fueled Brexit can stop the march of technological progress.\u201cWhat are they going to shut down next? Google?\u201d asked Sergejs Malacenko, a Latvian Uber driver who arrived in Britain in 2004.Or as Mr. Shaffron, the cabby, put it: \u201cWe won a battle, Uber will win the war.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paul S. Otellini, Who Led Intel and Saw It Grow Even More, Dies at 66", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paul S. Otellini, who as chief executive expanded Intel\u2019s already commanding chip-making business but failed to build a company franchise in mobile phones, died on Monday at his family\u2019s second home in Sonoma County, Calif. He was 66.Where Mr. Grove and his immediate predecessor, Craig R. Barrett, were tough taskmasters, Mr. Otellini was known for a softer, more personable touch. \u201cHe solved problems without yelling like some of his predecessors,\u201d Mr. Barrett wrote in an email. \u201cProbably the best decision I made as C.E.O. was to recommend him as my replacement.\u201dThrough the 1980s and \u201990s, Intel solidified its position in personal computers as advances in manufacturing produced chips that ran software faster. But Mr. Otellini faced a series of challenges when he became chief executive in May 2005.At the time, Intel\u2019s chips consumed too much power and generated too much heat. The company\u2019s rival Advanced Micro Devices had introduced attractive processors that grabbed a sizable chunk of the market. AMD followed up with an antitrust lawsuit against Intel that prompted government investigations by the authorities in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe.Mr. Otellini battled back by listening to customers, former colleagues said. That approach was recognized when he got an onstage hug in June 2005 from Steve Jobs, then Apple\u2019s chief executive, who had agreed to switch to Intel technology for the company\u2019s popular Macintosh computer line.Mr. Otellini pushed Intel to develop more energy-efficient chips, fueling a trend in which laptop computers were beginning to supplant desktop models. In the case of winning Apple\u2019s Mac business, Mr. Otellini also agreed to offer very low prices.\u201cHe was willing to take an upfront hit to forge a partnership,\u201d Andy Bryant, Intel\u2019s chairman, said.But Mr. Otellini later admitted to making a major miscue in the mobile market. Those devices were mainly built using chip technology developed by ARM Holdings, which drew much less power than PC chips and was licensed to multiple manufacturers that competed on price and features.Intel for a time built ARM chips, too, but that business was unprofitable. Mr. Otellini dropped it, opting to court phone makers with Intel\u2019s mainstay x86 chip design.Intel was still in the running as a supplier when Apple was developing the first iPhone, which was introduced in 2007, ushering in what would become a giant market for smartphones. Mr. Otellini underestimated the iPhone\u2019s sales potential and viewed Apple\u2019s price demands as onerous.Though Intel missed the smartphone boom, it won over internet companies like Google and Facebook on the way to grabbing nearly all of the market for chips used in data centers. In all, Intel estimated, the company\u2019s annual revenue rose to $53 billion from $34 billion under Mr. Otellini.He also left a legacy as a peacemaker when Intel settled its court battles with regulators and A.M.D. \u201cThat was driven by Otellini more than anyone else,\u201d said Hector Ruiz, a former A.M.D. chief who launched the litigation.Paul Stevens Otellini, the son of Dave Otellini, a butcher, and his wife, Evelyn, was born in San Francisco on Oct. 12, 1950. (He continued to live there despite a long commute to Intel\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara.) He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from the University of San Francisco and an M.B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley.He is survived by his second wife, of 30 years, Sandy Otellini; his son, Patrick; and his daughter, Alexis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I. Talent", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "Nearly all big tech companies have an artificial intelligence project, and they are willing to pay experts millions of dollars to help get it done.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s start-ups have always had a recruiting advantage over the industry\u2019s giants: Take a chance on us and we\u2019ll give you an ownership stake that could make you rich if the company is successful.Now the tech industry\u2019s race to embrace artificial intelligence may render that advantage moot \u2014 at least for the few prospective employees who know a lot about A.I.Typical A.I. specialists, including both Ph.D.s fresh out of school and people with less education and just a few years of experience, can be paid from $300,000 to $500,000 a year or more in salary and company stock, according to nine people who work for major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them. All of them requested anonymity because they did not want to damage their professional prospects.Well-known names in the A.I. field have received compensation in salary and shares in a company\u2019s stock that total single- or double-digit millions over a four- or five-year period. And at some point they renew or negotiate a new contract, much like a professional athlete.At the top end are executives with experience managing A.I. projects. In a court filing this year, Google revealed that one of the leaders of its self-driving-car division, Anthony Levandowski, a longtime employee who started with Google in 2007, took home over $120 million in incentives before joining Uber last year through the acquisition of a start-up he had co-founded that drew the two companies into a court fight over intellectual property.Salaries are spiraling so fast that some joke the tech industry needs a National Football League-style salary cap on A.I. specialists. \u201cThat would make things easier,\u201d said Christopher Fernandez, one of Microsoft\u2019s hiring managers. \u201cA lot easier.\u201dThere are a few catalysts for the huge salaries. The auto industry is competing with Silicon Valley for the same experts who can help build self-driving cars. Giant tech companies like Facebook and Google also have plenty of money to throw around and problems that they think A.I. can help solve, like building digital assistants for smartphones and home gadgets and spotting offensive content.Most of all, there is a shortage of talent, and the big companies are trying to land as much of it as they can. Solving tough A.I. problems is not like building the flavor-of-the-month smartphone app. In the entire world, fewer than 10,000 people have the skills necessary to tackle serious artificial intelligence research, according to Element AI, an independent lab in Montreal.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d said Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, who previously worked at Google. \u201cThey are anxious to ensure that they\u2019ve got this small cohort of people\u201d who can work on this technology.\u201cIt is hard to compete with that, especially if you are one of the smaller companies,\u201d said Jessica Cataneo, an executive recruiter at the tech recruiting firm CyberCoders.By 2013, Google, Facebook and a few other companies started to recruit the relatively few researchers who specialized in these techniques. Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft\u2019s Skype phone service.With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.\u201cThere is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.\u201cThere are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,\u201d Mr. Zettlemoyer said. \u201cThe salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.\u201dThe basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call \u201ca dark art.\u201d Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with Google, and I don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. \u201cSo I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.\u201dBut the industry\u2019s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won\u2019t be alleviated for years.\u201cOf course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,\u201d Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. \u201cIt takes many years to train a Ph.D.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Tax Plan Rollout Nears: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We\u2019re watching to see how any charges that Robert Mueller files that are related to the Russia investigation affect this week\u2019s tax plan rollout. More on that in a minute.S. & P. futures were down this morning, perhaps because of the newest wrinkle in what was already a complicated legislative process for enacting tax cuts. Republicans still don\u2019t seem to agree on what should be in the plan.The plan is to keep the tough trade-offs in the bill secret until after Halloween, then reach Thanksgiving with bills passed by the House and Senate and hit New Year\u2019s Day with a bill on Mr. Trump\u2019s desk. That\u2019s close to financial-crisis speed, pushing Congress into a kind of emergency lawmaking mode it typically uses only when inaction means cataclysm.Based on Mr. Trump\u2019s own pronouncement, we could learn this week his choice to lead the Federal Reserve. It\u2019s still a guess as to whom the president will nominate \u2014 or even whether that nominee will share the White House zeal for financial deregulation.That may throw up some obstacles to Mr. Powell\u2019s confirmation by the Senate. More from Mr. Appelbaum\u2019s article:\u201cSenator Scott is looking for fresh leadership at the Federal Reserve, and Mr. Powell would have to answer serious concerns both old and new at any potential nomination hearing he might have before the Senate Banking Committee,\u201d said a spokesman for Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. What\u2019s fascinating is the fault line between Mr. Bannon and his particular brand of nationalism, and Mr. Singer, who is considered a \u201cglobalist\u201d \u2014 and has ties to Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.But it\u2019s unclear whether the White House will turn on Mr. Singer. Yes, the Elliott Management founder was an early backer of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement. But he has since signed onto the team of White House supporters, donating to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and providing money for the Republican tax overhaul campaign.Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up:Pushing for answers will be Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. His criticism of technology companies may be surprising, considering he built a fortune as a tech and telecommunication investor and executive. But he wants to ward off further problems.\u201cWhat I fear is 2018. If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I.,\u201d he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.In other problems for tech companies:Information wars in emerging markets may not represent as big a threat to Facebook\u2019s business as angry lawmakers in Washington. But people are dying, and communities are tearing themselves apart with the tools Facebook has built. That should qualify as an even greater emergency in Menlo Park.Shareholder activism, of a sort, appears to be brewing in the N.F.L. as well.\u201cYou don\u2019t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,\u201d one unidentified owner said on the call, according to ESPN.Investing in research and development, and in takeovers, appears to be generating bigger gains these days. That\u2019s the key point from the latest weekly note by David Kostin, Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief United States equity strategist:Companies investing for growth have outperformed firms returning cash to shareholders by 21 percentage points since 2016 (+17 percent vs. -5 percent). This reversal represents a notable shift because firms with the highest combined buyback and dividend yields have outperformed capex and R.&D. spenders by an annualized 170 basis points since 1991.\u201cOur company\u2019s success is the result of our focus on identifying early stage consumer trends, and this is another step in that direction.\u201dM. & A.Policy and LegalBanks and BankingPrivate Capital (P.E. and V.C.)Money ManagersBusiness and EconomyAdvertisement"}

The public adored the companies\u2019 new devices, educators embraced their tools and politicians extolled their contributions to the economy. Even traditionally powerful voices, like media and telecom businesses, found little success in criticizing the technology industry.The reviews site Yelp, which has long complained about the size and power of Google, has filed a new federal antitrust complaint against the search giant. Media organizations are arguing, to a more receptive Capitol Hill, that internet businesses should have the same advertising disclosure rules that print and television companies do.\u201cWe\u2019ve had low points, when we were out of energy and felt like we weren\u2019t heard,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp. \u201cBut we feel we have a clean slate now.\u201d\u201cBefore, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cBut now the halo is a bit off these companies.\u201dInternet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill. House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending \u2014 a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier. Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers. They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.\u201cIt is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill. In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business,\u201d Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, \u201cand that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.\u201dThe tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well. In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission. In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.\u201cIn the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Google and Facebook and the future of the news business,\u201d Mr. Chavern said in an interview before the hearing.Even nonprofit consumer interest groups are taking advantage of the situation.

{"Headline": "McCain in Twilight: An Unfettered Voice Against Trumpism", "Date": "2017-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain, the sometimes cantankerous, often charming and eternally irrepressible Republican from Arizona, has never minced words. But in the twilight of a long and storied career, as he fights a virulent form of brain cancer, the 81-year-old senator has found a new voice.In twin speeches \u2014 one in July, where he issued a call to bipartisanship in the Senate, and another in Philadelphia this past week, where he railed against \u201chalf-baked, spurious nationalism\u201d \u2014 Mr. McCain has taken on both his colleagues and President Trump. In the process, his friends and fellow senators say, he has carved out a new role for himself on Capitol Hill: elder statesman and truth-teller.\u201cEven if John were not ill, with his experience and age, there is a part of you that I think begins to focus on your legacy,\u201d said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a close friend of Mr. McCain\u2019s. But with cancer, Mr. Biden said, \u201che\u2019s in the fight of his life, and he knows it.\u201dHaving won re-election last year, Mr. McCain was already free to speak his mind. Were he to run again in 2022, he would be 86, and friends say that his 2016 campaign was almost certainly his last.But colleagues see a shift since his diagnosis.\u201cDo I hear in his voice a little bit more expression of grander ideals? I do,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cWith all that\u2019s happened to him, and the knowledge of where he is, I sense a little bit more of that.\u201dIn Philadelphia, the National Constitution Center awarded Mr. McCain its Liberty Medal, honoring his lifetime of public service. The senator\u2019s acceptance speech was a treatise on his expansive view of America\u2019s role in the world \u2014 a role that, he fears, is being diminished by Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201cThe international order we helped build from the ashes of world war, and that we defend to this day, has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history,\u201d Mr. McCain said.He went on to deplore as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d those who would \u201cabandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe,\u201d in favor of \u201csome half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.\u201dThe speech grew out of a book Mr. McCain is writing with Mark Salter, his longtime speechwriter and co-author. It was not aimed directly at Mr. Trump, Mr. Salter said, but at the philosophy of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, and his hard-charging right-wing website, Breitbart News.\u201cIn my view, and McCain\u2019s too, these guys at Breitbart are crackpots,\u201d Mr. Salter said.Another element of the speech \u2014 Mr. McCain\u2019s gratitude for a life well lived \u2014 was equally important to the senator, Mr. Salter added, but it got lost in the media frenzy around the address.Mr. Biden said he took the speech as a pointed message, if not to Mr. Trump, then to the nation. \u201cI think he was delivering a message to the country, to his colleagues and to any of the opinion makers that would listen, and that is, \u2018Look, this is serious stuff, our role in the world is not guaranteed, democracy is not guaranteed, we know how to do this and, damn it, we\u2019d better focus and know what\u2019s at stake.\u2019\u201dThe president, though, took it personally.\u201cPeople have to be careful, because at some point, I fight back,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m being nice. I\u2019m being very, very nice. But at some point, I fight back, and it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201dTo which Mr. McCain, a former Navy captain who was tortured during more than five years as a prisoner in Vietnam, shot back: \u201cI have faced tougher adversaries.\u201dMr. Biden found the tit-for-tat laughable. \u201cThe idea that Trump is going to intimidate John McCain? Give me a break,\u201d he said.Now, \u201cthere\u2019s not a relationship\u201d between the two men, said John Weaver, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McCain. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they had one that got soured, or they had one that has not improved. There is not one.\u201dIn a brief hallway conversation in a Capitol corridor this past week, Mr. McCain put it this way: \u201cI\u2019m doing what I think is right for the country. I don\u2019t work for Donald Trump, and I don\u2019t work for his administration.\u201dHe has turned his tongue on his colleagues as well. In July, in a dramatic return to Congress after surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye, he delivered a harsh critique of the Senate as he called for Democrats and Republicans to work together.\u201cWe\u2019ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues, because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle,\u201d Mr. McCain said.That speech was \u201cthe kind of speech one gives when they\u2019re leaving,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who has served for decades in the Senate with Mr. McCain. \u201cI think in many ways it was a catharsis for him, and I think that he doesn\u2019t know how much longer he has. I hope he has a long, long time. But I think he\u2019s decided, I\u2019m going to make every moment count.\u201dIf Mr. McCain views himself as a guardian of the Senate as an institution, it is perhaps because he practically grew up in the chamber.In 1977, four years after his release from the Vietnamese prison known as the Hanoi Hilton, the Navy assigned Mr. McCain to be its Senate liaison. He traveled around the world with lawmakers \u2014 including Mr. Biden, then a senator from Delaware \u2014 arranging their schedules and sometimes even carting their luggage.The reaction to his health care vote \u201csurprised him,\u201d Mr. Biden said, \u201chow much impact it had in giving courage to others of his own party.\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s speaking out on much broader issues,\u201d she said.As he walks the halls of the Capitol, often surrounded by reporters \u2014 he once famously referred to the news media as \u201cmy base\u201d \u2014 Mr. McCain is his usual irreverent, prickly self. To a reporter who missed his speech in July, he said wryly: \u201cIt was one of the great speeches ever given. People thought about William Jennings Bryan when they saw that speech.\u201dWhen a Fox News correspondent asked if he would oppose everything Mr. Trump asked him to do, the senator snapped, \u201cWhy would you say something that stupid?\u201dAsk how he is feeling, and he will issue a brusque reply \u2014 \u201cfine, fine, I\u2019m fine\u201d \u2014 before brushing aside further inquiry. But he has grown thinner in recent weeks, and sometimes looks fatigued. Those who know him well see the cancer treatment wearing on him. He is characteristically matter-of-fact about the future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies? Don\u2019t Bet on It", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. They\u2019re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won\u2019t.The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives \u2014 when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms \u2014 Americans turned to their government for a fix.Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants\u2019 power through government \u2014 and, if so, how.On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five \u2014 Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.But there is little to suggest we\u2019ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants\u2019 vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.\u201cIndividuals, lawmakers, we\u2019re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable \u2014 so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.\u201cOur firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cFolks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I\u2019d bet a lot of money a year from now we\u2019ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.\u201dPart of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we\u2019ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They\u2019re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five\u2019s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.\u201cWe\u2019ve all become a bit cyborg,\u201d writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d one of several new books examining the giants. \u201cWhat we need to always remember is that we\u2019re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.\u201dYet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it\u2019s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn\u2019t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn\u2019t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government\u2019s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company\u2019s culture \u2014 which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today\u2019s tech giants. But that\u2019s a big if.\u201cThe big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cHad we been more diligent, we wouldn\u2019t have nearly the problems we have today.\u201dFollow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Fiction Becomes Fact on Social Media", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMindHours after the Las Vegas massacre, Travis McKinney\u2019s Facebook feed was hit with a scattershot of conspiracy theories. The police were lying. There were multiple shooters in the hotel, not just one. The sheriff was covering for casino owners to preserve their business.The political rumors sprouted soon after, like digital weeds. The killer was anti-Trump, an \u201cantifa\u201d activist, said some; others made the opposite claim, that he was an alt-right terrorist. The two unsupported narratives ran into the usual stream of chatter, news and selfies.\u201cThis stuff was coming in from all over my network of 300 to 400\u201d friends and followers, said Mr. McKinney, 52, of Suffolk, Va., and some posts were from his inner circle.But he knew there was only one shooter; a handgun instructor and defense contractor, he had been listening to the police scanner in Las Vegas with an app. \u201cI jumped online and tried to counter some of this nonsense,\u201d he said.Agents with links to the Russian government set up an endless array of fake accounts and websites and purchased a slew of advertisements on Google and Facebook, spreading dubious claims that seemed intended to sow division all along the political spectrum \u2014 \u201ca cultural hack,\u201d in the words of one expert.Yet the psychology behind social media platforms \u2014 the dynamics that make them such powerful vectors of misinformation in the first place \u2014 is at least as important, experts say, especially for those who think they\u2019re immune to being duped. For all the suspicions about social media companies\u2019 motives and ethics, it is the interaction of the technology with our common, often subconscious psychological biases that makes so many of us vulnerable to misinformation, and this has largely escaped notice.Skepticism of online \u201cnews\u201d serves as a decent filter much of the time, but our innate biases allow it to be bypassed, researchers have found \u2014 especially when presented with the right kind of algorithmically selected \u201cmeme.\u201dAt a time when political misinformation is in ready supply, and in demand, \u201cFacebook, Google, and Twitter function as a distribution mechanism, a platform for circulating false information and helping find receptive audiences,\u201d said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College (and occasional contributor to The Times\u2019s Upshot column).For starters, said Colleen Seifert, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, \u201cPeople have a benevolent view of Facebook, for instance, as a curator, but in fact it does have a motive of its own. What it\u2019s actually doing is keeping your eyes on the site. It\u2019s curating news and information that will keep you watching.\u201dThat kind of curating acts as a fertile host for falsehoods by simultaneously engaging two predigital social-science standbys: the urban myth as \u201cmeme,\u201d or viral idea; and individual biases, the automatic, subconscious presumptions that color belief.The first process is largely data-driven, experts said, and built into social media algorithms. The wide circulation of bizarre, easily debunked rumors \u2014 so-called Pizzagate, for example, the canard that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from a Washington-area pizza parlor \u2014 is not entirely dependent on partisan fever (though that was its origin).For one, the common wisdom that these rumors gain circulation because most people conduct their digital lives in echo chambers or \u201cinformation cocoons\u201d is exaggerated, Dr. Nyhan said.In a forthcoming paper, Dr. Nyhan and colleagues review the relevant research, including analyses of partisan online news sites and Nielsen data, and find the opposite. Most people are more omnivorous than presumed; they are not confined in warm bubbles containing only agreeable outrage.But they don\u2019t have to be for fake news to spread fast, research also suggests. Social media algorithms function at one level like evolutionary selection: Most lies and false rumors go nowhere, but the rare ones with appealing urban-myth \u201cmutations\u201d find psychological traction, then go viral.There is no precise formula for such digital catnip. The point, experts said, is that the very absurdity of the Pizzagate lie could have boosted its early prominence, no matter the politics of those who shared it.\u201cMy experience is that once this stuff gets going, people just pass these stories on without even necessarily stopping to read them,\u201d Mr. McKinney said. \u201cThey\u2019re just participating in the conversation without stopping to look hard\u201d at the source.Digital social networks are \u201cdangerously effective at identifying memes that are well adapted to surviving, and these also tend to be the rumors and conspiracy theories that are hardest to correct,\u201d Dr. Nyhan said.One reason is the raw pace of digital information sharing, he said: \u201cThe networks make information run so fast that it outruns fact-checkers\u2019 ability to check it. Misinformation spreads widely before it can be downgraded in the algorithms.\u201dThe authors analyzed the news feeds of some 10 million users in the United States who posted their political views, and concluded that \u201cindividuals\u2019 choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure\u201d to contrary news and commentary than Facebook\u2019s own algorithmic ranking \u2014 which gauges how interesting stories are likely to be to individual users, based on data they have provided.Outside critics lashed the study as self-serving, while other researchers said the analysis was solid and without apparent bias.The other dynamic that works in favor of proliferating misinformation is not embedded in the software but in the biological hardware: the cognitive biases of the human brain.Purely from a psychological point of view, subtle individual biases are at least as important as rankings and choice when it comes to spreading bogus news or Russian hoaxes \u2014 like a false report of Muslim men in Michigan collecting welfare for multiple wives.Merely understanding what a news report or commentary is saying requires a temporary suspension of disbelief. Mentally, the reader must temporarily accept the stated \u201cfacts\u201d as possibly true. A cognitive connection is made automatically: Clinton-sex offender, Trump-Nazi, Muslim men-welfare.And refuting those false claims requires a person to first mentally articulate them, reinforcing a subconscious connection that lingers far longer than people presume.Over time, for many people, it is that false initial connection that stays the strongest, not the retractions or corrections: \u201cWas Obama a Muslim? I seem to remember that....\u201dIn a recent analysis of the biases that help spread misinformation, Dr. Seifert and co-authors named this and several other automatic cognitive connections that can buttress false information.Another is repetition: Merely seeing a news headline multiple times in a news feed makes it seem more credible before it is ever read carefully, even if it\u2019s a fake item being whipped around by friends as a joke.\u201cYour social alliances affect how you weight information,\u201d said Dr. Seifert. \u201cWe overweight information from people we know.\u201dThe casual, social, wisecracking nature of thumbing through and participating in the digital exchanges allows these biases to operate all but unchecked, Dr. Seifert said.Stopping to drill down and determine the true source of a foul-smelling story can be tricky, even for the motivated skeptic, and mentally it\u2019s hard work. Ideological leanings and viewing choices are conscious, downstream factors that come into play only after automatic cognitive biases have already had their way, abetted by the algorithms and social nature of digital interactions.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have direct evidence that all these theories were wrong\u201d from the scanner, Mr. McKinney said, \u201cI might have taken them a little more seriously.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These publications often are called predatory journals, on the assumption that well-meaning academics are duped into working with them \u2014 tricked by flattering emails from the journals inviting them to submit a paper or fooled by a name that sounded like a journal they knew.Many faculty members \u2014 especially at schools where the teaching load is heavy and resources few \u2014 have become eager participants in what experts call academic fraud that wastes taxpayer money, chips away at scientific credibility, and muddies important research.Predatory journals have few expenses, since they do not seriously review papers that are submitted and they publish only online. They blast emails to academics, inviting them to publish. And the journals often advertise on their websites that they are indexed by Google Scholar. Often that is correct \u2014 but Google Scholar does not vet the journals it indexes.The journals are giving rise to a wider ecosystem of pseudo science. For the academic who wants to add credentials to a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, for instance, publishers also hold meetings where, for a hefty fee, you can be listed as a presenter \u2014 whether you actually attend the meeting or not.But when I visited, the only venue was a small windowless room on the sixth floor of a hotel undergoing renovation. A handful of people sat in the room, diligently listening to a talk. Most who were listed on the program were not in attendance.Academics get rewarded with promotions when they stuff their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with articles like these, Dr. Pyne concluded. There are few or no adverse consequences \u2014 in fact, the rewards for publishing in predatory journals were greater than for publishing in legitimate ones.Dr. Pyne does not know what role those studies played in the promotions. But, he said, \u201cI can say that such publications do not seem to hurt promotion prospects.\u201dTensions over this kind of scholarship have spilled over Queensborough Community College, part of CUNY, the City University of New York.Although it is hardly known for its research, college administrators urge the faculty to publish. Recently a group of concerned professors complained that nearly a dozen colleagues have repeatedly published in at least one of the dubious journals \u2014 and have been promoted and rewarded for it.Noting that a number of these papers apparently depended on federal and city funds, the professors brought the matter to the attention of the vice chancellor for research and even wrote to the New York State inspector general\u2019s office.The school referred inquiries to its head librarian, Jeanne Galvin.\u201cJust as with many colleges, faculty submit their work for publication in a variety of journals based on individual judgment,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cQueensborough offers several advisory resources, such as workshops and individual consultation with expert librarians. The research that I have seen published by our faculty is of the highest quality.\u201dSome say the academic system bears much of the blame for the rise of predatory journals, demanding publications even from teachers at places without real resources for research and where they may have little time apart from teaching.At Queensborough, faculty members typically teach nine courses per year. At four-year colleges, faculty may teach four to six courses a year.Yet \u201cevery university requires some level of publication,\u201d said Lawrence DiPaolo, vice president of academic affairs at Neumann University in Aston, Pa.Recently a group of researchers invented a fake academic: Anna O. Szust. The name in Polish means fraudster. Dr. Szust applied to legitimate and predatory journals asking to be an editor. She supplied a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in which her publications and degrees were total fabrications, as were the names of the publishers of the books she said she had contributed to.The legitimate journals rejected her application immediately. But 48 out of 360 questionable journals made her an editor. Four made her editor in chief. One journal sent her an email saying, \u201cIt\u2019s our pleasure to add your name as our editor in chief for the journal with no responsibilities.\u201dThe lead author of the Dr. Szust sting operation, Katarzyna Pisanski, a psychologist at the University of Sussex in England, said the question of what motivates people to publish in such journals \u201cis a touchy subject.\u201d\u201cIf you were tricked by spam email you might not want to admit it, and if you did it wittingly to increase your publication counts you might also not want to admit it,\u201d she said in an email.The consequences of participating can be more than just a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 freckled with poor-quality papers and meeting abstracts. Publications become part of the body of scientific literature.There are indications that some academic institutions are beginning to wise up to the dangers.Dewayne Fox, an associate professor of fisheries at Delaware State University, sits on a committee at his school that reviews job applicants. One recent applicant, he recalled, listed 50 publications in such journals and is on the editorial boards of some of them.A few years ago, he said, no one would have noticed. But now he and others on search committees at his university have begun scrutinizing the publications closely to see if the journals are legitimate.\u201cIf something gets published in one of these journals and it\u2019s complete garbage, it can develop a life of its own,\u201d Dr. Fox said.\u201cThink about human medicine and how much is on the line. When people publish something that is not replicable, it can have health impacts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What if Platforms Like Facebook Are Too Big to Regulate?", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyBut in larger markets with bigger taxi companies, municipal governments bristle at the company\u2019s deep, evident disdain for their authority \u2014 and they\u2019re capable of striking back. Last month, in a sudden show of force, London told Uber that its license to operate in the city wouldn\u2019t be renewed. The city\u2019s transit authority cited a number of reasons for its actions: Uber\u2019s approach to reporting crimes; its background-check policies; its aggressive attempts to thwart regulators; general appeals to \u201cpublic safety\u201d and \u201ccorporate responsibility.\u201dLondon\u2019s threat to Uber is clearly existential: Being shut out of one of its largest markets is terrible for business and sets a dangerous precedent for the company as it tries to expand around the globe. But governments similarly perceive, in Uber, a broader challenge to their legitimacy. Uber doesn\u2019t so much do business in cities as unilaterally install itself as infrastructure. Its incompatibilities with local regulations or national employment law are presented as neither features nor bugs but as evidence of evolution and progress. It identifies, vets and credentials drivers. It fields complaints and arbitrates disputes, exercising authority over those it deems bad actors. It lets riders rate drivers and vice versa, creating a sort of customer-service-centric accountability. Because Uber purports to be self-regulating, its users and drivers share in the company\u2019s feeling that outside interference is unwelcome and even unnatural. It now has a constituency, hundreds of thousands strong, angry with their government on behalf of a corporation.Facebook had recently disclosed that it believed Russian state actors purchased political ads during the 2016 election; more broadly, it had been accused of allowing disinformation and misinformation to thrive on its platform. Among the measures that Zuckerberg said his company would take included expanding \u201cpartnerships\u201d with election commissions around the world and \u201cworking proactively to strengthen the democratic process.\u201d Most striking, coming from the C.E.O. of a publicly traded American social-media company, was this line: \u201cWe have been working to ensure the integrity of the German elections this weekend.\u201dSocial-media companies aren\u2019t new to defending themselves in ideological terms \u2014 they\u2019re just not used to doing it on their home turf. While to authoritarian regimes, the threat of social media is obvious, in the United States, Facebook, Twitter and Google have for years talked about themselves freely in the language of democracy, participation and connectivity. The emerging tension between internet platforms and democratic governments, however, seems to stem less from their obvious rhetorical differences than from their similarities.The problem was that Facebook had outgrown every context except its own. Though it neither thinks like nor resembles a government, it has effectively sewn itself into the fabric of users\u2019 public and personal lives. Facebook accounts have now become something like IDs, enabling an ever-growing range of activities: commerce, job-seeking, leisure. Networks stand in for community; encryption, in owned and operated services like WhatsApp, stands in for guarantees of liberty; newsfeeds become sources of diverse information, including ads, yes, but also calls to register to vote \u2014 to apply elsewhere what you\u2019ve increasingly experienced online.It\u2019s very likely that any approach to regulating Facebook will look more like diplomacy than anything else \u2014 a cautious search for d\u00e9tente with an institution that ultimately gets to set its own laws, whether a government likes it or not. Indeed, the company has been presenting itself as a willing, generous participant in American investigations, but more generally as a supranational, self-regulating force for good, and, boldly, as indispensable for the continuation of democracy around the world. \u201cWe will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world,\u201d Zuckerberg said, \u201cbut also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere.\u201d For citizen users, it\u2019s a gesture of good faith. To skeptical countries, it\u2019s a gentle declaration of independence, or maybe a dare. For Facebook, it\u2019s something distinct, new and unmistakably statelike: a claim of sovereignty.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.K. Lawmakers Ask Facebook About Russian Influence in Brexit Vote", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Parliament is asking Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies for information about Russian efforts to use social media to influence the British vote to leave the European Union, expanding on several parallel American congressional investigations around the election of President Trump.The British inquiry adds to the mounting pressure for more disclosure from the internet giants, which have already acknowledged broad Russian efforts to influence national elections in both the United States and France.Any indication of Russian meddling in the British vote last year to leave the European Union could raise doubts about the integrity of the outcome, further complicating the already vexed domestic politics surrounding the departure, commonly called Brexit.The Kremlin, which has long viewed the European Union as a threat, had a strong interest in promoting the groups that favored Britain\u2019s leaving the bloc. And the most visible tools of Russian propaganda, like the English-language broadcaster RT and the news agency Sputnik, heavily supported the initiative. The leave camp won with 52 percent of ballots cast, about 1.3 million more votes than the remain side drew.\u201cAny interference in the democratic process of the United Kingdom by people acting illegitimately is a serious matter,\u201d Damian Collins, a Conservative who heads a parliamentary committee leading an inquiry into \u201cfake news,\u201d wrote in a letter released on Tuesday that requested information from Twitter.A spokesman for Facebook said the company would respond \u201conce we have had the opportunity to review the request.\u201dA spokesman for Twitter declined to comment, but said in an email that the company was adapting to \u201cpatterns of malicious activity\u201d and now catches more than 3.2 million suspicious accounts each week. The company says that is more than twice what it detected each week last year, in the period before the Brexit referendum. It was unclear how much of that difference was attributable to better detection and how much to a growing number of suspect accounts.Facebook has acknowledged that Russian agents covertly bought advertising on its platform in an effort to swing the 2016 presidential election in favor of Mr. Trump. The company said in September that it was turning over more than 3,000 Russian-linked ads to congressional committees investigating interference in the race. Some of the Russian-linked content sought to influence the election obliquely, by inflaming social issues or racial tensions.\u201cIt is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation-states attempting to subvert elections,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are committed to rising to the occasion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The juxtapositions can be bracing, like \u201cKyrie eleison\u201d (\u201cLord have mercy\u201d) followed by the brutal line \u201cLet the strongest live and the weakest die.\u201dThe piece may sound like Renaissance polyphony, but its score also nods to modern science, transcribing the DNA of Darwin\u2019s finches for the opening melody, for example, and adapting into musical variations genetic concepts like insertion, mutation and deletion.\u201cThere\u2019s this exploration of the edges of things,\u201d Gregory Brown said in an interview in Boston. \u201cWhether that edge is science and music, or religious and scientific, or sacred and secular.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Dan Brown said that he\u2019s \u201calways looking for big themes,\u201d and when he first heard the mass performed in 2011 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., \u201cit got me thinking about creationism and this sort of battle between science and religion.\u201dHe followed the idea until it became \u201cOrigin,\u201d a thriller \u2014 starring his signature protagonist, the Harvard \u201csymbologist\u201d Robert Langdon \u2014 about a brazen scientist whose discovery about the source of life on Earth and the future of humanity threatens to upend the world\u2019s religious order.\u201cMissa Charles Darwin\u201d appears late in the book, after a wild night for Langdon that begins with a clandestine encounter inside a Richard Serra sculpture and ends at a computing center that holds the key to life\u2019s origins. He enters the center and hears Gregory\u2019s \u201cChristian-style mass,\u201d in which devout voices take their place alongside a celebration of natural selection.\u201cThis piece of art that fuses science and religion and makes them beautiful \u2014 I thought at that point in the novel, it was just this moment when you needed to rest and see that these two can intertwine,\u201d Dan Brown said.Spirituality and science often did overlap as the Brown brothers grew up. Their father, a math teacher, was an Escher obsessive who told them folk stories about clever mathematicians, and they turned pages for their mother, a church organist who provided Gregory\u2019s first exposure to sacred music. He, in turn, began college as an aspiring scientist, and traveled to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, where he was awe-struck by a vermilion flycatcher and Lonesome George, the last known tortoise of his species.\u201cYou get the sense that it hasn\u2019t changed much since Darwin was there,\u201d he said.Studying geology also gave him a sense of the planet\u2019s long, slow timeline. He ended up with \u201cthis feeling about time and our place on Earth that I\u2019d never had before,\u201d he said, which works its way into the \u201cCredo\u201d movement of \u201cMissa Charles Darwin.\u201dCraig Phillips, the group\u2019s bass, first had the idea for \u201cMissa Charles Darwin\u201d and said he was inspired by \u201cjust how beautiful, lyrical and poetic\u201d the prose is in \u201cOn the Origin of Species.\u201dMr. Phillips culled the text from Darwin\u2019s writings. \u201cIt\u2019s almost built for a musical setting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so lofty and majestic.\u201dDan Brown didn\u2019t tell his brother that the mass had made its way into \u201cOrigin\u201d until he finished writing the chapter. He said that when he asked Gregory to give it a read \u2014 they are often sounding boards for each other \u2014 \u201che came back sort of wide-eyed.\u201dGregory gave his blessing, with a slight correction to how the music was described.

{"Headline": "N.F.L. Players May Have an Ally in Their Protests: Labor Law", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs National Football League team owners consider President Trump\u2019s call to fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, they have stumbled into one of the most consequential debates in today\u2019s workplace: How far can workers go in banding together to address problems related to their employment?In principle, the answer in the N.F.L. and elsewhere may be: Quite far.To the extent that most people think about the reach of federal labor law, they probably imagine a union context \u2014 like organizing workers, or bargaining as a group across the table from management.As it happens, the law is much more expansive, protecting any \u201cconcerted activities\u201d that employees engage in to support one another in the workplace, whether or not a union is involved. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have defined such activity to include everything from airing complaints about one\u2019s boss through social media to publicly supporting political causes that have some bearing on one\u2019s work life.The league\u2019s operations manual says players must be on the sidelines during the anthem and should stand. While the law might not bear on whether an individual player can kneel during the anthem, many experts say it could protect players from repercussions for making such a gesture together \u2014 or taking other action \u2014 to show solidarity on the job.And as unionization continues its decades-long decline, some believe that these alternative forms of taking collective action may be crucial to enabling workers to speak up.\u201cWorkers without a traditional organization that is meant to protect them at work are kind of scrambling around for new ways of protecting themselves,\u201d said Benjamin Sachs, a labor law professor at Harvard University. \u201cIt does feel like these are nascent forms of something new.\u201dTo be protected under federal labor law, an employee\u2019s action must be conducted in concert with co-workers, it must address an issue of relevance to their job, and it must be carried out using appropriate means. Workers can\u2019t, say, damage property or threaten violence. (If the workers have a collective bargaining agreement with their employer that forbids certain actions \u2014 like striking \u2014 they can\u2019t do that, either.)Many experts believe that some of the recent protests by N.F.L. players meet all three conditions, and that as a result, their teams cannot discipline or fire them for taking part.More recently, the Obama-era labor board appeared to bless a relatively informal definition of the term \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d so that spontaneous banter, and not just well-orchestrated action like a formal protest, could qualify as protected.Together, said Matthew Bodie, a law professor at St. Louis University who is a former attorney for the labor board, these precedents suggest that federal labor law would most likely protect collective protests of the president\u2019s argument that players should be fired over political gestures \u2014 or his suggestion that league rules designed to protect players from debilitating injury are too strict.Mr. Bodie added that a player was also likely to enjoy federal protection for any protest in support of other players who had been disciplined.\u201cIf they\u2019re standing up for other players\u2019 rights to kneel in the context of their job and keep their job, it seems to me to be protected concerted activity,\u201d Mr. Bodie said.Michael J. Lotito, a lawyer with the management-side firm Littler Mendelson, agreed that players who protested Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to stifle their colleagues\u2019 political gestures could be engaging in protected activity. But he argued that under the law, which he said the Obama-era labor board had interpreted too broadly, the activity would have to entail more than kneeling during the national anthem.He said players would need a more overt connection to their cause, like passing out, to other players, fliers that took issue with the president\u2019s meddling in their workplace.Mr. Lotito also said the players\u2019 collective bargaining agreement with the owners could lawfully prohibit these sorts of protests. But Michael LeRoy, who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois, said the league\u2019s bargaining agreement was somewhat ambiguous on the question of protests with a political dimension.The N.F.L. and its players association did not respond to requests for comment.Experts said the \u201cconcerted activity\u201d right could be even more profound in workplaces, unlike the N.F.L., where employees aren\u2019t unionized and, therefore, have fewer tools for challenging their employers.\u201cPeople naturally have complaints, and they don\u2019t go away just because you kill unions,\u201d said Wilma B. Liebman, a former chairwoman of the labor board during the Obama administration.With a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and a Republican majority on the labor board, federal law is likely to move in this direction.Even so, there is probably no reversing the trend of employees\u2019 piping up en masse in the workplace. \u201cPeople\u2019s instinct, whether you know the word \u2018solidarity\u2019 or not, is to look for people to join you,\u201d said Ms. Liebman, the former board chairman. \u201cThe growth of social media, Twitter, different avenues for expressing solidarity, is kind of remarkable.\u201dKen Belson and Adam Liptak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Rarely, however, are they placed on every seat. And they are never black hooded plastic rain ponchos, with the name of a designer across the back.Such was the case at Rick Owens on Thursday evening. For his eerie, water-soaked show at the Palais du Tokyo, overlooking the banks of the Seine, models dressed in strange silhouettes that resembled alien cocoons and took a trip through fountain mists. The seated audience, bedecked in their ponchos, looked like they were taking a different kind of ride: a high fashion log flume, perhaps, as they were showered from on high.Five days later, inside the Grand Palais, the elements emerged again, this time at Chanel. Karl Lagerfeld had commissioned a giant replica of the Verdon Gorge in the south of France, which took two months to construct and had six waterfalls, all rushing into a gully below the catwalk. The aquatic theme then continued with the collection, a playful 89-look procession of vinyl rain gear.

The French brand, now designed by Anthony Vaccarello, opened up Paris Fashion Week in the most beautiful place imaginable: at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Showgoers sat on a set at the base of the Trocadero, and as models emerged, the Eiffel Tower glittered as if on cue. With such an impressive backdrop, the fashion needed to be powerful, and it was. For the show\u2019s finale, couture-like feather and leather gowns came down the runway, one more beautiful than the next. \u2014 MALINA JOSEPH GILCHRIST, style director, women\u2019s, T magazineIn a season in which casting directors appeared at last to be inching toward diversity and inclusivity on the runway \u2014 with leaps and bounds still to go \u2014 I was most struck by the omnipresence of the beautiful redhead Teddy Quinlivan. She\u2019s been a familiar face for several seasons, but during this one, midway during New York Fashion Week, she came out as transgender. And in a rare cheering moment, the reaction was first celebratory (it was a brave revelation) and then resolutely normal.Then she resumed her career without incident and swept the shows in Paris \u2014 Dior, Dries, Margiela, Chlo\u00e9, Paco Rabanne, Haider Ackermann, Sacai, Miu Miu, Louis Vuitton \u2014 not as a token or an example, just another woman with a great look and sixth sense about how to mow down a catwalk. Sometimes, progress comes with a shout. Other times, no less worthy, with a shrug. \u2014 MATTHEW SCHNEIER, deputy fashion critic and reporter, StylesOne of the characteristics of shows in Paris is the way they exploit (and reveal) fashion\u2019s relationship to the city. Designers here don\u2019t opt for soulless white boxes but instead race to outdo each other in access to the coolest, rarest, most insider venues. This season, there were shows in the Invalides (Napoleon\u2019s Tomb), the Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e Picasso, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin and the gilt environs of City Hall (to name a few). It was like Fodor\u2019s, but with better clothes.Even in such vaunted company, however, two spaces stood out, in part because they aren\u2019t included in any tourist handbook. The first was the Palais de Justice, the complex that houses the French equivalent of the supreme court, where Clare Waight Keller\u2019s debut for Givenchy was held; the second the Russian embassy, where Comme des Gar\u00e7ons unveiled its collection. Neither institution had ever hosted a fashion show before, so it was everyone\u2019s first time. \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMAN, fashion director, StylesSee the full collectionWhat will the future of fashion look like? On Monday evening many in the industry gathered at the headquarters of Google on the Rue de Londres to find out.In theory, they turned out to support Miroslava Duma at the official opening party for Fashion Tech Lab, her incubator, investment fund and philanthropic organization targeting new technologies. In practice, on the penultimate night of Paris Fashion Week, they also came to drink Champagne.\u201cThis industry is waking up to the fact it can\u2019t ignore innovation in the field anymore,\u201d said Ms. Duma, surrounded by friends like Stella McCartney, Demna Gvasalia, Antoine Arnault and Maria Grazia Chiuri. \u201cMore and more brands have now realized that they need to embrace innovation, particularly when it comes to sustainability. The future is coming, whether we like it or not.\u201dTo prove her point, a series of installations were on show for guests to see what could come next. Threads made from spider silk, upcycled yarn, stem-cell-engineered leather and diamonds sourced from above the ground elicited both curiosity and Instagram posts, as did a robotic barman, pouring mojitos ordered via tablets, much to the excitement of the crowd. \u2014 E.P.Among all the big shows of the week, it\u2019s is the small ones that sometimes have the most impact. Such was the case with the return of Andre Walker to Paris Fashion Week. The veteran New York designer staged a presentation on the stairs of Les Arts Decoratifs, where he showed a collection of clothing he originally designed between 1982 and 1986. The patterns were reconstituted from the original patterns, and three decades later seemed surprisingly au courant. There were blanket jackets (a collaboration with Pendleton) with beautiful cut sleeves, wrap skirts and dresses with folds. The mix of men\u2019s and women\u2019s looks signaled not only where Mr. Walker is coming from, but also where he\u2019s going. \u2014 M.J.G.The vertigo you get snapping between the actual world and the fashion world during the monthlong sabbatical from reality known fashion month can be intense. A terror attack in London, destruction in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Texas, hurricanes and flooding, a mass shooting in Las Vegas \u2014 meanwhile, frocks.But the news creeps in, even to fashion. At Balenciaga, Demna Gvasalia worked up newspaper prints. They\u2019ve been around in fashion before \u2014 remember John Galliano\u2019s famous newsprint dress for Dior? \u2014 but Mr. Gvasalia scrambled the script, filling his column inches with gibberish dummy copy and photos only of happy people. \u201cI wanted happy news,\u201d he said backstage. It\u2019s a pipe dream: fake news. But still, you could dare to dream, if only for a minute. \u2014 M.S.The Undercover designer Jun Takahashi is one of the great showman working in fashion. Staged at the 19th-century Le Grand Hotel in Paris, his show began with pairs of models who walked side by side, hand in hand under a spotlight.Each couple wore looks that spoke to each another in some way: two identically cut V-neck shifts, one in T-shirt material printed with Cindy Sherman\u2019s face, and the other made from scarlet red silk covered in embroidered sequin cats. Others wore voluminous short-sleeve track suits; matching brooches in monogram-style letters; and what were made to look like pearl earrings, but dramatically oversize and partially crushed, resembling dented Ping-Pong balls.Mr. Takahashi created 32 looks like these before closing the show with five sets of real identical twins, dressed in matching blue and white Peter Pan dresses inspired by the Grady twins in the 1980 horror film \u201cThe Shining.\u201d The complexity of finding, and casting, so many pairs of twin sisters was a serious feat, echoing one of Mr. Takahashi\u2019s collections from over a decade before, for spring 2004, in which he also sent identical twins down the catwalk. \u2014 Alexa Brazilian, fashion features director, T magazineAt the end of more than three weeks of fashion shows in different cities, the last day of Paris Fashion Week often brings with it a bunch of tired, overstimulated fashion editors waiting for sundown. However, at Moncler Gamme Rouge, weary faces brightened with smiles as Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cShape of You\u201d began to play, spotlights made giant disco balls glimmer, and a troupe of American \u201chiplet\u201d ballerinas emerged in a conga line dancing to the beat en pointe.The dance company was formed by the 66-year-old Chicago choreographer Homer Hans Bryant, whose fusion of traditional ballet and hip-hop has sent the internet aflutter. The girls performed in vignettes peppered throughout the regular run of show, for which the designer Giambattista Valli clad models in cozy heather gray \u201cFlashdance\u201d-style leg warmers, diaphanous white lace dresses and red, white and blue iterations of the French brand\u2019s signature puffer. For the finale, the dancers high-stepped their way off the stage to the sounds of the Florida duo Black Violin, who, fittingly, mix hip-hop with classical violin and viola. \u2014 A.B.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Russian agents intending to sow discord among American citizens disseminated inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google\u2019s YouTube service, according to copies of prepared remarks from the companies that were obtained by The New York Times.The detailed disclosures, sent to Congress on Monday by companies whose products are among the most widely used on the internet, came before a series of congressional hearings this week into how third parties used social networks and online services to influence millions of Americans before the 2016 presidential election.In its prepared remarks sent to Congress, Facebook said the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin, had posted roughly 80,000 pieces of divisive content that was shown to about 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017. Those posts were then liked, shared and followed by others, spreading the messages to tens of millions more people. Facebook also said it had found and deleted more than 170 accounts on its photo-sharing app Instagram; those accounts had posted about 120,000 pieces of Russia-linked content.Facebook, Mr. Stretch said, was \u201cdetermined to prevent it from happening again.\u201dThe new information also illuminated when Facebook knew there had been Russian interference on its platform. Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations.Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users\u2019 News Feeds everyday. Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook.Twitter, in its prepared remarks, said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts on its service that were linked to the Internet Research Agency between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts, which Twitter has suspended, posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period.Outside of the activity of the Internet Research Agency, Twitter identified more than 36,000 automated accounts that posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that three-month period. The tweets received approximately 288 million views, according to the company\u2019s remarks.Twitter noted that the 1.4 million Russia-linked election tweets represented less than three-quarters of one percent of all election-related tweets during that period.Google, in its prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria.Google said it had found 18 channels that were \u201clikely associated\u201d with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube. All told, those accounts \u2014 now suspended \u2014 uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017. Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts that added up to 309,000 views between the middle of 2015 and late 2016. Only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers, the company said.Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those were not related to the Kremlin.\u201cWhile we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable,\u201d wrote Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel. The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity \u2014 or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such \u2014 as a reason for taking down the accounts.Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill. Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network.The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures. Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate. The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year.Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads. The company is working to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Google\u2019s AdWords \u2014 for example, web search ads \u2014 and YouTube. Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad.Mike Isaac reported from Washington and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bowing to the Inevitable, Advertisers Embrace Advocate Role", "Date": "2017-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, advertisers have striven to stay away from any topic that might prove controversial or divisive. Times have changed.That was a recurring theme during the recently concluded Advertising Week New York, an annual industry conference in Manhattan that has turned into its own global enterprise. (Next year, regional versions of the event will be held in Mexico City, London, Tokyo and Sydney.)The responsibility of companies, particularly advertisers, to advocate on social issues and to provide a moral compass in a fraught political environment came up repeatedly during the week.While appearing on a panel of chief executives discussing diversity and inclusion, J. Clifford Hudson, the chief executive of Sonic Drive-In, which franchises its restaurants and is based in Oklahoma City, said he has been stymied on how public to be about efforts made within his company after a report last year showed that more Sonic customers associated with President Trump than any other presidential candidate. That was \u201cto my surprise,\u201d he said, \u201cwith believe me, no effort on our part whatsoever.\u201dMr. Hudson said he was proud that most of his senior team is made up of either women or ethnic minorities but he has wondered, \u201cDo I do that quietly or do I become more public about it?\u201d He added, \u201cThe for-profit private sector is going to be playing a stronger role in the next number of years at trying to reset the bar, for fear that the bar shifts in such a way that it\u2019s not healthy for society.\u201dA separate panel focused on the representation of women in commercials and highlighted recent research from the advertising company J. Walter Thompson New York and the Geena Davis Institute that showed men get far more screen time in ads compared with women, who are less likely to be depicted as funny or even employed.\u201cPeople don\u2019t trust government and big authorities, they\u2019re looking for companies to take courageous stands and really do more good in the world,\u201d said Debra Bass, president of global marketing services at Johnson & Johnson Consumer. \u201cWe know advertising creates stereotypes which shape culture and it\u2019s our responsibility to change culture so more women will have education and economic empowerment and less abuse.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in an environment where, wherever you stand on the political spectrum, I think it\u2019s clear to all of us right now that we\u2019re looking to actors outside of our government to help drive the social justice agenda,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. \u201cTo be part of an organization like ours and in this partnership with the N.F.L. is allowing us to start to do that.\u201dBoth companies have been smarting lately. Major brands like AT&T and Coca-Cola pulled ads from YouTube earlier this year after they were discovered on videos promoting offensive content like hate speech. More recently, Facebook disclosed that Russians had used fake accounts and online ads to fan divisive issues during the presidential campaign. The social network has also had to respond to the revelation that advertisers were able to target users who used terms like \u201cJew hater\u201d to describe themselves.Still, video is too enticing for issues like those to scare advertisers away.\u201cYou just have what I would actually liken to a gold rush in the content space,\u201d Rob Master, vice president of global media, categories and partnerships at Unilever, which owns brands like Dove soap and Lipton tea, said during a presentation. \u201cThe amount of money pouring into producing and developing content is unbelievable,\u201d he said, naming Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Fox and Hulu.Marketers are watching that, as well as how younger generations are using their smartphones, and figuring out where they might fit in, he said.\u201cWhat is the commercial model for a video on a phone or on the web across these different platforms?\u201d Mr. Master said. \u201cToday, some platforms call video what I would call a digital moving billboard. So how do we think about that in terms of media \u2014 how do you plan or buy for that?\u201dThere were also, of course, discussions that did not touch on seismic industry or societal shifts.During a panel on Instagram, the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, who sells goods under a namesake label, described how she decides to make work-related posts to her highly-followed account.\u201cI feel sort of honor-bound to the people who follow me to not exploit the relationship, not to trade on the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel better talking about the business on our business pages frankly.\u201d But when it does happen, she said, \u201cI try to be very thoughtful and plot out those occasions where I invade the personal with business.\u201dImran Khan, Snap\u2019s chief strategy officer, said that Snapchat users were creating more than three billion pictures and videos a day.\u201cThe problem with text is that text never captured your true voice \u2014 text might grab your attention but it never captured your imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, the way we communicate is changing, it\u2019s becoming visual. With texting, I always had to translate my feelings over text. Now with camera, I can do that instantly.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the announcement of a settlement between the California attorney general\u2019s office and Gatorade.

{"Headline": "Coach Inc. Is Dead. Long Live Tapestry.", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt Coach Inc., which is famous for its leather goods but has become the holding company of an increasingly ambitious fashion group, the name of the game is now \u2026 Tapestry.On Wednesday, the accessible-luxury group that owns Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade announced its intentions to change the name of its parent to Tapestry Inc., the better to express its new shape as a multibrand entity with a variety of unique properties, as opposed to one dominated by a single brand.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful metaphor for what we believe in, which is individual threads of different colors all working together to create a picture,\u201d said Victor Luis, the chief executive, waxing a little poetic.By rebranding Coach Inc., Mr. Luis is hoping to send a signal to potential targets in the $80 billion global premium fashion market that \u201cthis is a home that is not limited to any category, channel or geography.\u201dWhile Mr. Luis declined to say how many more threads he anticipated adding to his particular tapestry, he did note that one of the requirements for the new name was that it demonstrate inclusivity.\u201cWe embrace our differences, whether they be race, gender, sexual orientation or belief systems,\u201d he said. Mr. Luis added that while Tapestry was currently composed of brands based in the United States, he was open to acquisitions in Europe and Asia.To that end, the name was also intended to clarify the differences between not only Tapestry and Kors but also Tapestry and potential European competitors like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (the owner of brands like Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, and the world\u2019s largest luxury group by sales), Kering (Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, among others) and Richemont (Chlo\u00e9, Ala\u00efa, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels).\u201cI\u2019m not here because I\u2019m anyone\u2019s son,\u201d Mr. Luis said by way of example \u2014 an apparent veiled swipe at Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, whose father, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, founded that group.Then he said, \u201cWe are not a group that believes there is a single country where products have to be designed or manufactured,\u201d a reference to the insistence by European groups on the importance of origin \u2014 that there is equity in \u201cmade in France\u201d or \u201cmade in Italy.\u201d Finally, Mr. Luis said Tapestry would include the results of each of its brands in its annual reports, as opposed to lumping them together into a single entity, as LVMH and Kering do with some of their brands.Mr. Luis said it was important for Coach to find a name that, unlike those moves, \u201cwasn\u2019t too corporate-y or made up, that was easy for everyone to understand.\u201dThe search took two to three months and was conducted by the Carbone Smolan Agency. A list of thousands of names was winnowed to \u201ctens,\u201d which were then tested for legality and cultural associations in the brands\u2019 key global markets.\u201cWe were surprised Tapestry was still available,\u201d Mr. Luis said. The one catch: a concern that tapestries could be seen as old-fashioned, and possibly even elitist, associated as they are with European history and palaces. Ultimately, though, the word\u2019s suggestions of craft and handwork outweighed the negatives.Of course, there is at least one other reference associated with \u201cTapestry.\u201d\u201cFor anyone who is aware of the album, Carole King does come up,\u201d Mr. Luis acknowledged, referring to the 1971 record. (He admitted that he had it at home.) \u201cBut we discovered most millennials had not heard of it.\u201dBesides, it is not turning \u201cTapestry\u201d into its theme music. \u201cWe will not be playing it in the office,\u201d he said.The name change officially goes into effect Oct. 31. Tapestry will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TPR, as opposed to the former COH.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kitchen of the Future: Smart and Fast but Not Much Fun", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conference, now in its third year, brings together people on the front lines of kitchen technology to try to figure out how to move the digital revolution deeper into the kitchen. The kitchen is where Americans spend 60 percent of their time at home when they are not sleeping, said Yoon Lee, a senior vice president at Samsung. That\u2019s why so many tech companies are focused on it.Almost everyone here this week at Benaroya Hall, the home of the Seattle Symphony \u2014 whether an executive from a major appliance manufacturer, a Google engineer or a hopeful young entrepreneur with a popular Kickstarter concept \u2014 agreed that it was only a matter of five to 10 years before artificial intelligence had a permanent seat at the dinner table.The coming kitchen technology, they said, will go well beyond a screen on the refrigerator door that allows you to check the weather while you search recipes and update the family calendar.Your power blender may be able to link to a device on your wrist that\u2019s been tracking your diet, then check in with your freezer and your kitchen scale. It could set up the right smoothie recipe based on what\u2019s on hand, how much weight you\u2019ve gained and which fruit you prefer.Your oven will be able to decide how and when to start roasting the salmon, then text the family when dinner\u2019s ready. Your refrigerator may be able to place a grocery store order, based on a careful study of how much you like to pay for certain items, whether you want them organic and whether peaches are in season.Artificial intelligence will eventually understand your cooking needs so well that you need only tell a device that you\u2019d like to make your grandmother\u2019s chicken and noodles on Thursday, and all the ingredients will be ordered, paid for and delivered in time to cook. And when you start to cook, a virtual sous-chef will help with technique; a smart pan will suggest you turn down the heat before you scorch the onions.The smart kitchen might even track how much of the dish you end up throwing away, and let you know who took the last beer in the refrigerator. (Don\u2019t worry! It ordered more.)\u201cWe are talking to them and they are talking back to us,\u201d she said in a speech to the conference, which she urged to think first about what cooks might need in the kitchen and then design the technology to help them.But based on the buzz here, many people see a future in which no one will need to know how to cook at all.\u201cYou\u2019ll get appliances and hardware that lets you perform at a higher level of proficiency than what you can train for,\u201d said Nikhil Bhogal, a founder and the chief technical officer of June, which makes a WiFi-enabled countertop oven by the same name that recognizes the food you put into it and tells you how to cook it precisely.Much of this is still just a glint in an engineer\u2019s eye. To truly connect everything in the kitchen, technology and recipes will have to be standardized in such a way that food can be tracked from the farm to the plate.The dreamers here talked of inventing a single database, like iTunes, for recipes, or even doing away with recipes altogether.Some of the hits and misses from the Smart Kitchen Summit held this week in Seattle.Innit is still in development, but it appears to be software based on online recipes that have been broken down into preparations for various starches, produce and proteins. It will eventually learn, through the miracle of artificial intelligence, what sauce you like on your chicken and whether you have chicken in refrigerator, and then give you a recipe for it.Cooks at the conference were skeptical. It was hard to find anyone who wanted to discuss the joy that comes from cooking, or the escape from a hectic, technical life that softly scrambling an egg in the morning can bring.None of technical solutions seemed to account for how a cook might consider the ripeness of a pear, or thrill from creating a new recipe out of a pile of fresh chanterelles.

{"Headline": "What Virtual Reality Can Teach a Driverless Car", "Date": "2017-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the computers that operate driverless cars digest the rules of the road, some engineers think it might be nice if they can learn from mistakes made in virtual reality rather than on real streets.Companies like Toyota, Uber and Waymo have discussed at length how they are testing autonomous vehicles on the streets of Mountain View, Calif., Phoenix and other cities. What is not as well known is that they are also testing vehicles inside computer simulations of these same cities. Virtual cars, equipped with the same software as the real thing, spend thousands of hours driving their digital worlds.Think of it as a way of identifying flaws in the way the cars operate without endangering real people. If a car makes a mistake on a simulated drive, engineers can tweak its software accordingly, laying down new rules of behavior. On Monday, Waymo, the autonomous car company that spun out of Google, is expected to show off its simulator tests when it takes a group of reporters to its secretive testing center in California\u2019s Central Valley.Researchers are also developing methods that would allow cars to actually learn new behavior from these simulations, gathering skills more quickly than human engineers could ever lay them down with explicit software code. \u201cSimulation is a tremendous thing,\u201d said Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, one of the artificial intelligence labs exploring this kind of virtual training for autonomous vehicles and other robotics.\u201cThis is why we think we can move fast,\u201d said Luc Vincent, who recently started an autonomous vehicle project at Lyft, Uber\u2019s main rival. \u201cThis stuff didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago when Google started.\u201dFor now, if it doesn\u2019t carry a backup driver, any autonomous vehicle will probably be limited to a small area with large streets, little precipitation, and relatively few pedestrians. And it will drive at low speeds, often waiting for extended periods before making a left-hand turn or merging into traffic without the help of a stoplight or street sign \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t avoid these situations altogether.The trouble is that this requires enormous amounts of data collected by cameras, radar and other sensors that document real-world objects and situations. And humans must label this data, identifying pedestrians, street signs and the like. Gathering and labeling data describing every conceivable situation is an impossibility. Data on accidents, for instance, is hard to come by. This is where simulations can help.Mr. Pratt said Toyota is already using images of simulated roadways to train neural networks, and this approach has yielded promising results. In other words, the simulations are similar enough to the physical world to reliably train the systems that operate the cars.Part of the advantage with a simulator is that researchers have complete control over it. They need not spend time and money labeling images \u2014 and potentially making mistakes with these labels. \u201cYou have ground truth,\u201d Mr. Pratt explained. \u201cYou know where every car is. You know where every pedestrian is. You know where every bicycler is. You know the weather.\u201dDeepMind used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game Go better than any human. In essence, the machine played thousands upon thousands of Go games against itself, carefully recording which moves proved successful and which didn\u2019t. And now, DeepMind and other leading labs are using similar techniques in building machines that can play complex video games like StarCraft.That may seem frivolous. But if machines can navigate these virtual worlds, they can make their way through the physical world.Bridging the gap between the virtual and the physical is no easy task, Mr. Pratt said. And companies must also ensure that algorithms don\u2019t learn unexpected or harmful behavior while learning on their own. That is a big worry among artificial intelligence researchers.For this and other reasons, companies like Toyota and Waymo are not building these cars solely around machine learning. They also hand-coded software in more traditional ways in an effort to guarantee certain behavior. Waymo cars don\u2019t learn to stop at stop lights, for example. There is a hard and fast rule that they stop.But the industry is headed toward more machine learning, not less. It provides a better way to train the car to do tasks like identifying lane makers, said Waymo\u2019s vice president of engineering Dmitri Dolgov. But it becomes even more important, he explained, when a car needs a much deeper understanding of the world around it. \u201cRobotics and machine learning go hand in hand,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Driverless Cars Made Me Nervous. Then I Tried One.", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn my fourth day in a semi-driverless car, I finally felt comfortable enough to let it stop itself. Before then, I\u2019d allowed the car \u2014 a Volvo S90 sedan \u2014 to steer around gentle turns, with my hands still on the wheel, and to adjust speed in traffic. By Day 4, I was ready to make a leap into the future.With the car traveling 40 miles an hour on a busy road in the Washington suburbs, I pushed a button to activate the driverless mode and moved my foot away from the brake and accelerator. The car kept its speed. Soon, a traffic light in the distance turned red, and the cars in front of me slowed. For a split second, I prepared to slam on the brake.There was no need. The cameras and computers in the Volvo recognized that other cars were slowing and smoothly began applying the brake. My car came to a stop behind the Ford ahead of me. I began laughing, even though no one else was in the car, as my anxiety turned to relief.When a friend saw me in the Volvo last week and I explained that I was test-driving it for work, she asked which roads I\u2019d be using \u2014 so she could avoid them. Another friend asked if driverless cars could be hacked. Colleagues said they feared semiautonomous cars lulling people into ignoring the road.Driverless cars tap deep into the human psyche. We want to be in control, or at least to give control to trained professionals, like doctors. We don\u2019t want computers to be in charge.They rationalized their own imperfections, while obsessing over the computer\u2019s shortcomings. It didn\u2019t matter that the human beings made more mistakes \u2014 a lot more \u2014 than the computer.The death count from cars exceeds that from guns. So if you are outraged by guns and want things to change, you should feel the same about car crashes.The technology for semi-driverless cars still isn\u2019t good enough or cheap enough. The $50,000 Volvo I was driving \u2014 like a Tesla I\u2019ve tried \u2014 got confused by unpainted lane lines, for instance, and I had to take over. But the technology is improving rapidly. Within a few years, many cars will have sophisticated crash-avoidance systems.I expect that we will agonize about using them, out of both legitimate caution and irrational fear. Any driverless crashes will be sensationalized, as has already happened, while we ignore tens of thousands of deaths from human crashes. But I still expect that driving will be revolutionized sooner than many people now understand.That\u2019s where driving is headed. The shift will be gradual, not sudden, as Google\u2019s chief economist, Hal Varian, told me. Cars will handle many tasks, while a human driver will have override power. The combination won\u2019t be perfect, but it can be much better than the status quo.My own experience also leads me to think that attitudes may change quickly. One of the more powerful forces in human psychology is known as the familiarity principle. After people have experience with something, they usually feel more positively about it.I began my short time with the Volvo too nervous to use some features. By the end, I was confident that the car made me safer. Now that I\u2019m back to driving a nearly decade-old Toyota, I miss the things that initially made me anxious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Says It Overstated Monthly-User Figures for 3 Years", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting.The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent.The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitter\u2019s reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russia\u2019s efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide.Initially at least, investors did not appear particularly troubled by news of the inflated user figures. Twitter shares were up 10 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used Digits, a software-development program. Digits is part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, this year.Digits allowed third-party applications to send authentication messages through Twitter\u2019s systems and did not reflect activity on the Twitter platform, the company said.As a result, the company lowered the number of monthly active users by two million for the first and second quarters of this year and by one million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Twitter said its data-retention policies made it unable to reconcile the figures for periods before last year\u2019s fourth quarter.Twitter said that \u2014 in addition to the uptick in daily active users \u2014 it had experienced a 4 percent increase in monthly active users from the same period last year, to 330 million. The company had 326 million monthly active users in the second quarter.Advertisement"}
