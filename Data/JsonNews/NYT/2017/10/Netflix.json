{"Headline": "California Today: Kevin de Le\u00f3n Confronts a Crisis in the Capital", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Please note: A California Today newsletter from June was sent out in error yesterday. Apologies for the confusion.Today\u2019s introduction is written by Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief.Just over two weeks ago, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Democratic leader of the California state Senate since 2014, announced he was challenging Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, in a primary.Within hours of the letter, Mr. de Le\u00f3n put out a statement applauding the \u201cthe courage of women working in and around the Capitol who are coming forward.\u201d Later he announced that the Senate had hired outside consultants to look into allegations of sexual misconduct, and to review the policies and procedures now in place for collecting sexual harassment complaints.Would that be enough? Perhaps not. \u201cMajor surgery is required, and de Le\u00f3n is offering a Band-Aid,\u201d said Nathan Ballard, a Democratic strategist who is supporting Ms. Feinstein. \u201cThis will be a big issue that dogs de Le\u00f3n at every campaign stop until he does the right thing. A press release isn\u2019t going to make it go away.\u201dThe California Democratic Party Women\u2019s Caucus also called for the appointment of an outside independent body, denouncing \u201csecret proceedings\u201d in which women are forced to bring their complaints to superiors and fellow-workers. The Assembly has scheduled open public hearing to spotlight flaws in the system.And on Monday night, Mr. de Le\u00f3n issued a statement acknowledging the extent of the problem.\u201cUnfortunately, as we\u2019ve learned in recent days, the system doesn\u2019t work if the employees it\u2019s designed to protect don\u2019t have complete trust and confidence in it,\u201d he said. Mr. de Le\u00f3n said he had ordered a re-evaluation of those policies with \u201cthe intention of replacing or strengthening our current process with a trauma-informed set of policies that all our employees, and the women who work in and around the Capitol, can be assured will protect them.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)In the early 1990s, River Phoenix was regarded as among the most promising actors of his generation.Standout performances in films like \u201cStand By Me,\u201d \u201cMy Own Private Idaho\u201d and \u201cRunning on Empty,\u201d for which he earned an Oscar nomination, made him a darling of the critics \u2014 and a heartthrob of American teenagers.Then, at age 23, Mr. Phoenix collapsed and died outside a West Hollywood club on this day in 1993. The cause was drug overdose.\u201cHe was right alongside Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves and that whole generation but just before they started to get huge,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were all these people after he died who said, \u2018You know he was the one who had it. He had this spark.\u2019\u201dOn the night of his death, he was at The Viper Room, a magnet for young actors and musicians on the Sunset Strip.Johnny Depp, a co-owner of the club, was there. So was Leonardo DiCaprio, Christina Applegate, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Mr. Phoenix\u2019s siblings Joaquin and Rain.At some point Mr. Phoenix consumed heroin and cocaine and began having seizures on the sidewalk outside the club, Mr. Edwards said. Efforts to revive him failed.The loss of River Phoenix was widely mourned. Yet he never quite attained the folk hero status of other talented figures who died young, such as James Dean.That may have something to do with Mr. Phoenix\u2019s acting credits, which remained thin at his young age.But Mr. Edwards has another theory: His death was overshadowed by that of another young star. Five months after the night at the Viper Room, Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain fatally shot himself.\u201cIt sort of strange to think there\u2019s this economy of attention in death,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cBut there is.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "The Frightful Five Want to Rule Entertainment. They Are Hitting Limits.", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that\u2019s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline.Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing \u2014 in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches \u2014 are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit.This is the first of several columns in which I\u2019ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment \u2014 their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked.Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201dThe Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.There\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201dThis story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?It\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It\u2019s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Without Harvey Weinstein, Is There a Weinstein Company?", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A bicoastal staff meeting of the Weinstein Company was hastily convened late Thursday. Staff members were scared and shaken after public complaints of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein, the entertainment company\u2019s pugnacious co-founder. With the help of a video conferencing system, David Glasser, the Weinstein Company\u2019s president and chief operating officer, tried to rally the troops.\u201cWe are going to be O.K.,\u201d two people who attended the meeting recalled Mr. Glasser saying. He said his door was open to anyone who wanted to talk and encouraged everyone to stay focused on scheduled films.The movie and television company\u2019s other founder and co-chairman, Bob Weinstein, has a substantial track record running Dimension Films, a label dedicated to horror movies and family fare, like the \u201cSpy Kids\u201d franchise. Mr. Glasser, sometimes referred to in Hollywood as the third Weinstein brother, is an experienced executive. But Harvey Weinstein is the one who called \u2014 or screamed \u2014 the shots, often pushing the company forward by sheer force of will.\u201cWithout Harvey actively managing, the Weinstein Company will become even more capital constrained \u2014 tougher to find funding,\u201d Harold L. Vogel, a media analyst and the author of the book \u201cEntertainment Industry Economics,\u201d wrote in an email on Friday. Even without a crisis, Mr. Vogel noted, the studio\u2019s \u201cbusiness model doesn\u2019t function as well as it once did.\u201dThe Weinstein Company\u2019s board had a heated meeting on Thursday night. On Friday, three members of the board \u2014 Marc Lasry, Dirk Ziff and Tim Sarnoff \u2014 resigned, according to a board member and a company executive. In a statement, Bob Weinstein and three other board members said that a group of lawyers from Debevoise & Plimpton, including one with experience prosecuting sex crimes, would lead an investigation into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s behavior.\u201cAs Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNext steps will depend on Harvey\u2019s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the board\u2019s independent investigation and Harvey\u2019s own personal decisions.\u201dThe Weinstein brothers first came to prominence with Miramax in 1989, the year they helped to activate the indie-film boom with \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape.\u201d They sold Miramax to Disney in 1993 and left in 2005 to form the Weinstein Company. They unsuccessfully dabbled in side businesses, including a fashion label, but eventually found their film footing with releases like \u201cInglourious Basterds.\u201dSo far this year, the Weinstein Company, a boutique studio that specializes in sophisticated, small-budget dramas like the 2011 Oscar winner \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d has released six films, which have taken in a combined $123 million at the domestic box office. (The biggest hit has been \u201cWind River,\u201d a well-reviewed murder mystery that has collected about $33 million.) Last year, the Weinsteins had seven films, with combined ticket sales of just $65 million.To compare, major studios like Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Company generally take in $1 billion to $2.5 billion annually at the domestic box office.The Weinstein Company has also found itself sidelined at film festivals, where Mr. Weinstein has long shopped for movies to release, helping to discover auteurs like Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh. For years at the Sundance Film Festival, for instance, his wallet was the only one that mattered to agents, who would track his team relentlessly. Netflix and Amazon dominate now.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in his more recent diminished state, he remained a player, prodding a tiny, largely subtitled art film, \u201cLion,\u201d to six nominations this year. (The last time a Weinstein film was a force at the Oscars was in 2012, when \u201cThe Artist\u201d collected five awards, including best picture.)In this year\u2019s Oscars cycle, the company\u2019s big hopes are \u201cWind River\u201d and \u201cThe Current War,\u201d a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that is scheduled for a late November release. It received a tepid response at last month\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival, but Mr. Weinstein has personally helped to re-edit the movie since then.Several agents and producers said that, without Mr. Weinstein\u2019s all-or-nothing campaigning style, those films would probably be stranded on the awards trail.As the movie business has become more difficult, the Weinsteins have found success in television, especially the reality genre, with Heidi Klum\u2019s \u201cProject Runway.\u201d That series runs on Lifetime, a division of A&E Networks, and has spawned several spinoffs.Amazon, Showtime, A&E and Paramount all declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein on Friday or did not respond to queries. Ms. Klum, Mr. Sheridan and other people involved with Weinstein Company films and shows responded similarly.One prominent agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to draw his company into the controversy, said that he would advise female clients against withdrawing from Weinstein projects. He quickly added, however, that he would also tell them to ask for a contract saying that they would have zero contact with Harvey Weinstein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Many People Watch Netflix? Nielsen Tries to Solve a Mystery", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the five years since Netflix started streaming original series like the Emmy-winning \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cMaster of None,\u201d the shows have had a question hanging over them: How many people are watching?Outside of Netflix, nobody knows the answer.That\u2019s because, much to the frustration of those in the industry who would like to have a firm idea of just how popular those shows are, the streaming services \u2014 Amazon and Hulu included \u2014 have been fiercely protective of their numbers.Now, Nielsen, the 94-year-old company that for decades has had an effective monopoly on measuring television ratings in the United States, has announced that it has found a way into the great unknown of Netflix viewership.What Nielsen\u2019s data shows, exactly, and how rigorously it is measured remains something of a mystery, because Nielsen did not release the data publicly. The move, however, is a step toward finding a reliable third-party ratings system for streaming services.\u201cThe important part of this is it provides transparency for an environment that has been pretty much a blind spot for the studios and broadcasters,\u201d said Megan Clarken, the president of Nielsen\u2019s so-called Watch division.Nielsen announced the initiative on Wednesday morning, but it has been collecting Netflix viewership data over the last two months in a kind of test run.The company said it was able to determine how many viewers were streaming Netflix content through audio recognition software in the 44,000 Nielsen-rated homes across the United States.Nielsen has been releasing its Netflix data privately to media companies that have subscribed to the service, including the Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros., Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and A&E Networks.Nielsen executives said that those companies would now have the ability to access viewership figures for shows they licensed to Netflix, like \u201cFriends\u201d from Warner Bros., as well as originals like \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201dNielsen executives said the company had not yet begun collecting data from other streaming services like Hulu or Amazon.And there are likely to be questions concerning Nielsen\u2019s accuracy. Though the ratings are drawn from its much-ballyhooed television panel, the numbers include only viewers who are using a television set. If someone watches a Netflix show on a laptop, tablet or smartphone, it is not included in the count.Additionally, Nielsen\u2019s data comes only from customers in the United States, and Netflix has made an aggressive play in international markets. Of its roughly 104 million paying subscribers, a little more than half live outside the United States, according to Netflix\u2019s third-quarter earnings.Nielsen said its numbers would be more reliable.\u201cIt\u2019s far, far superior,\u201d Ms. Clarken said. \u201cSymphony was a small panel. It wasn\u2019t recruited in any kind of capacity to the gold standard that we recruit, so there\u2019s no representation in there. And it was very small.\u201d\u201cIt provided interesting analytics,\u201d she continued. \u201cOur goal is to go well beyond interesting analytics. This is about providing a ratings equivalent to a high-quality ratings service.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moms at the Mike, on the Verge of a Breakthrough in Comedy", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyIt may be one of the reasons the best-known comedy about parenthood has been from the perspective of men. If a female comic built an act around grousing about her children the way Louis C. K. or Bill Cosby did, would audiences judge her more harshly? The question is not academic: Mom comedy is on the verge of a breakthrough.This week sees the premiere of the Netflix special \u201cMother Inferior\u201d from Christina Pazsitzky, a rubber-faced comic who digs into the dark and gory details of raising a baby. Her description of what happened to her breasts in the early months has the tone of veterans trying to outdo each other with their war stories.\u201cSoggy, hanging, mushy purple nipples,\u201d she says, roaring out the last word with disgust. Then she raises her chin, a parody of poise.Ms. Pazsitzky projects the vibe of a slightly belligerent friend who likes messing with you. She snorts at her own jokes and pokes fun at the crowd for being too uptight about certain bits. Occasionally, a nasal note in her voice evokes Roseanne Barr, whose \u201cdomestic goddess\u201d material touched on motherhood but was more of a response to an earlier era of male comics, the \u201ctake my wife, please\u201d kind.Ms. Pazsitzky\u2019s parent material is more in the Louis C. K. vein, with longer setups and exaggerated emotional extremes. When she skewers fathers\u2019 fashion choices for their complete lack of sex appeal \u2014 \u201cIs that a brown braided belt?\u201d she asks flirtatiously \u2014 she does it in a sultry voice, a spoof of orgiastic ecstasy. She doesn\u2019t poke fun at her husband so much as dramatize the loathing and resentment she feels while, say, breast-feeding at 4 a.m., rocking in a chair, eyes bulging out, mulling over how her career has stalled while his is moving on.She applies a similar intensity to talk about how mothers hide their ambivalence about their children. She acts out the euphemisms mothers spout and then, after describing how much she loves her son, concedes that sometimes she locks herself in the bathroom, cleans her ears and considers pushing the Q-Tip all the way in.In the videos, these chatty moms with traces of a Midwestern accent riff on a theme (mom friends, sleep, Spanx) in the choppy editing style favored by YouTube stars like Grace Helbig that turns a conversation into a highlight reel of jokes and quips. It\u2019s slickly produced, but since they shoot in a real house and have obvious chemistry, finishing each other\u2019s sentences, it feels casual, even offhand.These performers can get off a good rant about dumb advice and expectations. (\u201cWhoever said kids don\u2019t need anything but love has not met a kid. They need whatever\u2019s on the TV right then.\u201d) But they are particularly good at zeroing in on overlooked anxiety-producing moments like the financial calculus of whether date night is worth it, factoring in babysitting rates and how you\u2019re feeling about your husband at the moment. Or the tricky challenge of finding the right mom friend.\u201cI seek out someone with the same level of dysfunction,\u201d says Ms. Smedley, whose humor is cutting and sly; her partner has a broader aesthetic, the female version of dad humor. \u201cI need someone who looks like they were just crying and are now putting on a brave face.\u201dThis theme of friendship provides the subtext for the series, because while the stars of \u201cI Mom So Hard\u201d go as dark as the other comics, the way these two women work together, setting each other up and clashing good-naturedly, provides an unexpected argument for the benefit of having children: You make friendships built to last.It is notable that none of these comics criticize their kids that harshly or directly. Is this more of a taboo for a mother than a father? If so, it\u2019s one that I predict a female comic will break to the same success that Louis C. K. did with his comic insults about his children. Comedy, like horror, gravitates toward the unspoken and repressed.And to capture the real experience of being a parent, you can\u2019t overlook kvetching about your own kids. Sure, not all parents go there, but the funny ones do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Adam Sandler Is a Revelation in \u2018The Meyerowitz Stories\u2019", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the quiet opening credits (delivered in a terribly genteel typeface), the first line of the first story appears: \u201cDanny Meyerowitz was trying to park.\u201d The movie cuts to a medium close-up of a mustachioed Adam Sandler at a steering wheel looking back over his shoulder and screaming his head off.This is good for a laugh (and there are more to come), but once Danny pulls out of the impossible space and tools around downtown Manhattan, a different side of the character appears. His daughter, Eliza (Grace Van Patten), has been peppering their parking adventure with some dietary advice for her father, which he shrugs off with good humor. When \u201cHead to Toe,\u201d a 1987 hit by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam comes on the car\u2019s stereo, Danny and Eliza exchange warm reminiscences while singing along. While he may be prone to parking rage (as who isn\u2019t, but as it happens, he gets mad about lots of other stuff as well), Danny seems, overall, a great dad and a warm-hearted guy.But Danny\u2019s father, Harold, immediately establishes himself as a less-than-great patriarch when his son and granddaughter arrive for a visit \u2014 Eliza just for a night, as she\u2019s headed off to Bard; Danny for longer, as he\u2019s just separated from his wife. Played with spectacularly virtuosic timing and emotional misdirection by Dustin Hoffman, Harold is a sculptor feeling unappreciated late in life. This is a state he can\u2019t help commenting on repeatedly, talking over everyone around him: Danny, Eliza; his current wife and the world\u2019s worst cook, Maureen (Emma Thompson); his withdrawn daughter, Jean (Elizabeth Marvel); and later, his other son, Matthew (Ben Stiller), a successful business manager in Los Angeles whose own reluctant visit is extended by a series of mishaps.These characters have a lot to work out, and they do work it out, mostly hilariously. The Meyerowitzes are paragons of a specifically Manhattan-style liberal tolerance: The scene in which Danny and his sister and father react with complete nonchalance to Eliza\u2019s first student film, a self-starring quasi-pornographic fantasia about a superhero named \u201cPagina-Man,\u201d is likely to be cited in a good number of culture-conservative think pieces this season.None of the Meyerowitzes are fulfilled, and all of them seethe with resentment. Almost everything that comes out of Harold\u2019s mouth is a passive-aggressive accusation pitched with head-spinning atonal refinement, as when, on an unscheduled visit to the home of one of his ex-wives (Candice Bergen, in a droll cameo), he makes a beeline to a bookshelf and says \u201cI think this is my copy of \u2018Buddenbrooks.\u2019\u201dAs is customary in Mr. Baumbach\u2019s pictures, the acting is spectacular. Ms. Thompson is hilarious, Ms. Marvel applies her customary note-perfect execution of character, and Ms. Van Patten is what they call a find. And while Mr. Stiller\u2019s Matthew is both reliably and appealingly neurotic, it is Mr. Sandler who excels, both riotously and poignantly.Mr. Baumbach\u2019s fondness for his characters is such that as the movie passes its 90-minute mark, it becomes evident that he doesn\u2019t want it to end. This compels him to end it several more times than he needs to. My fondness for the characters had become such that I really did not mind.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maria Bamford: The First Time Someone Loved Me for Who I Really Am", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe First TimeAt the age of 43, I had never had a relationship last more than a year. My colleagues in comedy suggested that it was par for the course in our business, and that paired with my psychiatric issues, I might never be eligible for lifelong commitment. But strangely, it was when I was hospitalized in a psych ward that I first found real hope that I could be married one day.Back in 2010, I had been dating a guy for a few months. It was a fast romance, but he broke it off quickly and kindly when he discovered that I was having problems with what I thought was just bad depression.After the breakup, I decided it was the perfect time to try a new medication, a mood stabilizer that my psychiatrist had recommended. Then I signed myself into a facility because I was a little scared of killing myself. \u201cSeventy-two hours on the new med, and I\u2019ll be good as new,\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cThen off to four shows in Chicago!\u201d No matter how bad I felt, work came first.At a hospital in Pasadena, Calif., I was speaking with a fellow jittery patient. He was in his early 50s and said that he had bipolar disorder. I was worried whether I would ever work again, so I asked him what he did. He said he had left a high-stress position in international law and now worked part-time at a used bookstore in the San Bernardino Valley. He had been on disability for several years and needed to enter a mental health facility about once a year for flare-ups of depression or mania.I checked out of the hospital a few days later, hoping to feel better on the new medication. But as I flew to Chicago, I knew something was wrong. I somehow ended up bleeding, hysterical and lost downtown without any identification an hour before showtime. My manager heard me hyperventilating over the phone and canceled all four shows.Thus began a breakdown. Every moment of my life felt unbearable for a year and a half of hospitalizations and outpatient treatment programs. I drooled, I dropped glassware, I passed out face-first into Caesar salads. I could not think, had difficulty speaking and could not \u2014 in any way \u2014 work.I kept asking other patients the same questions: \u201cDo you still have a job? Do you think you\u2019ll ever be able to work again?\u201d I kept asking my doctors when they thought I\u2019d be well enough to go back to comedy. Of course, none of them could guarantee full recovery. But I did gather some surprising information that I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in at the time: Many patients had partners and wives and husbands.There was the wife and mother of grown children receiving ECT treatments that caused short term memory loss. A young woman who, after a psychotic episode involving the K.G.B. and aliens, spoke of her longtime boyfriend and all the support he provided when she was fired from her sales job. There was the man who came into the ward after a manic, knife-wielding episode in which he might have stabbed someone (I was very out of it and couldn\u2019t get the whole story). He chatted amiably with his wife during visiting hours.Over and over again, I encountered people with debilitating mental illness who were also part of a couple. They weren\u2019t working, they needed care. They were a burden. And yet they were loved.I started to think: That could be me. If I ever got better, maybe I would meet someone who could love me as I am. That maybe, work or no work, I\u2019d no longer have to wait to be \u201clovable\u201d (translation: \u201cproductive\u201d) in order to be loved.And I was right. A year and a half later, when my mood had stabilized (I still had a tremor and memory problems), I met a man named Scott through OkCupid. It was his second internet date; my 97th. It wasn\u2019t particularly magical, just nice. We met for coffee, and he was easy to talk to. I love art, and that\u2019s what he does; he thought I was funny and loves comedy. He really wanted to go out again, despite the fact that he had Googled me and knew about my perceived deal-breaker. On our second date \u2014 a hike with my dog in Griffith Park \u2014 he was eager to share his own perceived flaws ($52,000 in student loans! Arthritis! An overheating \u201992 Saturn! Can\u2019t travel by airplane! )And then, on our fourth date, he said one of the most romantic things I\u2019ve ever heard: \u201cI know they don\u2019t let you have sharp stuff in the psych ward. When my mom was in there, she grew a little beard. If that happens to you, I\u2019ll come in and shave your beard!\u201d His mother, Linda, has passed away, but I think she\u2019d be proud that her son is ready with a Daisy razor. I\u2019ve been stable for the past several years, but I am comforted by that promise of support.Our mutual failure with long-term relationships (Scott had made it to three years) is weirdly what makes us both so committed and connected. As they say in 12-step recovery, it\u2019s weakness, not strength, that binds us to each other. Scott and I have been moody in front of each other many times, most recently when we moved and he saw me scream for the first time. Over a television placement.But we talked about what is now called The Regrettable Incident of the Television Placement with our couples therapist the next day and later laughed about it with friends. And Scott has had his own embarrassing emotional lows, too. It\u2019s no secret who we are and what our flaws are. I think that\u2019s what love is \u2014 not having to hide exactly who you are. We got married on March 14, 2015, and have been together for four years, breaking both of our previous records.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of the writer\u2019s wedding. It was on March 14, 2015 \u2014 not April 13, 2015.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Katzenberg\u2019s Big Ask: $2 Billion for Short-Form Video Project", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook and went looking for investors, his so-called first round of financing was for $1 million. When Travis Kalanick sought financing for Uber, he persuaded investors to ante up $1.25 million. Reed Hastings of Netflix raised $2.2 million.Jeffrey Katzenberg\u2019s idea of fund-raising is on a very different scale.Mr. Katzenberg, the longtime Hollywood executive and co-founder of DreamWorks Animation, is trying to raise $2 billion for his new television start-up. That is likely to be the largest first round of financing in history for a digital media company that, at least at the moment, is only a concept swirling around in his head.The huge price tag has not stopped virtually every large media and technology company \u2014 Apple, CBS, Disney, Google, Spotify and Verizon among them \u2014 from taking meetings with Mr. Katzenberg. And several Wall Street private equity firms are circling. The Hollywood parlor game of who is going to invest first has already begun. He is looking for big checks.Mr. Katzenberg, 66, is convinced that his new product, called New TV, can upend the format of television for mobile devices. He wants to create the next-generation version of HBO or Netflix, purpose-built for viewing on phones and tablets with short-form content of premium quality \u2014 think of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as if each episode had a narrative arc of 10 minutes.He wants to create big, expensive productions at a cost of $100,000 a minute. (For the sake of comparison, a highly produced minute of programming on YouTube might cost $10,000.) And he wants to attract A-list talent both in front of and behind the camera. That\u2019s one reason the financing ask is so high: Hollywood heavyweights cannot be convinced to do 10-minute video snippets unless they are paid what they are accustomed to being paid.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s hunch about the way a huge swath of consumers will watch television in the future is, in all likelihood, right. The number of teenagers and young adults who have their nose pressed to their mobile devices watching video content is startling. Globally, 72 percent of all video is viewed on a mobile device, according to Ooyala, a video platform provider.The question is whether his idea is ahead of its time. And whether he can find the right business model to support such expensive programing.Mr. Katzenberg is a realist. \u201cWe need $2 billion. That\u2019s a high bar,\u201d he said. And he acknowledges that the financial details still need to be worked out. It\u2019s daunting. He needs to build an instant library of content \u2014 and a big one.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s gamble is being taken seriously because of his long history of success and his provocative thesis about the current television model. \u201cThe design and the architecture of the storytelling fit the business paradigm, not the other way around,\u201d he explained, suggesting that shows were made in the format of a half-hour or an hour for business reasons and do not make sense in the world of mobile devices and streaming.He also took a shot at all the advertising on network programs. \u201cI would actually make the argument that one of the challenges for network TV has been that they\u2019ve actually busted the form by asking people to watch 19 minutes of commercial time inside of 60 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-two percent of your watch time is watching commercials.\u201dInstead, Mr. Katzenberg is hoping to create a premium network that will probably rely on a combination of subscription fees and advertising \u2014 \u00e0 la Spotify. He does not believe he will put television companies out of business; in fact, he needs them as partners and believes they can live side by side.But Mr. Katzenberg does not want to simply create a studio that specializes in short-form storytelling; he wants to create a platform for it. He is hoping that many of the big television networks both invest and produce content for the service.\u201cThis is literally a true moment in time here in which we\u2019re going to create a new form, a new format, a new platform, new content and we\u2019re going to supply that content and we\u2019re going to let them,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg said of the big networks, \u201cgrab what ultimately will be the biggest value here by owning the platform.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve all grown up with this idea that content is king,\u201d he said, explaining his rationale for trying to create a new service rather than simply creating the content itself. \u201cAnd I realized, it actually isn\u2019t. Content is the king maker, it\u2019s not the king. The king is the platform. HBO is the king. Netflix is the king. Spotify is the king.\u201dWhen I mentioned to Mr. Katzenberg that well-heeled competitors like Apple and Facebook are getting into the television business and may seek to innovate the form, he was unfazed.\u201cThis idea that Apple and Facebook and YouTube are now coming into Hollywood with these billions of dollars and are in fact going to change the enterprise of television is actually wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything new or different or unique. It simply broadens the offering and it may broaden the destinations that you can go to, but in fact that fragmentation at some point is going to implode.\u201dMr. Katzenberg believes he is offering something that will start the next leg of growth in the industry.Executives who have seen Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s plan, including Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, and Leslie Moonves of CBS, have expressed enthusiasm for the project.Still, there are skeptics. Several media executives pointed to Nielsen data showing that traditional television still accounts for the bulk of the video viewing among people over 18 years old in the United States. (The country is far behind other nations in video mobile viewing.)And of course there is the question of what kind of content consumers want to watch on a phone. So far, most short-form content has been relatively cheap to produce, because of lower production quality, and customers have willingly watched it. Who\u2019s to say they are craving HBO-level production quality? And many viewers are happy to watch Netflix on a mobile device and press pause on their favorite show or movie and return to it later.But Mr. Katzenberg says that to think about it like that is backward. There is always an opportunity to create a premium product, he said, and there will be \u201ca pretty meaningful subset of people who would actually pay for it.\u201dTo Mr. Katzenberg, the idea is too obvious not to pursue. \u201cYou have an installed base of one and a half billion people who watch 45 minutes of video on a smartphone every day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is where I say to you, \u2018They\u2019re drinking water. We\u2019re going to give it to them in a bottle.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hollywood\u2019s Diversity Problem and Undocumented Immigrants", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImmigration is a part of Hollywood\u2019s story just as much as it is America\u2019s. In the early years of cinema, many of the first regular moviegoers were working-class immigrants. Immigrants founded major studios like Paramount and Warner Bros. in the early decades of the 20th century. And over the course of two world wars, talented directors and movie stars \u2014 mostly from Europe \u2014 poured into this country.Yet, the story of coming to America seems to have fallen off multiplex marquees at a time when immigration has become one of the most contested issues in politics. Sorely missing are movies about undocumented immigrants, an absence that is glaring even in an industry that has struggled to keep up with the times.Reporters and documentarians are sharing the tales of children and young adults brought to this country at a young age, but in the five years since President Barack Obama issued the executive order that established Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or the DACA program, no major studio has produced or released a film about an undocumented character. As some of the country\u2019s major storytellers, why don\u2019t the studios tell these remarkable stories?Immigrant stories once appealed to studio executives. After all, they released narratives like Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Godfather Part II,\u201d Elia Kazan\u2019s \u201cAmerica America\u201d and Barry Levinson\u2019s \u201cAvalon.\u201d These stories didn\u2019t focus on the legality of their arrival, just that their characters made the difficult journey and lived in America. Several notable directors, like Mr. Kazan, Fritz Lang and Alfred Hitchcock, came to the United States from different countries, while others, like Mr. Coppola, Mr. Levinson, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, were the children or grandchildren of immigrants.Like immigration, the movie business has changed since then. Producers have moved away from director-driven passion projects and toward properties with more international potential. Meanwhile, period films about the immigrant experience \u2014 like \u201cBrooklyn\u201d (2015), \u201cThe Immigrant\u201d (2014) and \u201cGangs of New York\u201d (2002) \u2014 freeze the experience in the first half of the 20th century, as if people aren\u2019t still trying to come to this country to start new lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Are Looking Live at Brent Musburger in the Casino", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside this glass box, Musburger, 78, is dressed in all black. He has traded \u201clooking-live\u201d greeting and weekend jaunts to football\u2019s most hallowed athletic grounds to talk gambling five days a week to \u201cMy Guys in the Desert,\u201d who today are Vinny Magliulo and Jimmy Vaccaro, bookmakers here at the South Point Casino.The old broadcaster\u2019s cadences are as strong, his amiability as thick as they were in the mid-1970s when he anchored CBS\u2019s pioneering live pregame show, N.F.L. Today, a m\u00e9lange of features and football talk with a cast aimed at the widest demographic.\u201cHe was our prognosticator,\u201d Musburger said with a wink.More than four decades later, Musburger remains a trailblazer. He is the co-founder of Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN), a family business aimed at building a streaming service offering actionable information for sports bettors.In short, VSiN wants to be the CNBC for gamblers.It may be a niche market, but it is a booming one perhaps on the verge of exploding. Here in Nevada, sports betting is a nearly $5 billion a year industry. In December, the United States Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether to strike down a federal ban on betting amateur or professional games except in the four states that already have operations.A look at Musburger\u2019s celebrated and controversial moments from his career as a sports broadcaster.The case was brought by the state of New Jersey, but more than a dozen other states have introduced legislation legalizing the activity in pursuit of what law enforcement and industry experts say is the $150 billion that is wagered annually with illegal or offshore bookmakers.In betting parlance, the over/under on sports betting becoming legal is three years. Musburger, who long has liked to wager a few bucks on games, takes the under.\u201cYou are not stopping gambling,\u201d he said. \u201cLearn to live with it and move on.\u201dIt was Brian Musburger, Brent\u2019s nephew, who first envisioned a gambling network after overhearing a conversation between his uncle and Vacarro. He was an agent alongside his father, Todd, who had clients like Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers Coach Phil Jackson.\u201cI was with him and a fly-on-the-wall in this conversation where Jimmy told Brent that he had gotten a phone call from a trainer of a team who told them that one of its stars had to have his ankles taped and wouldn\u2019t be very mobile,\u201d said Musburger. \u201cSo Jimmy adjusted the point spread.\u201dWhile the networks and ESPN fill their sports broadcasts with features or opinion and fantasy draft shows, the younger Musburger targeted an underserved audience.\u201cIf you could bring people into the conversation that happens behind the scenes in the sports books, you have a different kind of sports talk,\u201d Musburger said. \u201cThis is the nerve center. Their livelihood depends on getting credible information.\u201dBrent Musburger knew his way around Las Vegas and the people that made it work.One of them was Mike Gaughan, the owner of the South Point.He saw a promotional opportunity and agreed to host VSiN. He built them a more than $1 million state of the art studio. The terms? VSiN agreed to pay him $1 annually for five years.Brian knew that his uncle was winding down a nearly 50-year broadcast career.\u201cUnc, I need you,\u201d he told Brent.On Jan. 25, Musburger announced his retirement from ESPN. Six days later, he called his last college basketball game, a Kentucky game at Rupp Arena. Less than two weeks later, he christened VSiN by anchoring a pregame show for Super Bowl LI.\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave the booth and not do anything \u2014 Arlene would have killed me,\u201d Musburger said, referring to his wife of 54 years.Musburger\u2019s day often ends here at a lounge across from the fishbowl studio. He fishes free drink vouchers from a battered briefcase and returns from the bar with a handful of Bud Lights. VSiN is a growing, but frugal operation: The network was launched with more than $1.6 million of mostly Musburger\u2019s and friends\u2019 money.With more than 80 hours of broadcast time to fill, VSiN leans on bookmakers from around town as well as reporters and analysts from various news organizations. There are remote look-ins and interviews from the other casinos. The network is simulcast on SiriusXM radio, and VSiN is producing short-form videos for yahoo.com.It has launched a subscription digital magazine chock-full of stats and do-it-yourself handicapping methods with more specialized products \u2014 N.B.A. packets, for example \u2014 in the pipeline. It has attracted 1.4 million unique visitors (predominately male and affluent) who watch for an average of 26 minutes.Brian Musburger is raising an additional $10 million and says VSiN will grow tenfold on all platforms by the end of 2018.Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research, says the momentum Netflix has gained shows that information and entertainment is moving from a linear broadcast model to a streaming one.\u201cConsumers are thirsty for more and more high-quality content on streaming video content to watch on any device when and wherever you want,\u201d Greenfield said.For now, however, the dulcet tones and informed \u2014 sometimes hot \u2014 opinions of a soon-to-be-inducted Hall of Fame broadcaster remain VSiN\u2019s most valuable asset.Last month, he threw cold water on hosannas offered to Tony Romo, the former Dallas quarterback and now television analyst, who recently garnered praise for his ability to predict upcoming plays.\u201cTony, get off it. First of all, you\u2019re intruding on your play-by-play man Jim Nantz, who\u2019s just trying to give us the scene,\u201d he said on his show. \u201cand the more years you spend away from the league, you\u2019re going to know less and less about the personnel that\u2019s out on the field. So I\u2019m blowing a \u2018stop the hype\u2019 right now.\u201dDo not get him started on the hypocrisy of the N.F.L. when it comes on its stance against sports betting. He notes that two venerable owners, Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tim Mara of the New York Giants, were close friends as well as gamblers, proud ones.The N.F.L. injury report became a staple of the league in 1947 when then-commissioner Bert Bell learned of a bribe attempt on two players and realized that gambling on football was not going to go away.Musburger says the N.F.L. should drop its opposition to gambling and start addressing more pressing problems like anthem protests and players\u2019 head injuries, which are contributing to lower television ratings and a decline in participation in youth football.\u201cThey are trying to figure out how to make money off it,\u201d said Musburger. \u201cOtherwise, why would they vote 31 to 1 to move the Oakland Raiders here unless they understood where it all was going?\u201dMusburger\u2019s veiled gambling references prompted viewers\u2019 suspicions that he bet on games that he announced. After all, the name of his show, \u201cMy Guys in the Desert,\u201d came from a phrase he uttered often to signal this was what his bookmaker friends here were thinking about the upcoming game.Musburger said that he did only once long ago on a Lakers game. When Kurt Rambis scored a late basket to make Musburger a loser, he said he felt like any other gambler watching a game because he had a few bucks on it rather than the broadcaster who will be inducted in the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame in December.Although VSiN personalities do not give out picks, Musburger put up $1,500 to play in the Westgate SuperContest, which attracts thousands of accomplished gamblers in search of nearly $5 million in prize money divided among the top 50 finishers. So far, he is above .500 and still in the hunt for a cash prize.Now about his \u201cYou are looking live ...\u201d catch phrase \u2014 that was born as a service to his friends here in the desert. Throughout the run of \u201cN.F.L. Today,\u201d there was no Weather Channel or cellphones to check conditions, so Musburger came up with the idea of a live shot that not only served as a tease to the coming games but might move a gambling line.\u201cLet\u2019s face it \u2014 gambling is the foundation of the N.F.L., and every other sport\u2019s popularity,\u201d said Musburger. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun to watch the game if you have a few bucks on it and in this day and age of information, it\u2019s time to bring it in out of the dark.

It wasn\u2019t quite the Paramount lot, but neither did it look like a space for some digital start-up intent on creating viral videos on the cheap.\u201cIt\u2019s a much better place, especially for my team,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cIt feels a little bit more like a grown-up office, for lack of a better term.\u201dThese days Mr. Henick and his team of 42 people concentrate their energies on mining BuzzFeed articles, lists and video shorts for ideas that may be spun into feature-length movies or television series.\u201cI\u2019ll have to go out there for a good chunk of time if the movie gets made, which may not time well with the baby,\u201d Mr. Henick said.Mr. Henick grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., and spent his childhood riding forklifts around his father\u2019s floor-covering business at a warehouse in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg neighborhood that has since been converted into an apartment building. His interest in media and technology began early.When he was 14, he and his best friend created an MP3 website that drew a cease-and-desist letter from the Recording Industry Association of America because it hosted the \u201cTitanic\u201d soundtrack.Several years later, Mr. Henick and his friend started one of the first ringtone sites in the United States. They bought the domain name NokiaUSA.net in the hope that Nokia customers would stumble on their site. Nokia was not pleased \u2014 it served the teenagers a cease-and-desist letter in the halls of their high school, after which they changed the company\u2019s name to MobileSmarts. The business, Mr. Henick said, made a lot of money, although he wouldn\u2019t specify how much.\u201cHe\u2019s an entrepreneur who knows how to build new things and new companies,\u201d Jonah Peretti, the founder and chief executive of BuzzFeed, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m always amazed at the way he\u2019s able to switch between these different models in his head and see the same things through a totally different lens.\u201dMr. Henick\u2019s experience as a teenage ringtone magnate gave him the idea to go west for college. \u201cI was sort of already on that trajectory of wanting to head at least somewhere close to Silicon Valley, to figure out what was going on there,\u201d he said.\u201cThe professor would want to talk to us about LiveJournal and Myspace to a certain extent, and the students in the class would raise their hand and say, \u2018Well, what do you think about Facebook?\u2019\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t even know about it.\u201dFrom there, Mr. Henick studied producing at the University of Southern California\u2019s film school in Los Angeles. During summer break, he attended a talk at the Skirball Cultural Center by the comedy producer Judd Apatow.\u201cI just went up to him and told him as much of my story as I could,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cWe were both from Long Island, both went to U.S.C., and I was looking for a gig.\u201dMr. Apatow brought him on as an intern before hiring him as an assistant, so Mr. Henick spent his second year at U.S.C. balancing classes with reading scripts and checking out sets. After graduation, he worked on movies like \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d and \u201cStep Brothers\u201d before going out on his own as a writer, script doctor and start-up consultant.Along the way, he and Ms. Killoch, who met at U.S.C., started a clothing company. They also got married.\u201cI clearly get bored very easily, because I do too many things,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cI was literally sitting in my apartment writing movies, doing all right \u2014 that\u2019s sort of the dream for some people \u2014 and I was like, \u2018What else can I be doing?\u2019\u201dBefore Mr. Henick started at BuzzFeed, he was worried that he might end up restless yet again. But so far, he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been bored once.\u201dDuring Mr. Henick\u2019s tenure, many digital media companies that once raked in millions of investment dollars found themselves struggling. A so-called pivot to video \u2014 a term sometimes used to cover layoffs of text-oriented staff members \u2014 swept the industry. Increasingly wary of the outsize influence of Facebook and Google \u2014 and hoping to siphon away some of the billions of advertising dollars still devoted to television \u2014 new media companies rediscovered old media, setting off a race into TV and film.Cue Mr. Henick.His mission is to help diversify BuzzFeed\u2019s revenue stream: Executives expect that partnerships with production studios may bring in a third of the company\u2019s revenue in the coming years.\u201cI don\u2019t think we do anything specifically for that reason, but it\u2019s always a byproduct,\u201d Mr. Henick said. \u201cIf our business is stronger and it\u2019s growing exponentially because we keep finding brand-new businesses to get into, it\u2019s going to allow us to hopefully go public or invest in a lot more stuff elsewhere in the company.\u201dDuring a weekly check-in meeting at the old BuzzFeed lot on Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Henick swiveled around on his desk chair, a hand under his chin.

{"Headline": "Reeling From Scandal, Weinstein Company Gets a Financial Lifeline", "Date": "2017-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The embattled Weinstein Company on Monday secured a financial lifeline \u2014 and possible new owner \u2014 from an investor with experience in distressed Hollywood assets. But the fate of the studio, including whether its co-founder Bob Weinstein would stay involved, remained far from resolved.Tarak Ben Ammar, one of three remaining Weinstein Company board members, said in a statement on Monday that the studio, reeling from sexual harassment allegations made against the company\u2019s other co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, had reached a preliminary agreement with Colony Capital for an \u201cimmediate\u201d cash infusion. The amount was undisclosed.Mr. Ammar also said that Colony, which rescued Michael Jackson\u2019s Neverland Ranch from foreclosure in 2008, had entered negotiations to buy all or most of the Weinstein Company\u2019s movie and television holdings. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., founder of Colony Capital, said in a statement that he believed the sullied studio \u201chas substantial value and growth potential.\u201d A deal is expected to take three weeks or more to complete.Not mentioned by the Weinstein Company on Monday: Bob Weinstein, who insisted on Friday that speculation about a sale was \u201cuntrue.\u201d Harvey Weinstein was fired by the company last week.Bob Weinstein is fighting to remain at the studio, but some stakeholders believe he must leave, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Bob Weinstein, who told The Hollywood Reporter on Saturday that he did not know \u201cthe extent\u201d of his brother\u2019s actions, did not respond to a request for comment.In turning to Colony, the Weinstein Company and its advisers at the investment bank Moelis & Company are reaching out to a firm with experience in Hollywood. But some longtime media investors, noting the seriousness of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, questioned what could be done with such a toxic asset.Four board members have resigned in recent days, leaving only Mr. Ammar, Bob Weinstein and Lance Maerov.As a private company \u2014 the brothers each own about 23 percent \u2014 the Weinstein Company has never been particularly forthcoming about its revenue or debt load. In recent years, as talk of unpaid bills and an inability to finance marketing campaigns has occasionally surfaced, the Weinsteins insisted their company was, in fact, rolling in money.But certain financial problems surfaced that Harvey Weinstein was unable to refute. Facing bankruptcy in 2010, for instance, the Weinstein Company sold rights to 200 older films to Goldman Sachs and an insurance company, Assured Guaranty. The exact titles that were sold are not publicly known. Goldman, in turn, sold its portion to AMC Networks in 2015.The Weinstein Company now has assets that fall into three groups: the remaining library of old movies, upcoming films and television. All three are problematic.Given the 2010 sale, much of the value of the library has \u201calready been extracted,\u201d Mr. Malin said.The Weinstein Company has seven completed movies, but some of those are art films with limited box office potential, especially without Harvey Weinstein\u2019s hard-knuckled efforts to strengthen audience interest through awards campaigns. Others are potentially tainted by the scandal that has settled over the studio.One movie on the Weinstein Company\u2019s release schedule is \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d for instance. The first \u201cPaddington\u201d took in a solid $76.3 million in North America in 2015. But marketing a family movie is going to be hard for a company associated with harassment allegations.Anchored by \u201cProject Runway,\u201d the Weinstein Company\u2019s television unit has been a bright spot recently. Upcoming series include three projects for the Paramount Network, the Viacom-owned channel formerly known as Spike. (A Paramount spokesman confirmed on Monday that those were moving forward.) But other television projects have died over the last week as networks have scrambled to sever ties with the studio.\u201cThe question is whether the television division is a going concern or a liquidation,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cSome will argue that the major asset of the television division was Harvey Weinstein\u2019s ability to be a rainmaker \u2014 to line up deals.\u201dColony Capital is the private equity arm of Colony NorthStar, an investment firm that controls $56 billion in assets. Mr. Barrack, its chairman, has gained attention recently for his longtime friendship with President Trump. Mr. Barrack was a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and served as chairman of his inaugural committee.Mr. Barrack, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants who owned a grocery store in the suburbs of Los Angeles, made his money by betting on out-of-favor assets. In the 1990s, Colony Capital bought bad loans during the savings-and-loan crisis and bet on Asian assets after the Asian currency crisis. The same strategy was used following the 2008 financial crisis. Colony Capital acquired billions of dollars of distressed commercial and residential property mortgages and loans that had been seized from failed banks by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.But Colony has also made a number of investments in distressed entertainment assets.In the spring of 2008, Colony bailed out Michael Jackson, who was on the verge of default over a $24.5 million mortgage for Neverland Ranch, his 2,500-acre playground in Santa Ynez, Calif. When Jackson died in 2009, the ranch wound up in Colony\u2019s hands. Renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch, the property was relisted this year for $67 million. That\u2019s down from the $100 million original listing price two years ago.In 2010, Colony acquired the debt of the celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz after she was unable to make payments on a $24 million loan. Brooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles and Julie Creswell from New York. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London and Rachel Abrams contributed from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Amazon Book Battle", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook News\u201cI want to beat them,\u201d said Mark Rubbo, Readings\u2019 co-owner, discussing Amazon as he stared across Lygon Street to where Borders used to be. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of this monolith devouring everything.\u201dBut changing Australians\u2019 reading habits may be more of a challenge. Books are bellwethers of great symbolic weight, not just because they were Amazon\u2019s first product and because the company often uses them to wedge itself into new markets, but also because books and bookstores are tightly linked to Australia\u2019s sense of itself, and to the country\u2019s beloved ecosystem of local commerce.This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school.Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia\u2019s book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States.Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they\u2019ll eventually embrace and come to love.Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon\u2019s arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia\u2019s own writing, and way of life.\u201cOur culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,\u201d Mr. Rubbo said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to defend our voice.\u201dAmazon\u2019s first \u201cfulfillment center\u201d in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products.Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia\u2019s minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom.What comes next is anyone\u2019s guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions.Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn\u2019t explained why it\u2019s taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon\u2019s American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne.Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia\u2019s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers\u2019 hands, in some cases on the same day they\u2019re ordered.\u201cIt\u2019s not about price,\u201d Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, \u201cit\u2019s about the logistics.\u201dBut isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt.For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work.\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people like supporting local businesses.\u201d\u201cI would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,\u201d he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne.But just below his own bookish calm \u2014 and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books \u2014 there are wider concerns.In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged.One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia\u2019s big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers\u2019 orders at the end of the line.The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia\u2019s labor, tax and import laws in its favor.Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected.But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia\u2019s literary culture.The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books.Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation.\u201cWhat makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,\u201d said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: \u201cIt\u2019s a retrograde move.\u201dInside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see.Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent?\u201cWe have a lot of questions,\u201d said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years.He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone.The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia\u2019s well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere.Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. \u201cI like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn\u2019t find otherwise,\u201d said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening.Amazon\u2019s deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price.Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers. She said she was told not to fret. \u201cThey were giving me a bit of a pep talk really,\u201d she said.But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent. Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment. Michael Gordon-Smith, the chief executive of the Australian Publishers Association, sent a statement by email: \u201cWe welcome any new ways to get books to Australian readers and any new investment in the Australian industry that is consistent with good corporate citizenship and respect for creators\u2019 rights.\u201dMs. Wilson and Mr. Rubbo both said that Amazon\u2019s power could bend the will of even the well-intentioned. In their nightmares, they see declining revenues, shuttered stores and silent, dying neighborhoods.\u201cIt\u2019s really crucial that these places survive and thrive,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cI wish I was more optimistic.\u201dTacey Rychter contributed reporting from Sydney.Advertisement"}

More on that in a moment.Netflix has continued to pay for original content \u2014 from \u201cStranger Things\u201d to \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 by borrowing in the debt markets.Right now, the company has held onto a B1 credit rating from Moody\u2019s, a relatively high-tier noninvestment-grade level.But as interest rates keep rising, and competitors like Hulu pose the risk of more bidding wars for content, will that continue to hold true?The high pointsWhat traditional video providers are still worried aboutThe Netflix skeptics\u201cThese financial structures and their valuation implications can be confusing and are grossly misunderstood not just by outsiders, but even by sophisticated insiders.\u201dThat\u2019s what Ilya A. Strebulaev, a professor at Stanford University, and Will Gornall, a professor at the University of British Columbia, wrote in a new research paper on so-called unicorns, start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.When Mr. Strebulaev first circulated a draft of his paper, he said, \u201ca number of companies contacted me, or, rather, their general counsels contacted me.\u201d He encouraged them to point out mistakes or factual errors. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard back from them,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation,\u201d President Trump said at the gathering.One potential hurdle is the group of Republican lawmakers who fear growing the deficit. But they\u2019re an increasingly isolated group within their own party.While Republicans earlier this year set out to rewrite the tax code without blowing a hole in the national budget, most Hill Republicans, from G.O.P. leaders to conservatives have started to side with [Trump\u2019s budget chief Mick] Mulvaney, acknowledging that they\u2019ll grow the deficit for a time with the tax package.What Washington disarray means for businessCorporate America is growing anxious, in part because of the upheaval in the nation\u2019s capital.According to the two latest surveys by Chief Executive, September and October\u2019s ratings for expected business conditions 12 months from now have slumped to their lowest level since November 2016. In September, respondents rated their level of optimism for the year ahead at 6.75 out of 10. In October, it was slightly higher, at 6.85.In other Washington newsThe Trump administration\u2019s hard line on issues like an expiration date for Nafta and putting country-of-origin labels on auto parts could lead to the end of the free-trade agreement.Nafta\u2019s fate may now hang on how flexible the U.S. is about its demands heading into the fifth round of talks, scheduled for Mexico City around the first week of November. While the parties had wanted to reach a deal by December, officials familiar with the negotiations say the talks are likely to drag on for months.A preliminary count of P.&G.\u2019s board election showed that Nelson Peltz lost by 6.15 million votes, or only about 0.2 percent of the company\u2019s outstanding shares.The company hadn\u2019t released the actual preliminary tally until Monday, when it disclosed in a securities filing that Mr. Peltz received 973 million shares and that the P.&G. director with the least number of votes, Ernesto Zedillo, won 979.2 million.Mr. Peltz says: \u201cTrian continues to believe that the election is too close to call.\u201dP.&G. says: \u201cP.&G. shareholders have spoken.\u201dAs the financier (and close friend of Mr. Trump) prepares to negotiate over how much of the Weinstein Company he wants to buy, let\u2019s take a look at the embattled studio\u2019s most valuable assets.TelevisionThe Weinstein Company previously tried to sell a stake in the unit, home of \u201cProject Runway\u201d and a forthcoming mini-series about the cult leader David Koresh, at a $650 million valuation. It ultimately didn\u2019t strike a deal.Upcoming moviesThough best known for award-winning movies like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d the Weinstein Company\u2019s best-known division, the studio doesn\u2019t have a promising slate of forthcoming titles.Its library of moviesAround 200 older movies were sold to Goldman Sachs and Assured Guaranty, leaving little left in the archive.The bottom lineMr. Barrack would get any Weinstein Company assets at a fire sale price.Larry Hutcher, a co-managing partner at Davidoff Hutcher and Citron LLP who specializes in corporate buyouts and disputes, estimates that Colony could get as much as a 40 percent discount if it buys Weinstein Co., based on the damage already done and the urgent timeline of the sale.NordstromThe retail chain\u2019s founding family said that it wouldn\u2019t pursue a leveraged buyout company of the department store operator until at least after the holiday season.In a regulatory filing on Monday, the company cited \u201cthe difficulty of obtaining debt financing in the current retail environment\u201d in the family\u2019s decision to suspend its plans.SearsOne of the biggest believers in the embattled retailer\u2019s turnaround efforts has stepped down from the board, though Sears said that it wasn\u2019t because of disagreement with the company\u2019s management.Sears Holdings Corp. director Bruce Berkowitz, whose firm holds a 27 percent stake in the retailer, is resigning from company\u2019s board later this month after less than two years in the role.Here\u2019s how investors reacted to the news from each company:M. & A.Policy and LegalBanks and BankingPrivate Capital (P.E. and V.C.)I.P.O.s and OfferingsMoney ManagersBusiness and EconomyAdvertisement"}

The nighttime lights of Stockholm, Copenhagen, Reykjavik. A color palette that rarely strays from white, gray, blue and black. These are some of the signs that you\u2019ve entered the Nordic noir zone.And one other: a brusque, grouchy heroine whose issues go beyond cold nights and long winters.\u201cModus,\u201d \u201cMissing\u201d and \u201cCover Story\u201d each centers on a woman struggling with the Nordic noir version of having it all: being a good mother, achieving work-life balance and tracking down a vicious killer.These crime dramas have complex characters and slow-moving plots. The charming accents are just a bonus. See all the titles in this collection on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.Inger\u2019s situation is remarkably aligned with those of the other women on this list. None has a full-time man in her life. Each has a problematic relationship with a daughter who is or may be in danger. Each of those daughters resents the mother\u2019s devotion to her work.\u201cModus\u201d has a couple of other features common to its genre. The mystery plot has a sociopolitical dimension, as the murders turn out to be part of a pattern of hate crimes. And the hate isn\u2019t home grown: It emanates from America.Like Inger, the Stockholm detective Maja Silver is unwillingly pulled into a case. Having chosen her career over her family years before, she makes a vacation visit to her small hometown to try to reconnect with the daughter she left behind. So perhaps it\u2019s karma when the discovery of a body coincides with the death of a local policeman, forcing her right back to work.Sara Dogg Asgeirsdottir plays Laura, a reporter who manages to get embroiled simultaneously with an oil executive who may be a rapist and murderer and a drug-dealing motorcycle gang. She comes with a high body count: In one six-episode season her work gets one family member beaten, another killed and a colleague put into a coma. Her doggedness stems partly from her journalistic ideals but largely from the need to pay an 800,000 krona fine in a defamation case.Shadowed, as all Icelandic series are, by the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, \u201cCover Story\u201d is distinguishable from the Swedish series by its cynicism and a lurid spark that reflects the spirit of the tabloids where its characters toil.

{"Headline": "Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the time you finish reading this article, the upstart sports news outlet called The Athletic probably will have hired another well-known sportswriter from your local newspaper. In a couple of years, once The Athletic has completed its breakneck expansion, perhaps that newspaper\u2019s sports section will no longer exist.The Athletic is a subscription sports website and app featuring pages of local articles that roughly replicate newspaper sports sections. It launched in Chicago in January 2016 and has expanded to full coverage in seven cities, hockey coverage in eight more, national college basketball and football sites, and plans for more. Subscribers get access to all of it.The Athletic is already one of the biggest sports media companies in the country, with about 65 editorial employees. \u201cOur ambition is to be the local sports page for every city in the country,\u201d Mather said.To understand why The Athletic is so brazen about its vulture strategy, one must appreciate the state of play at local and regional newspapers throughout the country. Under dire financial duress, many have put extraordinary demands on beat writers to produce heavy volumes of content, often without wage increases. The reporters are sometimes the most knowledgeable sources of information on the teams they cover, but they are afforded little opportunity to step back and write impactful articles.These reporters are skilled experts feeling the strains of a crippled industry, and many are looking for a way out. Mather knows it.Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn\u2019t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually \u2014 less with frequently offered discounts \u2014 for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won\u2019t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is, What happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic\u2019s business model allow it to survive that long?Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don\u2019t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.\u201cI think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don\u2019t treat it well,\u201d Mather said.After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,\u201d Hansmann said.The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.\u201cIt was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,\u201d said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic\u2019s largest investors, \u201cand knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.\u201dThe Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even \u2014 Chicago and the Bay Area and \u201ca few smaller markets\u201d are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said \u2014 but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. \u201cBuilding a company is exciting,\u201d he said, but the \u201cbigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.\u201dNow the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. \u201cIf there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team\u201d in a city, Hansmann said, \u201cthat\u2019s the starting point.\u201dIt is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic\u2019s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a na\u00efve pivot to video.But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic \u2014 four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.In an email, Kovacevic said that Mather and Hansmann had approached him to be an adviser but that they couldn\u2019t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.Mather said that when The Athletic\u2019s executives spoke with Kovacevic, they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann \u201conly make \u2018promises\u2019 to our customers, employees, investors and partners.\u201d\u201cWe are doing great work,\u201d Mather said. \u201cWe treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that\u2019s on them.\u201dMather and Hansmann also don\u2019t hew to traditional \u2014 they would say antiquated \u2014 norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season-ticket holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was that the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.Similarly, many of The Athletic\u2019s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, \u201cAdvertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,\u201d before adding that it would have to be \u201ccustomer centric.\u201dMather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.As The Athletic\u2019s costs rise \u2014 it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel \u2014 the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.\u201cIn a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,\u201d Mather said. \u201cThat is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,\u201d he added, and he says they aren\u2019t served well. \u201cBleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.\u201dMore journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals \u2014 like The Information and Politico Pro \u2014 or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers \u2014 like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. \u201cThe advertising business model does not align with quality,\u201d Mather said. \u201cIt\u2019s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it\u2019s short-term instead of long-term, it\u2019s serving sponsors instead of users, it\u2019s thinking big instead of great.\u201d\u201cIt really comes down to the business model,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is our core belief.\u201dAdvertisement"}

King is building an audacious new production company \u2014 with a vision for bringing long-neglected stories to the screen.Supported byAt the end of a grueling day and a half trying to sell his slate of new projects, Charles D. King \u2014 the 48-year-old founder of a two-year-old media start-up called Macro \u2014 piled with his associates into the back of a black S.U.V. to make his way to the house that was serving as their festival hub. Until recently, King was one of Hollywood\u2019s top agents, the only African-American to make partner at William Morris Endeavor in the firm\u2019s long history. (If you\u2019ve turned on a television, watched a movie or listened to popular music in the past decade, you\u2019ve almost surely witnessed the other side of a deal King brokered.) As difficult as any midcareer job change can be, King\u2019s was an even rarer thing: Starting Macro meant stepping down from a rarefied perch he\u2019d spent his entire professional life fighting to reach.

He announced Macro not simply as a production house but as an entire media company, one whose content would reflect the new demographics of America \u2014 solving a problem the media industry only fitfully, grudgingly acknowledges is even real.King\u2019s rented bungalow sat at the top of a residential street on a small foothill, but with a blizzard still pummeling the town, the Uber driver found his S.U.V. sliding down the icy grade. Backing up and gunning uphill again only sent the car spinning sideways. After one last halfhearted, face-saving attempt, King and an entourage that included his wife, Stacey Walker King, nodded sympathetically before bundling into their parkas to walk the rest of the way. On the trudge uphill, everyone lashed by the wind and complaining of hunger, King alone seemed enraptured by the falling snow and went loping energetically up the slope, pulling the rest of the party along with his enthusiasm.Macro has made waves with some early projects, like Denzel Washington\u2019s Oscar-nominated film adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s \u201cFences,\u201d but it\u2019s still a new venture, and it has a start-up\u2019s shoot-the-moon sense of urgency and excitement. Inside the house, a boisterous late-night crew \u2014 including several Macro executives and part of the youthful cast and crew of \u201cGente-fied,\u201d a digital project about generational and class tension in the Los Angeles Mexican-American community \u2014 was already joking, decompressing and discussing the day\u2019s films, panels and deal-making. King had brought several titles to the festival, each of them carefully positioned and, so far, enthusiastically received. One of them had become a darling of the festival: Dee Rees\u2019s \u201cMudbound,\u201d a World War II drama about two families from opposite sides of the race line. Still, at 10 p.m., as he sat down to eat, King didn\u2019t have distribution in place for any of his projects. Before starting on the turkey sandwich he\u2019d made himself, he placed two cellphones on the table, next to a glass of sweet tea. \u201cIt\u2019s an old agent\u2019s trick,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou always carry two phones, in case one dies or loses reception.\u201dIn his past life as an agent, King carried no real financial risk: Agents are paid a percentage of the deals they negotiate. As the founder of a media company, each deal he strikes has a material impact not only on his own fate but also on those of his employees and investors. Perhaps the most formidable obstacle to Macro\u2019s success is a body of received wisdom about why the world on our screens looks so different from the real world it ostensibly mirrors \u2014 ideas about how films starring black actors don\u2019t do as well in crucial overseas markets, or that Hollywood has no bias against women, or that Asian men can\u2019t be leading men. There are countless claims like these, almost all of them unsubstantiated, tautological or otherwise self-serving. King\u2019s project is to break down these barriers, and he exudes a quiet confidence in his vision: that there is vast cultural and economic opportunity in telling meaningful stories to diverse audiences. He describes this effort as \u201ca front in the civil rights battle.\u201d Past generations marched for things the law could do, like dismantling housing segregation or securing voting rights. King wants to accomplish something the law cannot: using film to fill in the subtle degrees of experience that reveal our lives to one another. When people look at all the ubiquitous screens that surround us, King wants us to see ourselves. Not only African-Americans, but everyone.In King\u2019s own career, breaking down barriers has meant keeping cool and taking his lumps \u2014 some of them simply for being an outsider \u2014 as he studied the business and fought his way up from a subminimum-wage position in the William Morris mailroom. Macro is the culmination of his life\u2019s work and the realization of dreams he has nursed since he was just another scrawny kid in Georgia. If the projects the company champions do well, then King, and everything he serves, will do well, too. If not, he will have made a life-defining miscalculation. So as the rest of Park City partied or slept, King swiveled back and forth between his sandwich and his phones. His face, which has a boyish enthusiasm when he\u2019s excited, turns profoundly focused when he considers the business aspect of things; in unguarded moments he sometimes looks as beatific as a Dostoyevsky character. You get the sense of a man whose neural network is wired differently \u2014 so much so that I felt compelled to ask his wife, Stacey, about these reveries when I ran into her in the Salt Lake City airport. \u201cOh, you saw that?\u201d she asked. \u201cCharles daydreams. He stares into space. I didn\u2019t understand at first. Now I get it. He\u2019s processing, making connections. There\u2019s a real vision there.\u201dYet each of those recent success stories was an independent production, with origins outside the clubby confines of Hollywood studios. Making film and television is an expensive gamble, and when the people making the wagers all come from a single demographic, the only certainty is that their own point of view will always be well represented. \u201cIt think it\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d says the ICM agent Andrea Nelson Meigs, whose clients include Beyonc\u00e9 and Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis. \u201cPeople buy what they relate to. People buy what they\u2019re familiar with. If the person behind the desk doesn\u2019t relate to the experience of the person in front of it, it\u2019s 50-50.\u201d She illustrated this with a story from her own office, where she was surprised to learn that of several young assistants, only one, an African-American woman, was aware of the iconic activist Angela Davis, the subject of a potential biopic. \u201cIf that\u2019s the room we\u2019re pitching,\u201d Nelson Meigs says, \u201cthat story doesn\u2019t get made.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t help that Hollywood relies on tweaking proven formulas, meaning any filmmaker without successful antecedents they can use to back up their ideas will face high hurdles. The one area where African-Americans have found relatively consistent recent success in the industry has been the popular work of directors like Lee Daniels, F. Gary Gray or Tyler Perry, to which audiences flock for the same reason whole neighborhoods once gathered around the television: because they will see themselves on the screen, and because they know they will not feel insulted by what they see. It has not been easy to secure even that much, let alone opportunities to make more psychologically and artistically ambitious films. \u201cWhen I started it was the age of Spike Lee,\u201d says Poppy Hanks, Macro\u2019s senior vice president for production, who attended the University of Southern California at the same time as John Singleton, and whose early career coincided with the commercial success of movies like \u201cSoul Food\u201d (which she worked on) and \u201cWaiting to Exhale.\u201d \u201cThere was just a wave that gave us a sense it was all possible.\u201d As she made her way into the business, though, she saw how difficult it could be to push such films through the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s always shocking to them when something succeeds,\u201d she says. \u201cNot to us, but to them.\u201dKing\u2019s career has spanned both reliable franchises like the \u201cBarbershop\u201d movies and more ambitious films like \u201cFruitvale Station.\u201d He understands what pleases crowds, but he also understands the narrowness of current cinema and the pent-up creative energies outside it. \u201cThe specific message I want to resonate,\u201d he says, \u201cis people of color have stories to tell.\u201d Part of this conviction comes from his youth, when he watched his mother try to publish the novel she worked on every day after coming home, only to be met with rejection by industry gatekeepers. \u201cI remember the impact that had on her,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made her question whether she was a gifted writer, and she was.\u201d He does not say it, but it is clear in his tone that he still thinks the rejections had less to do with merit than with other forces. The business of culture is one of the most subjective in American society, and its executive suites are all filled with unintentional, unexamined biases. Added together, those biases can still accomplish nearly the same ends as the outright aggression directed at people of color a century ago. There was no animus toward King\u2019s mother. They simply couldn\u2019t see her, or her story.After Vanderbilt, King enrolled at the historically black Howard University for law school. It was a summer internship at MTV that gave him his first real exposure to the media industry, and it was while living in 1990s New York that he met Stacey Walker, a 22-year-old recent Duke graduate. She recalls their first meeting as anything but fateful: She was leaving a party with friends, and King and his friends were on their way in, an encounter he claimed not to remember when they ran into each other again shortly afterward. Nonetheless, they were soon dating seriously. He moved to Los Angeles a year later; after a year and half, Stacey joined him. They\u2019ve been together some 20 years.\u201cWhile all the sons and daughters of studio heads were out with each other, I would stay behind and talk to Rick,\u201d King recalls \u2014 meaning Rick Palacio, the assistant supervisor of the mailroom. Despite the meager pay, King saw the mailroom as \u201ca gold mine\u201d of information and possibility. He was promoted to assistant on the desk of an agent, then quickly removed. \u201cI was not a great assistant,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was too focused on the big picture. What I really needed to learn was that paying your dues was more than going through the motions.\u201d When he found himself with a second shot in the mailroom, he redoubled his efforts: \u201cI was going to get fired or promoted.\u201dHe credits the firm\u2019s African-American clients \u2014 and their managers and other assorted \u201cpeople\u201d \u2014 with making sure it was the promotion. He may have been a junior employee, but some bigger industry players gravitated toward him, in part because he understood their clients\u2019 value in ways others in the agency did not. He also had a talent for building community. \u201cBecause there are so few people of color, we all know each other,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cThere was an unspoken locking of the arms. We were all kids figuring it out. I don\u2019t even know if Charles knows this, but I know both my bosses were putting pressure on his bosses to promote him.\u201dEventually, King says, \u201cthere was a groundswell\u201d of people lobbying his cause. In 2000, he escaped the mailroom for good. Still, there were many within the office who \u201cwere sniggering at the things I was suggesting,\u201d he remembers. One such incident, which I first heard about from Mike Palank, his assistant at the time and now an executive at Macro, concerned a weekly meeting in which agents at William Morris speculated about how the firm\u2019s movie openings would do in each weekend\u2019s box office. The week before one of King\u2019s projects opened, he attended expectantly, only to find his client\u2019s movie wasn\u2019t even on the agenda. He was vindicated by Monday morning, when the receipts were counted \u2014 and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cDiary of a Mad Black Woman\u201d turned out to have the highest gross in the country.Agents negotiate between talent and money. They can connect, nurture and translate, but the ultimate decision-making power lies elsewhere. With Macro, finally, the decisions are King\u2019s. He has designed the company with great care: Macro is situated at the intersection of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, combining the core elements of a production company with an aggressive focus on digital platforms. The companies King cites as similar to Macro include both content behemoths like Vice and nimble midsize production companies like Legendary, whose movies \u2014 including \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d \u2014 punch above their weight. Shortly after I saw him at Sundance, \u201cMudbound\u201d won the largest distribution deal of any movie at the festival. \u201cGente-fied\u201d ignited a bidding war among six networks. \u201cFences\u201d won an Oscar for Viola Davis. Maybe most remarkable, King closed a second round of funding \u2014 just announced in recent days \u2014 to the tune of $150 million. \u201cI think there\u2019s an enormous hunger for these stories,\u201d says one lead investor, Laurene Powell Jobs, who has known King since they worked together on the board of a nonprofit. \u201cHe\u2019s at the forefront. All of us who saw something special in Charles are just seeing what he\u2019s capable of.\u201dStacey has known longer than most. \u201cCharles told me he was going to build a media company on our first date,\u201d she says. \u201cThings never look exactly as you imagine them, but it\u2019s what he always said he wanted to do.\u201d King plans to produce or co-produce between four and six films a year, with a maximum investment of $35 million, in addition to \u201cat least three shows on streaming, or television and cable,\u201d an unspecified number of digital shows and a portfolio of investments in pure technology companies. Projects in development include another project with Washington, as well as collaborations with Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, Van Jones, Eva Longoria and Justin Simien. \u201cCharles and I have been fighting this fight for 18 years,\u201d says Hanks, one of Macro\u2019s first hires. \u201cI know we\u2019ve done really well. Now we have to keep it up.\u201dThe offices are in a rapidly transforming corridor of Los Angeles. The work of up-and-coming artists adorns the walls; the soundtrack is classic rap, and the work force looks as harmoniously multicultural and gender-balanced as America imagines itself. These employees aren\u2019t just betting their fates on the movie business but on interlocking shifts in demographics, culture and technology. Macro, King believes, is in the vanguard of a new cultural universe, one made possible by the shrinking space between technology and film. \u201cWe\u2019re building a global company for a new majority. We won\u2019t be the only one.\u201d He begins listing mighty firms that fell (MGM, Blockbuster, Time Warner), noting new entities that sprang up seemingly from nowhere (Netflix) and theorizing what the landscape may look like decades from now \u2014 before going abruptly silent, to keep from tipping too much of his own hand. \u201cWell, you can imagine,\u201d he concludes, cutting across several lanes of rush-hour traffic on the freeway after missing an exit.King is not the first to see the problem of diversity in popular culture; it has been apparent since the beginning, and like every struggle for equality in this post-civil rights country, in this post-colonial world, it has been a generation-over-generation battle. His challenge to us \u2014 to imagine new cultural possibilities \u2014 also challenges the sense everyone in the old order has of being an expert about the culture. What if the world we think we know is only a tiny, myopic fraction of it? What if the things we believe we understand are nothing but learned patterns? We imagine that wanting to be inclusive and cosmopolitan makes us so, but we continue to be produced by and inhabit the structures that create oppression. This is precisely what makes it so important that Hollywood be truly democratic: It represents so much of the inner, the hidden and exceptional, of this country. If there is no space for the visions of the most talented among us no matter where they come from \u2014 or how strange their ideas may seem to those who cannot comprehend them \u2014 what possible future can we really have but the most ordinary?As the sun set, King piloted his Tesla noiselessly down the 101, oblivious to the way he was disrupting traffic. He finished his final call of the day in the last amber hour of light on this side of the Pacific, and I watched him stare intently into the distance behind his sunglasses in the silent interior of the car. White-knuckling the corner of my seat, something Stacey said returned to me \u2014 his processing, his making connections. I understood he was dreaming.Calvin Baker teaches at Columbia University and is the author of four novels, including \u201cGrace\u201d and \u201cDominion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If Republicans can\u2019t show that a long-term tax cut will be deficit-neutral, they will have to scale back the size of the corporate tax cuts, make them temporary or find another way to pay for them.The prominent economic pessimist David Stockman, a director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration, said Wall Street was \u201cdelusional\u201d if it believed the plan would pass.\u201cThis is a fiscal disaster that when they [Wall Street] begin to look at it, they\u2019ll see it\u2019s not even remotely paid for.

From his note on Friday, \u201cFade the value rally\u201d:\u201cImproved prospects of fiscal stimulus and a rebound in interest rates have contributed to a rotation to value from growth ... We expect growth stocks will outperform given our forecast of modest G.D.P. growth and limited upside to oil prices.\u201dMore from The WSJ:The search for a new Fed chairman has been largely informal until now.

{"Headline": "Out of the Woods", "Date": "2017-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast Friday Netflix dropped the second season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d its surprise hit from 2016 that\u2019s part horror story, part buddy comedy, but above all, an addictive homage to the early 1980s. And while the show, which revolves around supernatural goings-on in the fictional town of Hawkins, Ind., nods to everything from \u201cE.T.\u201d to synth-pop, the nostalgic takeaway for many viewers of a certain age is the overwhelming sense of freedom that the four tween protagonists enjoy \u2014 camping in the woods, riding bikes along empty streets late at night and generally spending a good amount of their time unprogrammed and unparented.I fall smack in the middle of the Generation X demographic, and I can\u2019t count the number of times my friends and I have complained about how unfree and overly controlled our children\u2019s lives seem. Our parents lamented childhood\u2019s fall from 1950s innocence; we worry that our children aren\u2019t getting to experience the warp and weft of life. We rarely let them out of our sight; would we ever think of letting them roam in the woods?Wait. Have we forgotten what actually happened in the woods?My personal Hawkins was the middle-class railroad town of Billings, Mont. One of the places where we high-schoolers hung out was the \u201c15-mile marker,\u201d far enough away from the city line to gather for beer-soaked bonfires. The Friday night bashes were known to include fistfights, contests to see who could run through the flames slowest, sex in the back of cars, sheriff\u2019s department raids and the stupidest trick of all, races home with drivers who had no business being behind the wheel.Was it fun? Absolutely. Do I regret any of it? Not especially. Do I hope my 7-year-old daughter gets to experience her own \u201c15-mile marker\u201d someday? Not on your life.Of course, this isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t 21st-century problems kids have to contend with, including their overscheduled, high-anxiety lives \u2014 but that\u2019s on their parents, not them.Those of us from the latchkey generation both benefited and suffered from all that time on our own. And in our nostalgic embrace of the \u201csimpler times\u201d of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d we seem to be willfully ignoring so much of what took place where parental eyes didn\u2019t roam.Patrick Sauer is a freelance journalist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Big Bet on Streaming Relies on Little-Known Tech Company", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor two days in late June, Disney\u2019s board of directors gathered at Walt Disney World in Florida to wrestle with one topic: how technology was disrupting the company\u2019s traditional movie, television and theme park businesses, and what to do about it?The most startling presentation came from Disney\u2019s biggest division \u2014 a $24 billion television operation anchored by ESPN and Disney Channel. Cord cutting was accelerating much faster than expected. Live viewing for some children\u2019s programming was in free fall. At the same time, streaming services like Netflix were experiencing explosive growth.And that was how the Disney board, which includes Silicon Valley stars like Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, came to bet the entertainment giant\u2019s future on a wonky, little-known technology company housed in a former cookie factory: BamTech.In August, Disney announced that it would introduce two subscription streaming services, both built by BamTech. One, focused on sports programming and made available through the ESPN app, would arrive in the spring. The other, centered on movies and television shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, would debut in late 2019.\u201cWe\u2019re going to launch big, and we\u2019re going to launch hot,\u201d Mr. Iger promised at a subsequent investor conference.Disney had experimented with building a streaming platform on its own, to mixed results. It also toyed with the idea of buying Twitter.But Mr. Iger was impressed with BamTech. Based in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea Market, a former factory for the National Biscuit Company, the 850-employee company has a strong track record \u2014 no serious glitches, even when delivering tens of millions of live streams at a time. BamTech also has impressive advertising technology (inserting ads in video based on viewer location) and a strong reputation for attracting and keeping viewers, not to mention billing them.\u201cBamTech really is as good as it gets,\u201d said Mike Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and technology consultant.BamTech grew out of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam for short, which was founded in 2000 as a way to help teams create websites. By 2002, Bam was experimenting with streaming video as a way for out-of-town fans to watch games.Soon, Bam developed technology that attracted outside clients, including the WWE, Fox Sports, PlayStation Vue and Hulu. HBO went to Bam in 2014 after failing to create a reliable stand-alone streaming service on its own. Could Bam get HBO up and running \u2014 in just a few months?Bam built HBO Now for roughly $50 million, delivering it just in time for the Season 5 premiere of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which went off flawlessly. \u201cThey were nothing short of herculean for us,\u201d said Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s chief executive.Disney started talking about the inevitable shift toward streaming in 2006, according to Kevin Mayer, Disney\u2019s chief strategy officer. But the world\u2019s largest entertainment company had to be careful: It could not embrace a new business model at the expense of its still highly profitable existing one \u2014 at least not until it saw a tipping point.So Disney, along with other television companies, first tried something called TV Everywhere. Introduced in 2010, it allowed people to watch television shows on mobile devices as long as they \u201cauthenticated\u201d themselves as current cable or satellite subscribers. But that cable bundle-saving effort proved cumbersome and never completely caught on.About three years ago, Disney started to look at streaming more aggressively. Disney experimented with going it alone, quietly developing an app called DisneyLife. Introduced in November 2015 in Britain, DisneyLife offered old Disney movies and television series, children\u2019s e-books, games and music. Subscriptions cost about $13 a month.The lesson from that was without new movies, or at least exclusive content, interest was limited. Disney soon cut the subscription price in half. After two years, analysts estimate that DisneyLife has only about 437,000 subscribers. (It was never introduced outside Britain.)So when Mr. Iger decided in June that the time had come to reposition Disney\u2019s television division for growth by offering its sports, movies and television programming directly to consumers, he asked BamTech to accelerate Disney\u2019s option to take a controlling interest. By early August, Disney had agreed to spend an additional $1.58 billion to bring its BamTech stake to 75 percent.Most analysts cheered Disney\u2019s streaming plans, but some investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach. One reason is cost.Start-up expenses are unknown, but Disney has signaled that they will be huge. (Analysts estimate that marketing alone could easily run $150 million annually.) Disney has also not announced how much it will charge for subscriptions to the still-unnamed services. (Analysts are guessing $5 to $9 a month.) What is certain: To stock its own offerings, Disney plans to pull content from other services \u2014 Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm movies will eventually disappear from Netflix \u2014 eliminating an enormous, reliable revenue stream.Michael Nathanson, a media analyst, estimates that Netflix, for instance, pays Disney $325 million annually to license those films. Also moving to one of the services will be reruns of Disney Channel shows, which generate roughly $500 million annually in third-party licensing fees, according to Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at UBS.At the same time, Disney has pledged to make original movies and series for its nonsports service, easily adding $150 million in costs.There has also been some sniping about how much Disney paid for BamTech. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference last month, Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, boasted that his company\u2019s All Access and Showtime streaming services had been built internally.Disney contends that a big part of BamTech\u2019s value has been overlooked. Down the road, as other media companies move toward streaming, BamTech intends to sign them up as clients.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a massive business, and BamTech is going to be a massive winner in it,\u201d Mr. Mayer, Disney\u2019s chief strategist, said in an interview.Still, by the end of next year, BamTech will lose one important customer: HBO, which is moving to a global platform built by its own tech team. \u201cThey understood from the very beginning that eventually we would grow our way to independence,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.For some, Disney\u2019s track record with digital acquisitions is the biggest concern.Before a turnaround in recent years, Disney.com gave the company headaches, with managers trying a series of redesigns and strategic retrenchments.Mr. Paull, a Harvard M.B.A. with experience at Sony Music, will report to Mr. Mayer, who joined Disney in 1993 before leaving in 2000 to run Playboy.com. He soon returned to Disney to work on Go.com, a web portal that eventually failed, and other Disney websites, including ESPN.com, before moving to strategic planning.Though BamTech has proved its streaming bona fides, it still lacks the algorithms and the personalization skills that have helped propel Netflix to success. To fill that gap, Mr. Paull recently hired the former chief technology officer of the F.B.I. to be the head of analytics.BamTech\u2019s headquarters are a massive sprawl. Inside the darkened \u201ctransmission operations center\u201d on a recent afternoon, walls of monitors displayed hundreds of live events \u2014 baseball, golf, hockey, boxing, a speech by President Trump \u2014 being streamed to somewhere at that moment.Outside the operations room, in a series of alcoves, including one that used to house an oven where Oreos were baked, employees monitor games and are the first line of defense if something goes wrong with a stream. They\u2019re nicknamed the Night\u2019s Watch, from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dThe level of engineering required for that enormous volume of content is no small matter. Each bit of streamable content has to be made to fit a dizzying number of requirements. Start with web browsers, ranging from Safari to Chrome or Explorer, all of which have slightly different demands. It also has to fit every iPhone and Android phone. And then there are connected living room devices like Apple TV.\u201cThe complexity there is incredible,\u201d Mr. Paull said during a tour. \u201cIt\u2019s thousands and thousands of different applications we need to build to support that entire ecosystem. Then you add in international and the complexities of languages, currencies, payment mechanisms.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s one of the big, big barriers to entry if you want to have a scaled digital video service.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and a picture caption misstated the prior work experience of Michael Paull, the chief executive of BamTech. He oversaw Amazon Prime Video and introduced Amazon Channels; he did not introduce Prime Video.Brooks Barnes reported from Burbank, Calif., and John Koblin from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Diabetes Monitor That Spares the Fingers", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past year and a half I\u2019ve been buying a medical device from Italy that has improved my life immeasurably. It wasn\u2019t easy: I roped in a good friend who had moved to Milan to buy the device and ship it to me because it wasn\u2019t yet available in the States. And it was expensive: over $1,600 a year.But my black-market purchase helps me manage my Type 1 diabetes without the need to draw blood from my callused fingers 10-plus times a day to track my glucose level, a ritual that had been an unpleasant part of my life for decades.The FreeStyle Libre, made by Abbott, is a flash glucose sensor that allows people with diabetes to view our blood sugar every minute of the day without a single finger prick. While there are similar devices on the market \u2014 called continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs \u2014 the Libre is the least invasive one I\u2019ve seen. It takes readings from a sensor under the skin but doesn\u2019t require finger sticks for calibration, and is about the size of a quarter and as thick as two. And it\u2019s helping me keep my diabetes under better control.There have been some challenges: The Milanese UPS store wanted a letter detailing exactly what was in the box. My credit card\u2019s fraud department called (\u201cYes, the charge for $365 from Milan is mine\u201d).The Libre I buy from Italy has a self-adhesive, waterproof white sensor that sticks to my arm for 14 days. It took some trial and error to get used to it. One sensor flipped off from over-aggressive toweling at the gym; another came loose after a backpack strap nicked it. Finally, rather than the spot on my outer arm that the manufacturer recommends, I tried putting the sensor on the inside of my arm, which is where it rests right now. It\u2019s barely noticeable, although occasionally a small child will demand to know what it is.I can see real-time results on a small digital reader (or an Android phone app): an arrow going up, down or level alongside my blood glucose number. The resulting data set \u2014 averages, trends and patterns \u2014 monitors my glucose status 24/7.At first, scanning the Libre to check my results after breakfast, lunch or dinner was like bingeing on my favorite Netflix show. I\u2019d show the readout, a blue line with peaks and valleys, to friends and family: Look how I stayed in the normal range all day!Or the flip side: Look what happened after an intense workout. Even without food in my stomach, my blood sugar often, but not always, rose during exercise, which made planning tricky. The device gives me a window to the impact of cortisol, a stress hormone, which prompts a rush of glucose into my bloodstream.After a year and a half of paying well over $2,000 out of pocket \u2014 six sensors every three months along with shipping fees \u2014 my condition has improved. My hemoglobin A1C now clocks in around 6.3 to 6.5, down from 7.0, and my doctor is thrilled. (An A1C level of 5.7 percent is considered normal in people without diabetes.)Dr. Pratik Choudhary, a senior lecturer and consultant at the diabetes center at King\u2019s College London who previewed the Libre early on, said there are limits to its usefulness. \u201cIt is just not cost effective at current prices,\u201d he said. Dozens of studies have shown that continuous glucose monitoring leads to lower hemoglobin A1C results but for someone with tight control (like me), a half point percent change in A1C is a \u201cminimal improvement to quality of life.\u201dStill, how do we quantify peace of mind?The treasure trove of data I get from the Libre \u2014 days, weeks and months of data \u2014 has made it easier for me to manage my life. Learning that it would be available by prescription at major pharmacies in the States late this year seemed like great news.But the model sold here will have a 10-day sensor, rather than the 14-day sensors used worldwide, along with an extended warm-up time \u2014 12 hours for the F.D.A.-approved version versus one hour for my Italian model. That seems like a step backward. I also don\u2019t know how expensive it will be, or whether my insurance under the increasingly shaky Affordable Care Act will cover it. Until those questions are answered, I may stick with my Milan-to-Manhattan route.Larissa Zimberoff, a freelance writer in New York City, has been living with Type 1 diabetes for over 30 years.Advertisement"}

And what a shame this was. While it was true that foreign-language pictures in the 1990s never reached the consistent heights of popularity in the United States that they had in the \u201960s and \u201970s, I was mostly offered anecdotal evidence of a bias against subtitles.My explorations of the streaming world and encounters with enthusiasts suggest to me that there\u2019s not a lot of anti-subtitle feeling out there. Checking out the world of streaming video over the past year, I\u2019ve accumulated some anecdotal evidence of my own, which leads me to conclude that subtitling is not a problem for contemporary viewers, particularly younger ones with interests in genre material. I began looking into the subject in detail recently because of the uneven quality of the subtitles themselves.The ins and outs of subtitling are too complex to get into in much detail here. In the days when celluloid was the predominant movie production and display format, translated dialogue for foreign-language movies was printed onto the film itself. Video technology made this unnecessary. DVDs and Blu-rays can have multiple subtitled translations \u201cauthored,\u201d or encoded onto the disc, separate from the movie\u2019s image; called up from a menu, the subtitles are superimposed in sync with the movie.A lot of subtitling on streaming video follows the same principle. But rather than being authored onto a disc, subtitles will either be attached to the video material in a way similar to printing or burning them in, or be available as closed captions, which exist in a server cloud along with the other components of a movie or series. Once the user chooses to watch a film with its subtitles, the streaming service pulls all the components together and displays them at once. If there\u2019s a glitch, you\u2019ll get subtitles running ahead or behind the movie\u2019s action. There\u2019s not much to be done in this case except start over and hope everything comes together properly.Through a spokeswoman, Amazon declined to comment for this article, but in past exchanges on this topic I\u2019ve received indications that the company is in the process of improving its subtitling practices.\u201cAnime is a unique medium, an art form in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Decker said. \u201cJapanese artists have a different philosophy of animating; motion is not as important as composition and framing. And the soundtrack, in the original, is crucial. The interplay between visual fields and stillness and silence is really important. You can\u2019t really preserve that with a dubbed soundtrack.\u201d Mr. Decker also notes that creating a new dubbed soundtrack involves a significant investment. \u201cBut while a bad or insensitive dub can kill a piece of material,\u201d he continued, \u201ca good subtitling translation, made with empathy for the audience and the creator, provides a great new experience.\u201dHow is the empathy ensured? The answer goes back to the site\u2019s origins. Crunchyroll was founded by computer engineers who wanted to get hold of new anime without resorting to bootlegs. One thing that was notable about a lot of privately circulated anime before Crunchyroll was that fans would devotedly translate and subtitle the episodes using home video superimposition technology, with results better than what studios provided at that time.\u201cOfficial subtitling was a little more assembly line,\u201d Mr. Decker said. \u201cCranked out. And fans said accuracy matters. The medium drew them in to strive to understand the foreign culture, which raised the bar on the quality of the translation.\u201d Crunchyroll staffs its subtitling force with many such fans, and they\u2019re responsible for quickly translating the new anime programs. (The idea of \u201cfan translation\u201d is not as newfangled as it sounds; in the postwar era, Herman G. Weinberg and Donald Ritchie translated into English many classics of European and Japanese cinema; these men were critics and academics of course, but also enthusiasts.) \u201cWe have teams around the world, and we can get a half-hour episode of an anime series translated and subtitled, with our own software, in 12 hours.\u201d Crunchyroll\u2019s newest language, Mr. Decker said, is Russian.Crunchyroll mostly translates from Japanese. Netflix has a bigger back-and-forth linguistic challenge. \u201cThe major differentiator for Netflix subtitles versus DVD is scale,\u201d Marlee Tart, a corporate public relations officer at Netflix said. She explained that the company has had to develop its own tools to create and manage the huge number of subtitle \u201cassets\u201d that Netflix\u2019s content makes necessary. \u201cThe tools were easily addressed in our engineering team,\u201d Ms. Tart wrote in an email, \u201cand we have built a highly scaled pipeline for ingesting and processing subtitles, and detecting a wide range of issues.\u201dOne can imagine how wide, given that Netflix reaches more than 100 countries. As it happens, the Japanese language posed a challenge for this streaming company. \u201cWhen we started working our Japanese subtitles, we found that there was no open standard that supported the important and unique Japanese features,\u201d including vertical text, she said. The company is still working on a solution. \u201cIn order to do Japanese subtitles well, we have had to invest a significant amount of time in subtitle standardization work,\u201d Ms. Tart said. \u201cThis effort is ongoing, and we hope to have a single, global subtitle standard by the end of 2018.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Boutrous Jr., warned Netflix that the series would put his client in danger and demanded that the company make changes to the content of the documentary. Mr. Penn did not participate in \u201cThe Day I Met El Chapo,\u201d and it largely revolves around Ms. del Castillo\u2019s account. The documentary has not been changed.Mr. Penn is apparently upset because he believes the documentary implies that he helped the authorities at the Department of Justice in their capture of El Chapo.\u201cIt is reprehensible that, in their ongoing, relentless efforts to gain additional attention and publicity, Ms. del Castillo and her team (who have zero firsthand knowledge) have sought to create this profoundly false, foolish, and reckless narrative,\u201d Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Mr. Penn, said in an email. \u201cThe notion that Mr. Penn or anyone on his behalf alerted D.O.J. to the trip is a complete fabrication and baldfaced lie. It never happened, nor would there have been any reason for it to have happened.\u201dDavid Broome, who produced the series, said, \u201cWe never say in this documentary that Sean Penn is in cahoots with the D.O.J.\u201dWhen Mr. Penn wrote about the meeting with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n for Rolling Stone, it prompted controversy and befuddlement over how an Academy Award-winning actor was able to find and sit down with a notorious drug dealer who had twice escaped prison.The documentary series began last year when Ms. del Castillo met with Mr. Broome, a reality show producer on shows like \u201cThe Biggest Loser\u201d and \u201cUltimate Beastmaster,\u201d and they decided to make something that focused on her side of the story.In addition to Ms. del Castillo, her friends and family members are interviewed, along with journalists and law enforcement officials. Mr. Broome said that he and Netflix both tried to get Mr. Penn\u2019s participation, but received no response.Then, in late September, one of Mr. Penn\u2019s lawyers, Mathew Rosengart, requested that Mr. Penn be able to see the movie, claiming that similar requests from the actor\u2019s agent, Bryan Lourd, went ignored.After Mr. Penn watched it, Mr. Broome said, he said that he wanted to be interviewed and demanded that changes be made.\u201cThey tried to put on pressure and demand we change the documentary,\u201d Mr. Broome said.In a letter sent to the lawyer for Mr. Broome\u2019s production company on Oct. 14, Mr. Boutrous said Ms. del Castillo was providing a \u201creckless, misleading and self-serving\u201d account.\u201cIt is profoundly disappointing that Netflix and your clients have chosen to disregard the extreme danger they are knowingly creating,\u201d he wrote.In an earlier letter that Netflix\u2019s general counsel, David Hyman, wrote to Mr. Rosengart, he said that \u201cto the extent that Mr. Penn may be in any physical danger, it is as result of his decision to meet with El Chapo in 2015.\u201dIn a statement, Netflix said: \u201cPenn was given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate in \u2018The Day I Met El Chapo\u2019 and did not do so. The events surrounding the now-infamous meeting have been well covered, including by Penn himself in Rolling Stone and his many public comments since. The only new ground we\u2019re breaking with this series is to give Kate a chance to finally tell her side of this stranger-than-fiction story.\u201dBrooks Barnes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering From Severe Anxiety?", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "FeatureParents, therapists and schools are struggling to figure out whether helping anxious teenagers means protecting them or pushing them to face their fears.Supported byNot coincidentally, failure was one of Jake\u2019s biggest fears. He worried about it privately; maybe he couldn\u2019t keep up with his peers, maybe he wouldn\u2019t succeed in life. The relentless drive to avoid such a fate seemed to come from deep inside him. He considered it a strength.Jake\u2019s parents knew he could be high-strung; in middle school, they sent him to a therapist when he was too scared to sleep in his own room. But nothing prepared them for the day two years ago when Jake, then 17, seemingly \u201cran 150 miles per hour into a brick wall,\u201d his mother said. He refused to go to school and curled up in the fetal position on the floor. \u201cI just can\u2019t take it!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand!\u201dJake was right \u2014 his parents didn\u2019t understand. Jake didn\u2019t really understand, either. But he also wasn\u2019t good at verbalizing what he thought he knew: that going to school suddenly felt impossible, that people were undoubtedly judging him, that nothing he did felt good enough. \u201cAll of a sudden I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so afraid.\u201d His tall, lanky frame succumbed, too. His stomach hurt. He had migraines. \u201cYou know how a normal person might have their stomach lurch if they walk into a classroom and there\u2019s a pop quiz?\u201d he told me. \u201cWell, I basically started having that feeling all the time.\u201dAlarmed, Jake\u2019s parents sent him to his primary-care physician, who prescribed Prozac, an antidepressant often given to anxious teenagers. It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work \u2014 and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake \u201cmuch more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,\u201d his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake\u2019s father wrote: \u201cJake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.\u201d A week later, though, Jake couldn\u2019t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse\u2019s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. \u201cIt was the depth of hell,\u201d his mother told me.Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing \u2014 and learning to talk back to \u2014 their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That\u2019s an easy exercise for anxious young people (\u201cOnly three?\u201d one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a \u201cstrong and powerful response\u201d to each negative thought.She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,\u201d Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, \u201cthen I\u2019ll get a bad grade in the class, I won\u2019t get into the college I want, I won\u2019t get a good job and I\u2019ll be a total failure.\u201dAt Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake\u2019s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn\u2019t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down \u2014 and that his value as a person didn\u2019t depend on where he went to school.Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn\u2019t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn\u2019t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.At the last one, Jillian\u2019s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.\u201cIf it\u2019s too much, you can stop,\u201d the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. \u201cNo, I feel like I need to do this,\u201d she announced. \u201cI have a week and a half left. If I can\u2019t get through something like this here ...\u201dHer voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing \u2014 and much less forgiving.\u201cAnxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,\u201d explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center\u2019s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: \u201cThe overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.\u201d\u201cThe fears can be very real for our kids,\u201d explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic\u2019s medical director. \u201cOftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there\u2019s a history of trauma and abuse.\u201d The contemporary political climate can also feel \u201cincredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,\u201d Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who \u201cact out\u201d are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves \u2014 anxiety specialists call them \u201csilent sufferers\u201d \u2014 are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. \u201cIf you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,\u201d Kendall says. \u201cWhen you start to talk about anxiety, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, those are the kids we like!\u2019\u2009\u201dTeenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. \u201cThese kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,\u201d she says, but there\u2019s \u201ccontempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.\u201dFor many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they \u201cnever get to the point where they can say, \u2018I\u2019ve done enough, and now I can stop,\u2019\u2009\u201d Luthar says. \u201cThere\u2019s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they\u2019re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. \u201cTeenagers used to tell me, \u2018I just need to get my parents off my back,\u2019\u2009\u201d recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. \u201cNow so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.\u201dThough there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there\u2019s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. \u201cThey wonder about whether it\u2019s safe to go to a movie theater,\u201d she said.When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn\u2019t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids\u2019 digital habits \u2014 round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers \u2014 were partly to blame for their children\u2019s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation\u2019s relationship to social media. \u201cI don\u2019t think we realize how much it\u2019s affecting our moods and personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media is a tool, but it\u2019s become this thing that we can\u2019t live without but that\u2019s making us crazy.\u201dWhile smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. \u201cIt was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,\u201d he said. Jake\u2019s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the \u201cillusion of control and certainty\u201d that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. \u201cTeens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who\u2019s checked in online,\u201d Ashworth told the parents. \u201cBut life doesn\u2019t always come with that kind of certainty, and they\u2019re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.\u201dJean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. \u201cIt seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn\u2019t much evidence for it,\u201d she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is \u201call wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy was improving by the time the increase started.\u201dMore than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to convince them anymore,\u201d she told me. \u201cSchools are coming to us, eager for help.\u201dA gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety \u201cthe cult leader\u201d \u2014 for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves \u2014 and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. \u201cAnxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,\u201d Lyons explained. \u201cWhen we play along, we don\u2019t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.\u201dShe pointed to the increasing use of \u201c504 plans,\u201d a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door \u2014 to avoid the chaos of the main entrance \u2014 and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are \u201cavoidance-based and teach zero skills.\u201d She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager \u201ccan go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,\u201d she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student \u201cexternalize his worry,\u201d similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.\u201cIf anxiety could talk, it would say, \u2018You know, let\u2019s just get out of here. We don\u2019t have to do this!\u2019\u2009\u201d Lyons said from the stage. \u201cBut in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I\u2019m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they\u2019re so frail, like they can\u2019t handle things.\u201dLyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces \u2014 and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. \u201cKids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can\u2019t handle being triggered, that they shouldn\u2019t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,\u201d she told me.Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word \u2014 \u201cresiliency\u201d \u2014 kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren\u2019t \u201cequipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,\u201d a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety \u2014 and as more of those \u201cstop coming to school, because they just can\u2019t.\u201dSome schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called \u201cour more fragile students.\u201d At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch\u2019s painting \u201cThe Scream.\u201d These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck \u2014 not that anyone was keeping score.I couldn\u2019t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs\u2019 teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?\u201cSome will say that this feeds the monster,\u201d concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We\u2019ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don\u2019t come to school if they have to spend all day in\u201d general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury\u2019s regular classes \u2014 and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program\u2019s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program\u2019s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to \u201csacrifice the anxious kid\u201d in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. \u201cWhat\u2019s the issue today?\u201d I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a \u201cHail Mary,\u201d as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone \u201cright next to his face,\u201d he rarely responds when he\u2019s feeling anxious. \u201cI appreciate you picking up \u2014 you don\u2019t normally do that,\u201d Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to \u201chide from, control and avoid\u201d their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.Critelli looked at him incredulously. \u201cDude, you\u2019re failing physics,\u201d Critelli said. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have anything to do?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do \u2014 I\u2019m going to fail,\u201d the student mumbled.\u201cSo you\u2019re just accepting that you\u2019re going to fail?\u201d The boy looked at his hands. \u201cHere\u2019s an idea,\u201d Critelli continued. \u201cYou can email your teacher and say, \u2018What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?\u2019\u2009\u201dCritelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you advocate for yourselves!\u201dWhile he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. \u201cThat was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn\u2019t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,\u201d he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had \u201caced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.\u201d But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. \u201cJust being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCollege is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.\u201dThe doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn\u2019t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a \u201cWalking Dead\u201d costume contest at a local car dealership.While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series\u2019s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. \u201cI\u2019d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them were like, \u2018Just kill yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201dNothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn\u2019t want to open up and be known as \u201cthe anxious girl.\u201d There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,\u201d the headmaster told me \u2014 but Jillian didn\u2019t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backward,\u201d she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. \u201cThere\u2019s feeling a weight on your chest, and there\u2019s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as I\u2019d wake up, it was absolute dread.\u201dNeeding to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother \u2014 who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support \u2014 could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn\u2019t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn\u2019t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was \u201cmanipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn\u2019t feel like doing,\u201d she said.\u201cThe million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she\u2019s going to have a panic attack?\u201d Allison told me. \u201cI feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.\u201dHe also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children\u2019s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they\u2019ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they\u2019re afraid to. \u201cSo many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,\u201d Ashworth said.While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a \u201clet\u2019s not take life \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 too seriously\u201d approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, \u201cyou\u2019ve just made his day,\u201d Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn\u2019t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn\u2019t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. \u201cWe basically said, \u2018O.K., anxiety, you win.\u2019\u2009\u201dJillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. \u201cI\u2019m just a lot more relaxed now,\u201d she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with \u201cStar Wars\u201d posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of \u201cChicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.\u201d Near her bed were two prescription bottles \u2014 one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be \u201ca lot worse if I wasn\u2019t taking them.\u201dThough she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule \u2014 including yoga, studying and cleaning her room \u2014 that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at \u201cStar Wars\u201d conventions or on social media.At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.\u201cO.K., I\u2019m going to go mingle,\u201d she announced.But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. \u201cWe\u2019re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,\u201d says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cAnd when we do give them therapy, it\u2019s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we\u2019re not treating people with what actually works best.\u201dPart of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren\u2019t typically eager to feel more anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s also uncomfortable for many therapists,\u201d Whiteside told me. \u201cMost people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you\u2019re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s not much fun for anybody. It\u2019s much easier to sit in a therapist\u2019s office and talk about feelings.\u201dFor two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.\u201cEven better \u2014 let\u2019s make it weird,\u201d Randolph told him.The boy shook his head. \u201cMaybe the guy\u2019s on break and doesn\u2019t want to be bothered.\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cHe might hate you. He might get real mad at you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s terrifying,\u201d the teenager confessed. \u201cAnd what if we\u2019re so close on the bench that we\u2019re touching?\u201d\u201cThat would be awkward,\u201d Randolph said with a half-smile.The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. \u201cIs he sitting in the middle of the bench?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 he might be,\u201d Randolph told him. \u201cBut are you going to \u2018what if\u2019 this to death, or are you going to do it?\u201dHe eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: \u201cI\u2019ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.\u201d The \u201cAsk Me\u201d was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including \u201cB*tch,\u201d \u201cF*ggot,\u201d \u201cUr Fat\u201d and \u201cKill Yourself.\u201d Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas\u2019s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas\u2019s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. \u201cOh, my God, that was the greatest,\u201d Thomas announced upon his return.I asked him what they\u2019d talked about. \u201cThe muscular dude said he\u2019s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,\u201d Thomas told us. \u201cThen the girl said, \u2018You\u2019re really brave. Can I give you a hug?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what you were expecting, huh?\u201d Randolph said. \u201cInstead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.\u201d\u201cYeah, it was awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel so good!\u201d\u201cAnd what if he was?\u201d Randolph asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for what he\u2019s thinking.\u201dThe boy appeared to consider Randolph\u2019s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, \u201cexactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it\u2019s all manageable.\u201dLast month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. \u201cThe health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,\u201d he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home \u2014 and some of his peers from Mountain Valley \u2014 via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. \u201cMy junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn\u2019t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think like that anymore.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that Jake doesn\u2019t study. He does \u2014 usually days before he needs to. \u201cProcrastination isn\u2019t a good idea for me,\u201d he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato\u2019s \u201cRepublic.\u201dJake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn\u2019t gone through. He said he felt \u201ca sudden burst of anxiety\u201d \u2014 his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was \u201cfreaking out.\u201d Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cThat ended that crisis,\u201d Jake told me.For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university\u2019s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. \u201cI just haven\u2019t felt like I need it here,\u201d Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: \u201cI know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.\u201dI was curious how much of Jake\u2019s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn\u2019t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. \u201cI would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot\u2019s changed.\u201dBefore walking back to his dorm, where Jake\u2019s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A\u2019s that semester. The old Jake might have been first in line. But the new Jake? He hadn\u2019t bothered to show up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Their Love Letter to Aunt Joan (Didion)", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe actor and filmmaker Griffin Dunne learned that his aunt, the writer Joan Didion, had become the new face of the fashion brand C\u00e9line the same way the rest of the world did: He saw the picture on the internet. He was traveling at the time, and all of a sudden, he said, \u201cmy phone exploded. Everyone was calling about that photo.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s Joan,\u201d Ms. Dunne, 34, said, sitting on a recent morning in her cozy West Village townhouse with a bespectacled Mr. Dunne, 62, drinking his second cup of coffee. \u201cShe\u2019s still really savvy. She recognizes good style, and how to create a moment.\u201dMs. Didion was also savvy about whom she chose as her documentarians. She had been approached several times by filmmakers, but she turned them all down, Mr. Dunne said. It was only when she felt that the movie could stay within the family that she allowed unprecedented access to her archive and granted her nephew a series of frank interviews in a process that proved personally wrenching for him. As a member of a family that has been particularly touched by loss and grief, Mr. Dunne had to experience past tragedies all over again in order to make the film.Though fans admire Ms. Didion\u2019s ability to write coolly about matters of the heart, Mr. Dunne said that he could not separate his emotions from the filmmaking. \u201cIt was always going to be a love letter,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my Aunt Joan.\u201dIn the new film, \u201cJoan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,\u201d which reaches theaters and Netflix on Oct. 27, Ms. Didion\u2019s notably distant cool is immediately apparent when she discusses her classic 1967 essay, \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem,\u201d which chronicled the dark side of the hippie movement in San Francisco. While reporting on free love and flower children, Ms. Didion encountered a harrowing scene inside a flophouse, where a 5-year-old girl was tripping on LSD. When Mr. Dunne pressed Ms. Didion to describe this incident for the documentary, she said, \u201cLet me tell you, it was gold. That\u2019s the long and the short of it, is you live for moments like that if you are doing a piece. Good or bad.\u201dMs. Didion\u2019s candid comment, recorded during a long conversation in 2013 that makes up the bulk of the documentary, reflects the levelheaded yet ambitious tone that made \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem\u201d and her first essay collection of the same name a national sensation in 1968. Though she had already published one novel, \u201cRun River,\u201d in 1963, it was her nonfiction that turned Ms. Didion into a writer-celebrity, a glamorous cultural space she still occupies five decades later. In her long career, Ms. Didion has published more than a dozen books, written or co-written six screenplays, and received the National Book Award and the National Humanities Medal.Still, Mr. Dunne said, she waited a long time to consent to a documentary. \u201cShe kept saying no,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until she asked me to film the trailer for her book \u2018Blue Nights\u2019 in 2011 that I started to think about being the one to do it. I saw how much she loved the process. I thought, this is all going so great, why don\u2019t I just ask her?\u201dTo his delight, she said yes. Writing via email, Ms. Didion said: \u201cI\u2019m still not sure it is the right time. Six years ago, when I said yes, it did not seem possible that the time to actually do it would ever arrive. I\u2019m naturally skeptical that these things can work. But here we are.\u201dMs. Dunne said with a laugh, \u201cOf course, neither of you knew what you were getting into,\u201d and Mr. Dunne agreed.\u201cThe gravity and the burden of responsibility only kicked in later,\u201d he said, after it became clear how much interest there was in a Didion documentary. A crowdfunding campaign for the film reached its goal in one day and news that the project was in the works made international headlines. He realized, \u201cI better not screw this up.\u201d\u201cI think it was easier for her than it was for me,\u201d Mr. Dunne said, adding, \u201cFor me, the good news was I\u2019m related, so I got permission to make this movie. The bad news was I am related, so I know all the people she lost. Quintana is my cousin, John is my uncle, and I have to make her go through it all over again. If I was a more dispassionate, regular documentarian, that would be questions on the clipboard.\u201dStill, Ms. Didion, who saw several cuts of the film along the way, said, \u201cI did find it fortifying to know that I was telling these secrets to people who regarded them as such.\u201dThe feeling was mutual. \u201cI was really conscious of how just through attrition, there was just Joan and I in the room,\u201d Mr. Dunne said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the reasons she let me make the movie. I know all those people who are not here, I loved all those people, we share that love.\u201d\u201cWithout being too mystical, I was always aware of my parents, and John, and Quintana, in the editing room,\u201d he added, his chin shaking, fighting back tears. \u201cAnd I think they would have liked it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Man Who Photographed Ghosts", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionBefore there\u2019s even a chance to delve into \u201cThe Apparitionists,\u201d the frontispiece gives the whole thing away. It\u2019s a quote \u2014 I\u2019d never seen it before \u2014 from Franz Kafka: \u201cNothing can be so deceiving as a photograph.\u201d It immediately caught my interest because it captures something that I already believe: that photography is inextricably connected with lying. How could it be otherwise? I have a theory of how language started. Whether it was in the Garden of Eden or in some primal swamp, Og was trying to trick Ug into believing the wildebeest went to the right when in fact it had gone to the left. He at first tried various forms of gesticulation and pointing, but was unclear whether he had effectively communicated his deception to Ug. Suddenly it occurred to him that if he said, \u201cThe wildebeest went to the right,\u201d he could more effectively trick Ug into believing this falsehood. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine that language could have been invented without the simultaneous need to communicate and to deceive. In fact, in my more pessimistic moments \u2014 they occur fairly frequently \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to imagine communication without deception. They go hand in hand.So how does photography fit in with all of this? Isn\u2019t lying, if you buy into my argument, an artifact of language? Where are the verbs, the adjectives, the nouns in a photograph? They\u2019re nowhere to be found. That alone has led me to assert that photographs have no truth value. They can\u2019t be true, false or anything in between, whatever that might be. However, stick a sentence next to a photograph and you have a potent missile more powerful than anything dreamed up by either Donald Trump or Kim Jong-un.In \u201cThe Apparitionists,\u201d Peter Manseau takes us on an expedition through the beginnings of photography and its deceptions. No sooner had people invented a way of creating photographic images (whether it was a daguerreotype, an ambrotype or a hallotype) than people found ways of altering the images \u2014 and, even more relevantly, of lying about their contents and how they were obtained. A photograph, as we well know, can\u2019t talk back. It\u2019s like a piece of taxidermy. It can\u2019t say to us, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a picture of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d And often the provenance of a photograph, its causal connection to the world, is hidden. All we\u2019re left with is an image that, for all intents and purposes, could have been given to us by aliens. This is where Manseau comes in. In a world overcome with death and the horrible losses of the Civil War, people turned to photography hoping to be united with deceased loved ones in perpetuity. It\u2019s that strange combination of desire, hope and the presence of an image that seems almost alive that makes us think we\u2019re in contact with a timeless realm that transcends death.\u201cThe Apparitionists\u201d is a primer on cultural crosscurrents in mid-19th-century America, focusing on the religious movement of spiritualism and on \u201cspirit photography.\u201d In today\u2019s literature and discourse, there has been a focus on death as it figured in this historical period \u2014 from Drew Gilpin Faust\u2019s nonfiction book \u201cThis Republic of Suffering\u201d to George Saunders\u2019s novel \u201cLincoln in the Bardo.\u201d But rarely has the focus turned on the role of the dead in 19th-century photography, from the scores of Civil War casualties captured at Antietam and Gettysburg by photographers like Alexander Gardner, Timothy O\u2019Sullivan, James Gibson and Mathew Brady, to the world of spirit photography immortalized, metaphorically at least, by William H. Mumler.The trial of William Mumler, liberally excerpted in Part III of the book, is a landmark in the histories of photography and of America. It all started when the Irish immigrant and ardent Catholic Patrick V. Hickey encountered Mumler and his photographs at a meeting of the Photographic Section of the American Institute, held at New York\u2019s Cooper Union. Suspicious of Mumler\u2019s heretical trade, he visited him at his studio the following day. Hickey remained unconvinced about the verity of Mumler\u2019s art, and went to the city marshal\u2019s office to file a grievance. Marshal Joseph Tooker, Mayor A. Oakley Hall\u2019s \u201cconfidant and crony,\u201d took the case, visiting Mumler\u2019s studio under the alias William Wallace and arresting Mumler after Tooker failed to recognize the apparition who appeared with him in Mumler\u2019s photograph. A battle between science and spirituality, the case reads as a forerunner of the Scopes trial. On one hand, we could simply call it a foregone conclusion: There are no spirits, hence there are no spirit photographs. If, however, you refrain from that assumption, the debate becomes much stickier. What do you do when a desire to believe overwhelms common sense and a preponderance of evidence? Experts presented seven techniques Mumler might have used in faking his photographs, then other experts attested that they had seen Mumler using none of them.The trial featured an array of extraordinary characters like Elbridge T. Gerry, Abraham Bogardus and Jeremiah Gurney. But in the end, it was P.T. Barnum whose testimony about \u201chumbugs\u201d may have saved Mumler from further incarceration and obloquy (not that he didn\u2019t suffer his fair share of the latter anyway). Barnum\u2019s equivocation about which came first, seeing or believing, cinched the deal for Mumler\u2019s acquittal. Manseau takes us inside the judge\u2019s head immediately after Barnum\u2019s testimony. \u201c\u2018However I might believe that trick and deception has been practiced by the prisoner, as I sit here in my capacity of magistrate, I am compelled to decide,\u2019 he added with a note of resignation, \u2018that the prosecution has failed to prove the case.\u2019\u201dManseau has created an exceptional story of how photography intersects with the hope that some heretofore unexplored scientific process will reveal something about the nature of man and our limitations. It is one of the persistent myths of mankind that death isn\u2019t final \u2014 that photography, which transcends time and space, can show a way around death.Several great moments in American history are mentioned casually, but we still feel their importance. There\u2019s the account of Abraham Lincoln selecting Brady to be his portraitist for the 1860 election. \u201cLincoln did not look much like a statesman as he stood in Brady\u2019s posing room. The photographer drew up Lincoln\u2019s collar to shorten the appearance of his neck, and determined that he could put his artists to work taming Lincoln\u2019s hair after the image had been developed. They also might smooth the crags in his face \u2014 whatever might be done to make him appear more presidential. As a final touch, Brady placed Lincoln\u2019s hand on a book, as if the future president were already taking the oath of office.\u201d Thereafter, Brady persuaded Mary Todd Lincoln to be photographed in March 1861. \u201cMrs. Lincoln thought she looked too stern and matronly, and that her hands were too big. As he had with her husband, Brady posed his nervous subject, finding the best possible angle with which to display her profile. He then carefully arranged her hands to seem more dainty.\u201d The result of all these artistic adjustments was immensely pleasing to the future first lady. \u201cHalf fantasy, half reality, it was one of her favorite photographs of herself.\u201d Perhaps most photography fits this description.I tracked down the source of Manseau\u2019s Kafka epigraph, that line characterizing photography as a tool of misrepresentation and tergiversation. It\u2019s in Gustav Janouch\u2019s \u201cConversations With Kafka,\u201d and the full exchange tells a different story. \u201cThe drawing is wonderful. It is full of truth,\u201d Kafka repeats again and again. Janouch, his interlocutor, asks: \u201cDo you mean that it is true to life as a photograph is?\u201d Kafka replies: \u201cWhat are you thinking of? Nothing can be so deceiving as a photograph. Truth, after all, is an affair of the heart. One can get at it only through art.\u201d Needless to say, I prefer Manseau\u2019s abbreviated version. It more accurately expresses my own sympathies with respect to photography.Because of an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Abraham Lincoln as a senator from Illinois in 1860. Lincoln never served as a United States senator.Errol Morris is a writer and filmmaker. His Netflix series \u201cWormwood\u201d will debut in December, and his latest book, \u201cThe Ashtray,\u201d will be published next spring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Warehouse Conversions Aren\u2019t Just for Cities Anymore. Or Just for Warehouses.", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetThe notion that old commercial buildings could enjoy a second life as places to live and work was popularized by artists in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood in the 1960s, when dusty warehouses started to give way to studios and apartments.And in the ensuing years, the trend seemed to play out mostly in dense urban areas, where tight quarters necessitated that residents be creative.Now, however, in an era when homes and offices seem to embrace industrial d\u00e9cor, such \u201cadaptive-reuse\u201d projects are turning up in more suburban areas, in a slew of building types, like power plants, churches, schools, prisons, railroad stations, hospitals and factories.Despite their growing popularity, the conversions can be complex, time-consuming and expensive, scaring off some developers. And projects can also risk a backlash: Plans for luxury housing in buildings that once employed entire neighborhoods may not sit well with every community.But as the market for conversions expands, developers are becoming inventive, as with two current New York-area projects.\u201cIt\u2019s great to see that somebody\u2019s finally doing something,\u201d said Nicholas Fortson, a 60-year-old Norwich resident, as he stood near the former textile mill site on a recent afternoon, preparing to kayak with his wife, Peggy. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201dTucked in the southeastern corner of Connecticut, in a region speckled with shuttered textile mills, Ponemah Mills, a collection of more than a dozen buildings on the Shetucket River, offers some striking sights.Its red brick, mansard-roofed main building, which opened in 1871, stands five stories tall and is graced with two cupola-topped towers that recall the spires of a cathedral. Yet it has been largely quiet since the early 1970s, when most major mill operations ended.Now, under an ambitious $98 million plan from a team led by Onekey, a New Jersey-based development firm, much of the complex is being reborn as the Lofts at Ponemah Mills.As part of the first phase, which is budgeted at $38 million, half of that soaring main building is adding 116 one- to three-bedroom apartments with tall ceilings and 10-foot windows. Also in that building will be a small museum about the mill, which produced cotton fabric, typewriter ribbons and wings for early-20th-century airplanes.In addition, Onekey has turned a separate structure into a gym with treadmills, a steam room and a sauna, alongside exposed-brick walls.It won\u2019t take a textile fortune to live at Ponemah, its developers said. Sixty percent of the units are being offered at below-market-rate rents, for those in certain income brackets, which works out to about $890 a month for one-bedrooms.Market-rate one-bedrooms at the building, which opens this month, are about $1,000 a month, developers said.Curious residents were calling the rental office to find out what was happening to buildings that many considered a longtime eyesore, he said. So many people were calling, about 20 a day, that Mr. Kingston had to set up a call center just to field their queries, he said.The building\u2019s warm reception in some ways masks a difficult past. After the company bought the site for $4.5 million about a decade ago, Finbar O\u2019Neill, Onekey\u2019s director of operations, struggled to find financial backers. At the time, Mr. O\u2019Neill wanted to build condos, a tough proposition in the middle of a severe housing downturn, he said.After investing $8 million to clean up the mill and preserve it, Mr. O\u2019Neill switched gears and reinvented the project as rentals, which helped qualify it for lucrative state and federal tax credits, especially because some of the units are considered affordable housing, he said.\u201cI think there\u2019s always been a demand for loft-living product,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. But, he added, \u201cthe older buildings are getting older and more dilapidated, and many of them won\u2019t likely be saved.\u201dOther reminders of the complex\u2019s past include rows of video monitors that flickered spookily in a guard tower and a solitary-confinement yard protected by a cage.But it was not always clear where fact ended and fiction began. As it turned out, a sign warning about \u201ccontraband\u201d had been affixed to a wall for a production shoot. Since 2016, the Arthur Kill complex has hosted \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d the popular Netflix drama, as well as shows like \u201cBlindspot,\u201d \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d and \u201cThe Sinner,\u201d said Warren Cohn, a spokesman for Broadway Stages.Though television shows could easily create a convincing prison using sets, they\u2019re increasingly seeking out authenticity, said Gina Argento, the chief executive of Broadway Stages, which is headquartered in Brooklyn.And cell-lined halls, Ms. Argento added, can enhance acting. \u201cI imagine it helps the actor get into the mind-set that they\u2019re in prison,\u201d she said of the property, much of which was built in the early 1970s as a drug-treatment center.Getting the complex up to speed was not easy. When Broadway Stages arrived in 2014 to use the facility temporarily before buying it, there was no power or running water, Mr. Cohn said. The property also needed to be secured for storing equipment, he said, adding that the company spent $3.5 million over two years on improvements.\u201cIt is a relief,\u201d Ms. Argento said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s done with, and it\u2019s an exciting time to move forward.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Broadway Stages must invest $20 million in the property in the next five years, or the state\u2019s Empire State Development agency can take back the property.The company is constructing a 12,000-square-foot soundstage in a gymnasium on the property; four other soundstages are planned. Broadway Stages has about 40 stages, in two locations in Brooklyn and Queens.Plans include constructing editing facilities in an office once used by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Later, Broadway Stages may open the prison to the public for the kind of back-lot tours common in Hollywood, Ms. Argento said.\u201cSome of the hottest tourist attractions in other cities are prisons,\u201d like Alcatraz in San Francisco, she said. \u201cThere is definitely intrigue around this property.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Populist conservatives are particularly hostile to big tech, given its size and pervasive influence, as well as its support for immigration rights and other causes that clash with their economic nationalism.Let\u2019s face it: Despite the impending tax plan rollout and the picking of a nominee for Federal Reserve chairman, Washington will still be largely talking about the criminal charges that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates face in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.Some of those conversations will concern Tom Barrack, one of President Trump\u2019s closest advisers, who has emerged as connected to the two men.

{"Headline": "How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose Situation", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But so what? Hasn\u2019t that always been the case?As the men who run Silicon Valley will be the first to tell you, a company\u2019s size doesn\u2019t matter here. For every lumbering Goliath, there are always one or two smarter, faster Davids just now starting up in some fabled garage, getting ready to slay the giants when they least expect it.Well, maybe not this time.The technology industry is now a playground for giants. Where 10 or 20 years ago we looked to start-ups as a font of future wonders, today the energy and momentum have shifted almost completely to the big guys. In addition to the many platforms they own already, one or more of the Five are on their way to owning artificial intelligence, voice assistants, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, home automation, and every other cool and crazy thing that will rule tomorrow.The best start-ups keep being scooped up by the big guys (see Instagram and WhatsApp, owned by Facebook). Those that escape face merciless, sometimes unfair competition (their innovations copied, their projects litigated against). And even when the start-ups succeed, the Five still win.Because today\u2019s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don\u2019t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition \u2014 they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.The small guys won\u2019t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don\u2019t have the whole game won.They said the Five\u2019s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five\u2019s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren\u2019t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.\u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019d say it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, \u2018Why won\u2019t Microsoft do your business?\u2019 Then six years later it was, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Google do it?\u2019 Now it\u2019s a combination of why can\u2019t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?\u201dMr. Levin\u2019s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller\u2019s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day\u2019s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.IAC\u2019s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie\u2019s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five \u2014 both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that\u2019s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys \u2014 for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms \u2014 because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.\u201cWe think that a smart voice provider will say, \u2018If I want to win at all costs, we\u2019ll go get the very best partner\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s us,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn\u2019t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It\u2019s not betting on their demise; rather, it\u2019s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.IAC\u2019s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. \u201cI think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia \u2014 whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.\u201cI\u2019m mixed as it relates to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers \u2014 and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.\u201dBut like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here\u2019s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.Advertisement"}

But not necessarily more wholesome ones \u2014 next year, he\u2019ll star as a half-demon in \u201cHellboy.\u201d\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve been interested in my whole career is exploring masculinity and what it means to be a man,\u201d Mr. Harbour said. \u201cThe sensitivity of a man, but also the violence and power that goes along with it.\u201dIn Season 2 of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d now streaming on Netflix, Hopper is living with the consequences of his newfound sensitivity. Nearly a year after helping rescue the 12-year-old Will Byers from the nightmare dimension known as the Upside Down (and possibly discovering a certain waffle-loving telekinetic girl who may or may not have been marooned there), an emboldened Hopper finds himself drawn deeper into the paranormal and into a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they friendship with Will\u2019s mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder).Mr. Harbour, 42, spoke by phone from Sofia, Bulgaria, on a bad-weather break from shooting \u201cHellboy.\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What sort of emotional arc can we expect for Chief Hopper this time?The first season was such a classic hero\u2019s journey. What I started to realize with the new one is, once somebody has this heroic moment, this kind of savior moment, the danger then becomes: What are the limits to your heroism? Maybe you start to try to control things that you can\u2019t control, or you start to think that you have powers beyond what you really have. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to find him in Season 2, sort of coming up against that reality.What\u2019s the dynamic between the kids and the adults on the show? Are the boys coming to you for life advice?[Laughs] Occasionally. And I will say, occasionally it\u2019s super embarrassing. They\u2019re becoming teenagers now \u2014 they\u2019re like 14 and 15 \u2014 and so of course there are girl issues and body issues. They want to know about girls or a little bit about sex. They\u2019re hormonal teenage boys, and I get it, I was that way, too, but I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s appropriate that I have those conversations with them. So I offer them little bits of advice and then generally go off and get a cup of coffee and wait until it dies down.You\u2019re like a cool uncle.Sometimes when they get a little out of hand, I also am the guy who\u2019s able to be on set saying, \u201cAll right, come on kids, let\u2019s get down to work.\u201d So in some ways I\u2019m a cool uncle, and in some ways I\u2019m like a nasty physics teacher.Did you have any initial trepidation about playing a supporting role on a show focused on kids?No, from reading the pilot I knew that Hopper was a great, great character that they would do justice to. One of the things going into Season 2 is there is a father aspect to Hopper, but I certainly didn\u2019t want to become the dad on \u201cFull House,\u201d or whatever, who\u2019s just a dad. Hopper gets to go do very heroic things, and he gets to have this relationship with Joyce \u2014 you get to see him as full-fledged human being, and that was really important to me.The interesting thing about my career is for years I was trying to do that thing of getting in shape and looking cool \u2014 I would look at myself in camera angles and think how my chin looked the best and all this stuff. And I really couldn\u2019t get that much work.Then \u201cStranger Things\u201d came along, and I had to really reinvest and go back to acting class and say to myself, \u201cO.K. I\u2019m going to throw my heart and my soul into this piece.\u201d And part of that was letting go of a lot of my narcissism. In that first scene [in Season 1], where he\u2019s shirtless, I had wanted to get all in shape, and this acting coach was like: \u201cCome on, this guy doesn\u2019t work out. Play the character. Don\u2019t play the five roles in front of the character, just play that actual character.\u201dAnd that was where things turned around for me. It was like, \u201cOh, people want to see real human beings,\u201d and I\u2019ve been cynical about that, and here I have this opportunity. And I really took it.Advertisement"}

I save the songs I like, and occasionally make my own playlists out of the ones I love. As with any machine learning algorithm, the more you use it, the smarter it gets.

{"Headline": "Hollywood\u2019s Most Decent Fella on Weinstein, Trump and History", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith...Tom HanksSANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 In 2006, when Tom Hanks wanted to get a story published, he sent it to his friend and sometime director Nora Ephron.Having had my own writing critiqued by her, I know just how daunting that could be.\u201cOh, petrifying, horrifying, yes, yeah,\u201d Mr. Hanks said, grimacing.The piece was a sweet paean to his makeup man Danny Striepeke, then 75 years old and retiring, a 50-year Hollywood veteran who had started by giving Elvis Presley his tan in \u201cViva Las Vegas\u201d and Laurence Olivier his Roman nose in \u201cSpartacus\u201d and ended by turning Mr. Hanks into a policeman, an astronaut, an Army Ranger, an F.B.I. agent, a Master of the Universe, a Slavic tourist stuck in an airport, Santa Claus and a Harvard professor of symbology.Hanks sent Ms. Ephron the piece \u2014 she got mail! \u2014 and asked, \u201cIs this a thing?\u201dI hesitate, wondering if now is the moment to break the news to Mr. Hanks: He has spent a decade honing his writing and, despite all the other acting and directing and producing he does, and despite being, as the historian Douglas Brinkley calls him, \u201cAmerican history\u2019s highest-profile professor,\u201d he has managed to squeeze in a book of fictional short stories called \u201cUncommon Type.\u201d And yet he\u2019s still going to be in Thursday Styles.But the man is on a book tour, so first I needed to explore his fiction.\u201cWere you trying to be Chekhovian?\u201d I ask.\u201cBoy, Chekhov just always goes right over my head,\u201d he replies.I confess that I don\u2019t really know what that means, either, but a bookish friend had suggested I ask.In profiles of Mr. Hanks, co-stars including Meg Ryan and Sally Field (Mama Gump) have made a point of saying that he is darker and more complicated and even more angry than you would imagine underneath that decent Everyman exterior, but he keeps it to himself.And it is interesting, given that Mr. Hanks and Rita Wilson are celebrated as the king and queen of Hollywood, that there is a strain of melancholy that runs through many of the stories about small-town characters.In one, \u201cA Special Weekend,\u201d a 9-year-old named Kenny is being raised by his moody father and brisk stepmother in a Northern California town \u2014 with a throng of siblings and stepsiblings \u2014 because his mother, a pretty waitress, broke up with his father when Kenny was little. He gets to spend a birthday weekend with his mother, who arrives in a cloud of perfume, with red lipstick that matches her red roadster.When Mr. Hanks was 5, living in Redding, Calif., his parents separated. His mother, a waitress, kept the youngest of the four children while Tom went with the other two to live with his father. He was playing with his siblings one night when he was told he had to go with his father. He was a cook who married twice more and Tom had lots of stepsiblings and lived with a lot of upheaval. \u201cBy the age of 10, I\u2019d lived in 10 houses.\u201d\u201cBy and large, they were all positive people and we were all just kind of in this odd potluck circumstance,\u201d he said, adding that he still vividly recalls the confusion of being that little boy. \u201cI could probably count on one hand the number of times I was in a room alone with my mom, or in a car alone. That is not exactly what happened to me, but there were times when either my mom or my dad \u2014 the same thing was true for both \u2014 in which being alone with them, I realized, was like, \u2018This is a special time.\u2019 For other people, it\u2019s not a special time. It\u2019s just part and parcel to the day.\u201dHe took Ms. Ephron\u2019s advice to heart. His voice is recognizably Hanks, with lots of Norman Rockwell phrasing: lollygagging, yowza, thanked his lucky stars, titmouse, knothead, atta baby.The title of the book is drawn from his love of vintage typewriters. There are 300 or so perched upstairs and downstairs in bookcases in the Santa Monica office of Playtone, his production company, which also boasts a turntable and enviable collection of LPs and 45s. We talk next to rows and rows of rare black and red and green typewriters that do not work but count as \u201cobjects of art\u201d for Mr. Hanks.There is also a glamour shot of Ben Bradlee, whom Hanks is portraying in \u201cThe Post,\u201d the Steven Spielberg-directed movie about The Washington Post\u2019s role in publishing the Pentagon Papers. \u201cBen knew he was the coolest guy in the room,\u201d Mr. Hanks says.In the adjacent room, bookcases are brimming with covered typewriters. Vintage posters of typewriters hang on the walls.\u201cTyping was the one requirement my dad had for me, going to school,\u201d Mr. Hanks recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018goddamn it, you\u2019ll take a typewriting course!\u2019 I think that was the sum total of my dad\u2019s advice to a young man.\u201dHe tried to write his fiction on a typewriter but concedes, \u201cI only made it about five pages in.\u201d That delete key on a laptop is too alluring.All different brands of typewriters \u2014 Royals and Remingtons and Continentals \u2014 make cameos in the stories, with pictures. It\u2019s \u201cThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs\u201d version of Alfred Hitchcock giving himself a walk-on in his movies.When I ask Mr. Hanks how he fell in love with typewriters, he tells the basic story in \u201cThese Are the Meditations of My Heart,\u201d noting, \u201cI changed the gender so they wouldn\u2019t all be about confused young men.\u201d It\u2019s a yarn about a young woman who finds a cheap typewriter at a church-parking-lot sale, goes to a Polish repairman to get it fixed and ends by upgrading to a Swiss sea-foam-green Hermes 2000, the Mercedes of typewriters, with an Epoca typeface.Did his stint on the early \u201980s sitcom \u201cBosom Buddies,\u201d in which he dressed in drag, \u201cSome Like It Hot\u201d style, to live in an apartment building restricted to women, help him write in a woman\u2019s voice?\u201cI\u2019m not sure that Lenny Ripps and Chris Thompson wrote in women\u2019s voices per se,\u201d he says with a smile, referring to the show\u2019s writers. \u201cI think between all the women that I worked for and with and gave birth to and married, they all had a great amount of input.\u201dThat character wants a typewriter because her handwriting is so bad. Mr. Hanks says that\u2019s his problem, too, that his handwriting is \u201chorrible, horrible.\u201dHe looks at mine and says it\u2019s just as bad, noting: \u201cIf you were up for murder, a handwriting expert would read it and say, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s guilty, look at the Ys versus the block Js.\u201d\u2019I am also curious if the futuristic story on time travel, in which a middle-aged man goes back in time and falls in love with a young woman at the 1939 World\u2019s Fair, was inspired by the fortunetelling machine Zoltar in \u201cBig.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cthat really came out of a desire to see the 1939 World\u2019s Fair.\u201dMr. Hanks eats a sushi lunch, casual in Uniqlo jeans, a James Perse black T-shirt, Ralph Lauren boots, a Filson watch with Smokey Bear on it, a David Yurman silver bracelet and a custom-made class ring from the \u201cSchool of Hard Knocks\u201d with his children\u2019s initials engraved (both pieces of jewelry gifts from his \u201cfabulous wife\u201d). He\u2019s also wearing a dark Lululemon jacket.\u201cDo not judge me,\u201d he comically instructs. \u201cWhat happened was that on Sunday, Rita said, \u2018Let\u2019s get out of the house.\u2019 I had to buy some workout clothes and we went into Lululemon and I saw this and it kind of fit, so I asked, \u2018Is it appropriate for men to wear?\u2019 They said, yeah, so I\u2019m wearing Lululemon.\u201dHe looks trim. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what happens,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen you finally understand you have Type 2 diabetes and start eating like it.\u201dI had read that he got diabetes from gaining and losing a lot of weight for roles, but he tells me: \u201cNo, I got it from a life of the worst diet on the planet earth. I just ate sugar and stuff all my life.\u201dAlthough he admits he\u2019s not \u201cimpervious to perks\u201d \u2014 going on private planes is \u201cliterally like crack cocaine\u201d \u2014 he said he didn\u2019t have any trouble writing about ordinary people beyond the Hollywood bubble.\u201cLife here is not like \u2018The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d\u2019 he says. \u201cNo one wears that much lip gloss 24 hours a day or constantly goes out to restaurants only to have arguments about \u2018You didn\u2019t invite me to your daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah.\u201d\u2019\u201cJust don\u2019t read the comments because nothing good can come out of it,\u201d he says. \u201cHave you ever had someone say, \u2018I read the greatest review of your book,\u2019 or \u2018the most glowing review of your movie,\u2019 and you read it and you say, \u2018That\u2019s not a glowing review. This guy takes cheap shots left and right and he didn\u2019t get the point.\u2019 Look, I\u2019m 61. I don\u2019t have time to read about how bad or how good I was at something. Just let it sit out there and they have to deal with the fact that I\u2019m the famous guy who got my name in the paper.\u201dI ask him if he\u2019s going for a Pegot (Pulitzer, Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony).He laughs and says that sometimes you just have to take a risk and be bad at something and get outside yourself and have somebody else critique it and throw stuff away and work harder and that\u2019s how you get better. \u201cI went through some things like, Well, it looks like a piece of writing. It\u2019s on a piece of paper with the right format. And it ain\u2019t.\u201dAs he told The Times Book Review, he\u2019s a big reader with stacks of books at home. Does that make him an oddball in Hollywood?\u201cI think they just assume here you\u2019re a Luddite because the coin of the realm right now is podcasts or obscure shows that are only on for 10 episodes on Hulu or Netflix,\u201d he says. \u201cThe dinner party conversation is, \u2018I read the most fascinating book about the Civil War\u2019 and they go, \u2018Hmm\u2019 and then they move on to some other conversation.\u201dHis favorite book when he was in high school was \u201cIn Cold Blood,\u201d by Truman Capote, but now he prefers Cold War spy stories by Alan Furst and Philip Kerr. He says he\u2019s not interested in murder or conspiracy stories. When he writes, he doesn\u2019t try to get into the head of a psychopath, just a surfer, like himself.I ask if, as the nation\u2019s designated most likable actor \u2014 even his Halloween monster on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d David S. Pumpkins, is cuddly \u2014 he felt pressure to make his fictional characters likable.\u201c\u2018Unleash the Charm Monster, damn it, that\u2019s all we want from you,\u2019\u201d he intones in the collective Hollywood voice. But he gets a bit defensive on the issue.\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of not willing to get dark,\u201d he says. \u201cLook, I played an executioner in a movie. Then the journalist says, \u2018Yeah, but you were a nice executioner.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t fun to play a guy whose job it is to put everybody to death. In \u2018Road to Perdition,\u2019 I played a guy who shot people in the head. And you know what they say? \u2018Yeah, but you shot him in the head for all the right reasons.\u2019 I\u2019m not interested to play a guy who is some version of \u2018Before I kill you, Mr. Bond, would you like a tour of my installation?\u2019 I like stories in which everybody makes sense, so you can hear their different motivations and understand them, as opposed to \u2018When this elixir goes in the Gotham City water structure, then the city will be mine!\u2019\u201cI think the best examples of a bad guy that I would jump to be able to play would be Richard III or Iago. I get that. Richard III is this misshapen guy who\u2019s sick of being treated like a dog and he\u2019s got a shot at being the king of England, and Iago lost out on a promotion. But the vast majority of bad guys \u2014 what am I going to do, play Loki? No one wants to see me do that. But I could play Jefferson Davis. The biggest thing I have to consider is: What\u2019s my countenance? I don\u2019t have a great deal of mystery.\u201dDoesn\u2019t he ever want to be like Larry David and start yelling at people on the street? It must be hard when everyone expects you to always be nice.\u201cI think I am! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI think I give everybody a fair shake. But I will tell you this, and there\u2019s plenty of people who can attest to it, don\u2019t take advantage of my good nature, because the moment that you do, you\u2019re gone, you\u2019re history. I mean, look, I\u2019m not a sap. I\u2019m not na\u00efve. At least I don\u2019t think I am. I understand that part of it is my nature, part of it is my DNA, part of it is the sum total of everything I went through, and it came out O.K. But part of it is a choice that just says, How do I want to spend my day? How do I want to spend these hours, pissed off at something or you just kind of let it roll off you. But don\u2019t take advantage of my good nature because if you do, it will come back to haunt you and you will hear from me in no uncertain terms. I\u2019ve yelled at people.\u201d Even used vulgarities.So now that we\u2019re on the subject of screaming and vulgarities, I segue into the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Talk about a Bonfire of the Vanities, Sherman.\u201cI\u2019ve never worked with Harvey,\u201d Mr. Hanks says, after a long pause. \u201cBut, aah, it all just sort of fits, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dWhy did Hollywood help shelter him, if everyone knew about the decades of abusive behavior?\u201cWell, that\u2019s a really good question and isn\u2019t it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?\u201d he says. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can\u2019t buy, \u2018Oh, well, I grew up in the \u201960s and \u201970s and so therefore. ...\u201d I did, too. So I think it\u2019s like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can.\u201dThey think their achievements entitle them, he says, noting: \u201cSomebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: \u2018When you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are.\u2019\u201cSo I would say, there\u2019s an example of how that\u2019s true. Just because you\u2019re rich and famous and powerful doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away \u2018fat.\u2019 But I\u2019m not, you know, I\u2019m not the first person to say Harvey\u2019s a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn\u2019t it kind of amazing that it took this long? I\u2019m reading it and I\u2019m thinking \u2018You can\u2019t do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don\u2019t do that. That ain\u2019t fair. Not her, come on. Come on!\u2019\u201dI ask him why Hollywood and Silicon Valley are still such benighted places about women\u2019s rights, with conspiracies of silence about raging sexism and marauding predators.\u201cLook, I think one of the greatest television shows in the history of television was \u2018Mad Men\u2019 because it had absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period,\u201d Mr. Hanks says. \u201cThose people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, \u2018Hey, wait, that\u2019s going on today? Shouldn\u2019t we be on this?\u2019 Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it\u2019s happening? I can\u2019t quite believe that\u201d \u2014 here Mr. Hanks uses an expletive \u2014 \u201cstill goes on.\u201dAs long as we\u2019re on the subject of Mr. Weinstein, a powerful, politically prominent man who got away with bad behavior toward women for an inexplicably long time, I bring up President Trump.Mr. Hanks says he just listened to the NPR show in which a former producer of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d admitted that the show made the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which was falling apart and, as Mr. Hanks says, \u201cstank,\u201d look glossy in an effort to sell the image of Trump, the successful businessman.\u201cAt the time, who cares?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a show about a guy. But in retrospect, that is what the official record is of a public figure that holds sway. Making this stuff up is dangerous, man. It\u2019s an absolute, total falsehood.\u201dHe says Mr. Trump squeaked through because people were tired of the \u201cBush-Clinton continuum\u201d for 30 years and political \u201cdoublespeak.\u201d He realized, even before the 2016 election, when Joe Wilson yelled \u201cYou lie!\u201d at President Obama during an address to Congress, that comity was gone.I ask Hollywood\u2019s top history buff, the man who sent the White House press corps an espresso machine after Trump\u2019s election because he knew they\u2019d need it (he did this for journalists covering the Bush White House in 2004, too): Is this the calm before the storm?\u201cLet me just read you one thing,\u201d he says, getting up to go into the other room and coming back with \u201cApril 1865: The Month That Saved America,\u201d a book by Jay Winik about the closing weeks of the Civil War: \u201c\u2018And where abolitionists preached slavery as a violation against the higher law, Southerners angrily countered with their own version of the deity, that it was sanctioned by the Constitution. In the vortex of this debate, once the battle lines were sharply drawn, moderate ground everywhere became hostage to the passions of the two sides. Reason itself had become suspect; mutual tolerance was seen as treachery. Vitriol overcame accommodation. And the slavery issue would not just fade away.\u201d\u2019He looks up. \u201cSomehow, sometime in the last 20 years of our generation, that\u2019s re-emerged. So, yes, this is the calm before the storm.\u201dI note that he savors the Philip Kerr character Bernie Gunther, a cynical Berlin detective who sees the Nazis for the beasts they are. Is he surprised the Nazis have crawled out of hell, marching in the open in Charlottesville?\u201cIn Germany, in some of the smaller counties, they\u2019ve got Nazis running for office,\u201d Mr. Hanks says. \u201cAnd jeez, we\u2019ve got Nazis giving torchlight parades in Charlottesville. Don\u2019t you hope that this is just some kind of doomsday fetishism\u201d that will soon die out?At a tribute to his career last November at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Hanks gave a soothing Sully Sullenberger-like speech about the election, with the theme \u201cWe are going to be all right.\u201d I ask him if he is sure.He replies that, except for some bone-headed amendments to the Constitution like prohibition \u2014 \u201cthat was so friggin\u2019 stupid, completely contrary to human behavior\u201d \u2014 America always course-corrects.\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve had a knot-headed president of the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have always corrected something that\u2019s horrible. World War II was fought by a segregated United States of America, except for a few military units. And immediately after that, it altered. But you have to go through things that will alter the consciousness. And normalcy is always being redefined and you just have to have faith and you have to have some degree of patience and you do have to put up with, every now and again, let\u2019s face it, Nazi torch parades surrounding a phantom issue of a statue that was put up in the 1920s.\u201dI ask where he stands on the removal of Confederate statues.\u201cLook, if I\u2019m black and I live in a town and every day I have to walk past a monument to someone who died in a battle in order to keep my grandparents and my great-grandparents illiterate slaves, I got a problem with that statue,\u201d he says. \u201cI would say if you want to be on the safe side, take them all down. Put them in some other place where people can see them, in a museum somewhere.\u201dMr. Hanks concludes about our rocky road to a more perfect union, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ugly periodically, but it\u2019s also going to be beautiful periodically.\u201d And he advises keeping a sense of humor.\u201cIt might be the only ammunition that is left in order to bring down tyrants,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know what Mark Twain says: \u2018Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand.\u201d\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roy Price Quits Amazon Studios After Sexual Harassment Claim", "Date": "2017-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, resigned on Tuesday, just days after a producer publicly accused him of sexual harassment, a spokesman for the company said.Just hours after the article was published, Amazon announced that Mr. Price had been suspended. Representatives for Amazon did not immediately answer inquiries on whether or not a broader investigation of Mr. Price has been conducted in the days since.The author of The Hollywood Reporter article, Kim Masters, previously reported for the publication The Information that an investigation had been conducted a few weeks after the alleged incident two years ago.The move followed the firing and Hollywood-wide denunciation of the mogul Harvey Weinstein, which resulted from the many accusations of sexual harassment and assault against him. (Mr. Weinstein, through his spokeswoman, has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex.)Mr. Price, a Harvard alumnus who once worked at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, had been an executive at Amazon for the last 13 years. He oversaw several TV shows, including \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Man in the High Castle.\u201dAmazon\u2019s original programming has not gotten the same buzz as Netflix shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d or Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which won an Emmy last month in the best drama category. Amazon was already in the process of trying out a new game plan for its original programming by time Mr. Price was suspended.Albert Cheng, the chief operations officer for Amazon Studios and the former head of digital operations at ABC, was assigned to be Mr. Price\u2019s interim replacement.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s talk about your socks.Marvin the Martian is one of the original Looney Tunes.Where did you find those?You\u2019d have to ask my sister. She buys all my socks.That\u2019s adorable. What about your shorts?Shorts are Calvin Klein, the shirt is from here. One of my clients is a member. He saw this shirt and said, \u201cThis is you.\u201dWhen you do life coaching, do you tell people to dress to stand out?No. Well, if they want to, yeah. What do you think of the uniform?I definitely like the navy and gray. I think they\u2019ve done a good job with the fit. Everyone has their own shoes.You do the Pumas?I do the Puma. There are guys who do FootJoy, Under Armor, Nike. Everything across the board. That\u2019s our own little flair.Did you change your pumas between the course and now?Yes, the shoes for the course are only for the course. These are street shoes.That\u2019s a great belt.I had to switch out for the American flag belt buckle. I feel really completed today.You came from Chicago for this?My girlfriend got me the ticket.What a nice present. You must really like golf.I do. I\u2019ve been playing for a while. My look has evolved from the big fluffy polo shirt and slacks. I\u2019m pretty relaxed today. I flirted around with the international team\u2019s color from a few years back. You look like you work out.Is your polo shirt small, or is it that you have big arms?This is a medium, so I\u2019m hoping it looks a little smaller.Thank you. Express has these. It\u2019s just a cotton blend.Are you into America?Tell me about your outfit.We haven\u2019t been to a Presidents Cup, but we\u2019ve gone to Ryder Cups before so I am used to the Europeans really dressing for the occasion. So I started Googling. What does one Google?I was looking primarily for the shoes, and then I just matched the rest up. I typed in \u201cflag shoes.\u201d They were perfect.And how did you choose your shorts?I started with the shoes, then got the socks. And these are just white normal shorts. Would you wear this when you\u2019re playing golf?I might wear the socks. But you have to wear a collared shirt. What do you think of the uniform Lacoste provided?I think it\u2019s nice. Our flag is yellow and teal. That\u2019s why we\u2019re wearing a lot of teal and matching it up with yellow jumpers to have that distinct look. What do you normally play in?I wear Cherv\u00f2, which is an Italian company, so very much Italian style: shorter sleeves and a lot of really high-tech materials.Tell me about your shoesShoes are something that\u2019s very much a part of our gear, it\u2019s almost like our equipment. I wear FootJoys. The DryJoys. I wear orthotics so I need a shoe with a little more supportWhat do you think of the course? There\u2019s all this wind.It a tough day to be out there, but it\u2019s the same for everyone. So it\u2019s going to be a mental battle as much as a physical one.You went with shorts.It\u2019s going to be hot. We\u2019re approaching 80 degrees. These are Reiss.Is there a rule with golf and how long the shorts need to be?I honestly wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a golfer.The polo shirt \u2014 is that an everyday thing for you?And you\u2019re doing the sweater around your neck. That was a mistake. It was cold this morning. Tell me about your wrist wear.The watch is IWC Schaffhausen. And the beaded bracelet I got on the subway. Ten bucks.Why did you go with those shoes?Because the grass is very soft and the shoes have a tread on them.Are they Gucci?Where did you get your blazer?I think it\u2019s Korean.What\u2019s on your hat?It\u2019s Ultra China. It\u2019s an electronic musical festival.Are you an EDM fan?Yes!Is this what you wear to play golf?No, not really. Real men wear pink.Yes. I also have two daughters. I end up wearing a lot of pink.Basic khakis \u2014 the uniform today.I don\u2019t know where these are from. I should mention that I\u2019m dressed by my wife. She gets all credit.They just appear in your closet.She gives me clothes. I try them on. If they fit, I give a thumbs up. The cigar. Is it a golf thing or an everyday thing?Golf thing. Very manly.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a participant in the Presidents Cup. He is Mike Weir, not Bob. The article also misstated his role in the tournament. He was a captain's assistant, not a player.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Electric Future, Waymo Documents, Uber: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina has said it will eventually ban gasoline-powered cars. France and Britain have set a date. California is edging that way, too.And the world\u2019s car companies are scrambling to prepare.But it is still unclear when the industry will be fully electric.\u201cThey wisely gave no time frame because, frankly, no one knows how the future will evolve,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the research firm Autotrader.\u201cIt\u2019s not a niche anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very broad-based. Many of these solutions have now reached the famous inflection point where the adoption starts to accelerate.\u201dAlphabet\u2019s self-driving unit, Waymo, has been fighting in courts for months to get access to a due diligence report that Uber commissioned before it bought Ottomotto, the autonomous truck start-up founded by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski.That report, compiled by the cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg, was made public on Monday. Waymo is using it to show that Uber was aware of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s attempts to retain and gain access to information taken from Google. It details a history of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s meeting with Uber executives while still employed at Google.According to the document, Stroz found 50,000 work emails from his time at Google on Levandowski\u2019s personal computer. Stroz also found texts between Levandowski and former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick about recruitment efforts and working with Uber\u2019s self-driving arm dating back to as early as February and March 2016 \u2014 just weeks after Levandowski left Alphabet and launched Otto out of stealth.After leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski said he found a data storage container in his house containing \u201csource code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars,\u201d according to the report, information that Mr. Levandowski said he downloaded as a matter of \u201chis departure from ordinary course of business.\u201dInvestigators also found evidence of photos of Google self-driving car designs, whiteboard sketches and pictures of hardware and electronic components stored on Mr. Levandowski\u2019s iPhone.Jo Bertram, the regional manager for Uber in Northern Europe, has announced her departure just as the new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is in London to meet with the city\u2019s transportation authorities over their decision not to renew Uber\u2019s license.Given some of our current challenges, I\u2019m also convinced that now is the right time to have a change of face, and to hand over to someone who will be here for the long haul and take us into the next phase. While I would like to have announced my move in smoother circumstances, I\u2019m proud of the team we\u2019ve built here and am very confident in their abilities to lead the business into the next chapter.Ms. Bertram, who will continue for a few weeks to help with the transition, has been a key contact between Uber and Transport for London.She has been involved in negotiating on a range of regulatory questions, from streamlining the licensing process to securing permission for new Uber services in London.Her directorship was terminated on August 30, according to a Companies House filing, a few weeks before TfL officially notified Uber about its license, although Uber told the press at the time that this was related to an earlier role change.The debate is heating up as Procter & Gamble edges toward one of the largest proxy votes in history, on Oct. 10.Mr. Taylor made another plea to shareholders this week via a video, asking them not to vote for Mr. Peltz.Nelson Peltz would seek to fundamentally change the soul of our company. He wants us to go to a holding company in 3 separate businesses. He said corporate R&D is a hobby. It\u2019s not a hobby. It\u2019s fundamental to our brands and the processes that make our brands.To get an idea of what the P&G trio might be grilled on, here are some of the questions drawn up by Bernstein:\u2022 On the one hand PG has said that Peltz\u2019s new structure would be too costly; on the other hand PG has said Peltz is trying to fire loads of people, especially in Cincinnati. Which is it? What, specifically, is so wrong with Peltz\u2019s org plan if many other companies are run this way too and have done better than PG over the past decade?\u2022 Didn\u2019t Meg Whitman benefit from activist Ralph Whitworth on her board at HP? Why is this different?Goldman Sachs is considering betting on Bitcoin, soon after JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon called it a fraud.Goldman, which is considering a new trading operation dedicated to digital currencies, would be the first blue-chip Wall Street firm to deal directly in this market, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. Although banks have looked at using blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, they have been wary of wading directly into the market.Goldman\u2019s effort involves both its currency-trading division and the bank\u2019s strategic investment group, the people said. That suggests the firm believes bitcoin\u2019s future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold.Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood executive and co-founder of DreamWorks Animation, is trying to raise money for a television start-up and he\u2019s doing it on a scale that dwarfs the kind of money raised by the likes of Facebook, Netflix and Uber.Virtually every large media and technology company, as well as several private equity firms, have shown some interest.Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s idea? Premium quality content in short form, like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with a narrative arc of 10 minutes.\u201cI would actually make the argument that one of the challenges for network TV has been that they\u2019ve actually busted the form by asking people to watch 19 minutes of commercial time inside of 60 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-two percent of your watch time is watching commercials.\u201d\u201cThis idea that Apple and Facebook and YouTube are now coming into Hollywood with these billions of dollars and are in fact going to change the enterprise of television is actually wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything new or different or unique.\u201dThe ad agency is preparing to lock horns with Bain Capital after the private equity firm launched a $1.3 billion tender offer for Asatsu-DK, Japan\u2019s third-biggest advertising agency and a long-term business partner of WPP.Just hours after Bain\u2019s offer was made public, people close to WPP said on Monday night that it did not intend to sell its 24.7 per cent stake in Asatsu-DK (ADK) at the \u00a53,660 price offered by Bain, as the tender \u201cseverely undervalues\u201d the Japanese firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Alias Grace\u2019: 20 Years in the Making, but on TV at the Right Time", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Atwood\u2019s correspondent was Sarah Polley, then best known as a Canadian child star from the Disney Channel\u2019s \u201cRoad to Avonlea\u201d and years away from becoming a screenwriter and director of independent films like \u201cAway From Her\u201d and \u201cTake This Waltz.\u201d Ms. Atwood declined. Obviously.\u201cShe was 17!\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she had the wherewithal.\u201d\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d now shooting its second season in Toronto, depicts a near-future dystopia where women are forced into surrogacy for a dictatorial elite. \u201cAlias Grace,\u201d meanwhile, is a six-part period piece based on the unsolvable mystery of a poor housemaid (Sarah Gadon) who either abetted the murders of her boss and his housekeeper/lover (Anna Paquin), or was sacrificed by Victorian moralists for being a little too free, a little too desirable.Both feature Ms. Atwood\u2019s unflinching eye on the constraints, social and literal, that have shackled women through history. As the stormy political climate continues to churn in the United States, the Canadian writer\u2019s two decades-old novels have landed like contemporary critiques: In \u201cAlias Grace,\u201d 19th-century issues of anti-immigrant sentiment, abortion and class warfare seem suddenly hot-button.\u201c \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 offers us a window into a possible future when women\u2019s rights are eroded. \u2018Alias Grace\u2019 offers a look at what it was like before women had any rights,\u201d said Ms. Polley. \u201cTo look back and forward is very important at this moment when women\u2019s rights are incredibly precarious and fragile.\u201d\u201cTo be a woman in that time, or any time, there are parts of your personality and responses to things that you\u2019re expected to suppress,\u201d said Ms. Polley. \u201cSo what happens to all that energy and all that anger? What do you do with powerlessness? The idea of having more than one identity, the face you show to the world and the face that\u2019s deep within, captivated me.\u201dWhen the screen rights came up for grabs in 2012, Ms. Polley pounced. She took a six-hour meeting with Ms. Atwood. \u201cShe understood that the ambiguity mattered most, but ambiguity is tricky on film,\u201d said Ms. Atwood. \u201cGrace was convicted as an accessory because she didn\u2019t tell. We never knew, and she never told. She acted as one of those blank screens onto which everybody commenting projected.\u201d Ms. Atwood approved of the filmmaker\u2019s ambiguity skills, and Ms. Polley paid out of pocket for the rights.But the delays continued: Ms. Polley had a baby \u2014 and then another one. She wrote while her daughters napped, but was forced to shelve the pages when a fire extinguisher fell on her head at a community center, giving her a concussion. \u201cMy brain goes slower now, so maybe what I\u2019m coming up with as a writer is richer,\u201d said Ms. Polley. \u201cOr maybe not. But I can\u2019t multitask anymore, thank God.\u201dAt first she tried to adapt it as a feature film, but not wanting to lose the book\u2019s density she decided on a mini-series. And coming from the D.I.Y. trenches of independent film, Ms. Polley didn\u2019t realize that for TV, she could have enlisted other writers to help with the scripts. Instead, she wrote all six episodes by herself and while doing so, decided not to direct. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t see it in my head,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are scenes I wrote that I have no idea how to shoot. I love this book, and I was not going to see it screwed up, and I thought I might screw it up.\u201d\u201cNo one else would\u2019ve asked me to do this but Sarah Polley,\u201d said Ms. Harron. \u201cBoth Sarah and I are interested in what is true and what is not true. I think she liked that a lot of my films have characters crossed with madness. And she knew I wouldn\u2019t try to make \u2018Downton Abbey.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to prettify but to really show a brutal, ruthless, class-driven society.\u201dThe CBC, Canada\u2019s public broadcaster, came on board immediately, but a partner was needed to hit the $25 million (U.S.) budget. Netflix, the fast-growing streaming service that is increasingly looking at co-productions to fuel its insatiable appetite for original content, signed on quickly.\u201cThey came in with a really clear vision and a lot of passion, and 500 pages written,\u201d said Elizabeth Bradley, vice president of content at Netflix.Last fall, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cAlias Grace\u201d were being shot simultaneously in and around the city. In November, at the industrial Toronto waterfront that\u2019s cluttered with film studios, Ms. Gadon and Edward Holcroft, who plays the young doctor trying to unearth Grace\u2019s memories, were seated in the drawing room of a Victorian manor, their \u201csession\u201d bordering on flirtation. Rain began to slam the studio roof, interfering with sound recording. \u201cWe\u2019re also under flight paths,\u201d Ms. Polley sighed, sitting near the monitor.Ms. Polley\u2019s first feature, \u201cAway from Her,\u201d was an adaptation of a short story by Alice Munro, perhaps the only Canadian author more famous than Ms. Atwood. But Ms. Polley never met the reclusive Ms. Munro. In contrast, Ms. Atwood weighed in on scripts and casting for \u201cAlias Grace,\u201d and spent hours touring the detailed sets with the production designer. She especially liked the \u201cbotulistic preserves\u201d in Mason jars in the basement cellar where the bodies were found.\u201cWe are at a moment in history when some parts of North America are trying to turn the clock back, and if they want to turn it back, what do they want to turn it back to?\u201d Ms. Atwood said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason the women\u2019s movement really started in the 19th century. If they do go back, they\u2019ll end up with [a woman] dying on a bloody mattress.\u201dViewers in Canada, where \u201cAlias Grace\u201d began airing in late September, have responded. The ratings for the first episode were the strongest fall debut for a CBC drama in the past five years.Ms. Polley, too, has felt the sting of backlash. She hasn\u2019t directed in five years or appeared in a film since 2010, choosing to spend time with her children and work selectively. But with so few female directors in the marketplace, she\u2019s conscious that some view her stepping back as an act of betrayal. At a party, Ms. Polley mentioned to a female critic that she was parenting, not directing, and the woman made a vomiting noise at her. \u201cThe choice I made freely is, I would like to be with my children as much as possible. I think it\u2019s a victory of feminism not a failure,\u201d she said.\u201cI got off totally easy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a moment before this one where anyone would have cared about what those women had to say, where those women wouldn\u2019t have been ridiculed for coming forward, where they wouldn\u2019t have been thought of as whiners or strident or angry.\u201d.Then she returned to Ms. Atwood\u2019s words about a denigrated Victorian housemaid, maybe framed for murder, or maybe pushed to it. \u201cThere\u2019s a line where Dr. Jordan says something like: \u2018I wonder how much sublimated rage she must have carried with her, this child harassed on every corner.\u2019 And I wonder, too. I don\u2019t just wonder about a domestic servant in the 1800s. I wonder about women in every single field, every single day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Streaming Halloween: Canon Classics and New Movies to Scream With", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThe less-good news is that these restorations are not yet available for streaming, but are likely to show up in time. The \u201cLiving Dead\u201d restoration is distributed by Janus, whose stuff is regularly featured on the Criterion Channel of the service Filmstruck and Kanopy. (In the meantime, if they show up at a theater near you, I implore you to go.)Filmstruck is actually an excellent site for vintage horror this Halloween. Earlier this month the service featured premieres of six 1940s horror movies produced by Val Lewton for RKO Pictures. Lewton was a novelist-turned-producer of first-class taste, wide-ranging imagination and remarkable resourcefulness. In emphasizing that taste, critics have risked giving his nine RKO horror movies short shrift in terms of their potency in the fright department.While some Lewton pictures are more conventionally \u201cthrilling\u201d than others \u2014 \u201cThe Curse of the Cat People\u201d (1944) is an unusual kind of sequel and features a tone more poetic than spooky \u2014 most of the movies still carry strong scares. In the original \u201cCat People\u201d (1942), the European immigrant Irena (Simone Simon), bride of a Norman-Rockwell-type all-American (Kent Smith) fears that her sexual awakening will turn her into a deadly feline creature. The scenes of Irena\u2019s romantic rival Alice (Jane Randolph) seemingly stalked by a panther through Central Park and at an athletic club are still among the tensest ever executed in film.Similarly, the director Jacques Tourneur, who was behind \u201cCat People\u201d and \u201cI Walked With a Zombie\u201d (1943) gets an enormous amount of scare-mileage out of the sound of dripping water, a train going over a bridge and, finally, a bolted door and some terrifying sound effects in a stage-setting scene from \u201cThe Leopard Man\u201d (1943). \u201cCat People,\u201d \u201cZombie,\u201d \u201cCurse\u201d and \u201cLeopard Man\u201d are all part of the Filmstruck package. The other two titles are \u201cThe Body Snatcher\u201d (1945) and \u201cBedlam\u201d (1946), both more horror-conventional in subject matter and star power. \u201cThe Body Snatcher\u201d is derived from the Robert Louis Stevenson story and stars both Boris Karloff of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Bela Lugosi of \u201cDracula\u201d fame \u2014 it\u2019s one of only six movies the horror heavyweights made together. A spectacularly ghoulish story of grave robbers and medical demonstrations in 19th-century Edinburgh, it builds to a dizzying pitch of delirium. So does \u201cBedlam,\u201d also starring Karloff, another grim period piece set in an asylum. Because the Lewton productions were low-budget pictures meant to fill out double-features, they\u2019re pretty concise, with not many reaching the 90-minute mark. As such, the lot can serve as terrific Halloween binge-watching.After which, if you remain unsatisfied, Filmstruck and the Criterion Channel have multiple offerings spanning the world and the 20th century. From Europe, they have F. W. Murnau\u2019s silent 1922 \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the first great vampire movie; Benjamin Christensen\u2019s \u201cHaxan,\u201d a fascinating 1929 quasi-documentary, both presented in beautifully tinted prints; Carl Dreyer\u2019s ineffable 1932 \u201cVampyr,\u201d a film whose influence is still felt today in the atmospheric work of directors like David Lynch; and Georges Franju\u2019s \u201cEyes Without a Face\u201d (1962), a French plastic-surgery thriller that strikes an unforgettable balance of grisliness and lyricism. From Japan, there\u2019s Kenji Mizoguchi\u2019s devastating ghost story \u201cUgetsu\u201d (1954) and the folk-tale derived shockers \u201cOnibaba\u201d (1965), about a pair of samurai-slaughtering women, and \u201cKuroneko\u201d (1968), about ghostly women and eerie cats. From North America, there\u2019s the spookifying regional classic \u201cCarnival of Souls\u201d (1962), the chilly Canadian family guignol \u201cThe Brood\u201d (1979) directed by David Cronenberg, and Guillermo del Toro\u2019s debut feature, the offbeat vampire picture \u201cCronos\u201d (1993). (On Oct. 31, \u201cThe Brood\u201d will be paired with \u201cSwallowed\u201d (2016), an extraordinary and scary short film by Lily Baldwin, whose work has a visceral power similar to Cronenberg\u2019s, but with an anxious female perspective.)The only disappointment I found in my explorations was that the site\u2019s print of \u201cSpirits of the Dead\u201d (1968), the Poe-inspired multidirector horror anthology, is in a French-language edition. This is fine for the first two segments, one directed by Roger Vadim, the other by Louis Malle; but the final segment, \u201cToby Dammit,\u201d directed by Federico Fellini and starring Terence Stamp, loses a lot of its disorienting (and funny) content when stripped of its original, Babel-like multilingual soundtrack and dubbed entirely into French. (The version with the soundtrack Fellini intended is not easily accessible in the United States, alas.)But wait \u2014 there\u2019s more. Several of the canonical Universal Pictures releases of the 1930s and \u201940s have made their premieres on the streaming video service Shudder this Halloween season. These are the big ones: \u201cDracula\u201d (1931), \u201cFrankenstein\u201d (1931), \u201cThe Mummy\u201d (1932), \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d (1933), \u201cBride of Frankenstein\u201d (1935) and \u201cThe Wolf Man\u201d (1941). These titles in some ways still constitute the rock on which the horror film was built. I can\u2019t recommend them enough.On Netflix I also enjoyed \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Candy,\u201d written and directed by Sean Byrne. In many respects the movie is a conventional please-don\u2019t-move-into-that-house item, but this story of an ambitious painter who transplants his family into a roomy albeit perhaps-Satanically-possessed new residence moves at a spanking pace and is rather droll in the way it plays with horror conventions, particularly those that associate heavy metal with the devil himself.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Mindhunter\u2019 on Netflix Is More Chatter Than Splatter", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe drama begins in 1977, the year David Berkowitz was arrested for the Son of Sam murders. Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff), a hostage negotiator for the F.B.I., is growing troubled by a trend that he sees in the field: criminals whose actions are irrational, who therefore can\u2019t be entreated with reason.When one negotiation goes awry, Ford\u2019s supervisor reassures him that he did everything by the book. So Ford goes looking for another book. He takes an interest in sociology on crime as a response to dysfunction in the larger community. The post-Watergate, post-Vietnam malaise, goes the theory, yields more inexplicable crimes. As Ford puts it: \u201cThe world barely makes any sense, so the crime doesn\u2019t either.\u201dThe sociologists he meets distrust the G-man poking around campus, but that\u2019s nothing next to the suspicion from agents at the bureau. They put up a moral resistance to learning how murderers think; bad guys, they believe, are just bad. (A similar dynamic played out this year in Discovery\u2019s \u201cManhunt: Unabomber,\u201d in which old-school agents refused to accept the idea that their quarry was highly educated.)Enter the mind of a murderer with these psychological tales of evil geniuses. See the full list at Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.He finds help in agent Bill Tench (Holt McCallany), a behavioral-science specialist. The series becomes a kind of scholarly buddy-cop tale, Tench, serving as skeptic and human-language interpreter as they crisscross the country interviewing cops and convicts for research.Apart from a grisly early scene, there\u2019s little onscreen violence. The talk is ghastly enough. In the title sequence, images of death flicker briefly on screen over the meticulous loading of a reel-to-reel tape machine. Mr. Fincher, who directed four episodes, gives \u201cMindhunter\u201d that restrained sensibility: micro-eruptions of primal blood through a facade of clean meticulous order.\u201cMindhunter\u201d was created by the playwright Joe Penhall, who wrote the first season with Jennifer Haley; the executive producers include Mr. Fincher and Charlize Theron. It\u2019s based on the memoir \u201cMindhunter: Inside the F.B.I.\u2019s Elite Serial Crime Unit\u201d by John Douglas and Mark Olshaker, and it can be stiff downloading the book\u2019s ideas into dialogue.The series is very much a boys\u2019 club early on. Hannah Gross has some screen time as Ford\u2019s girlfriend, Debbie Mitford, a grad student whose flirt-talk includes \u201cWhat do you think about Durkheim\u2019s labeling theory on deviancy?\u201d Anna Torv will eventually co-star as a behavioral psychologist.Still, the series\u2019 linking of irrational times and unspeakable acts resonates with today\u2019s stories of mass shootings and a widening gyre of chaos in the headlines. \u201cMindhunter\u201d doesn\u2019t aestheticize or elevate the likes of Kemper. But the notion that killers like him can be figured out and foiled is like placing a bet on reason over chaos.I say all this with what has become the usual caveat for a Netflix show. Streaming dramas nowadays take so long to establish their premises that I don\u2019t know if the two episodes I\u2019ve seen are representative or just setup. It\u2019s possible \u201cMindhunter\u201d may settle into a more predictable monster chase. Let\u2019s hope not; the chase after ideas here is more interesting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Good Vegan, Bad Vegan", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthI have no argument with people who adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet for health, religious, environmental or ethical reasons. But I object vehemently to proselytizers who distort science or the support for dietary advice offered to the more than 90 percent of us who choose to consume animal foods, including poultry and red meat, in reasonable amounts.Please understand: I do not endorse inhumane treatment of farm animals or wanton pollution of the environment with animal wastes and misused antibiotics and pesticides. Agricultural research has long shown better ways to assure the nation of an adequate food supply if only regulators would force commercial operations to adopt them.Nor do I endorse careless adoption of vegetarian or vegan diets for their name\u2019s sake. A vegan who consumes no animal products can be just as unhealthy living on inappropriately selected plant foods as an omnivore who dines heavily on burgers and chicken nuggets. A vegan diet laden with refined grains like white rice and bread; juices and sweetened drinks; cookies, chips and crackers; and dairy-free ice cream is hardly a healthful way to eat.Healthful plant foods like whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes, as well as vegetable oils, coffee and tea, received a positive score, while less-healthful plant foods like juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes and fries, and sweets along with animal foods were assigned a negative rating.The team, led by Ambika Satija of Harvard\u2019s Department of Nutrition, concluded that \u201cnot all plant foods are necessarily beneficial for health.\u201dThe more detailed Harvard study, which examined gradations of adherence to a plant-based diet, found that \u201ceven a slightly lower intake of animal foods combined with a higher intake of healthy plant foods\u201d was associated with a lower risk of developing heart disease.In other words, you don\u2019t have to become a strict vegetarian to protect your heart. Simply reducing your dependence on animal foods, and especially avoiding those high in fat, is helpful. In fact, \u201ca diet that emphasized both healthy plant and healthy animal foods\u201d was associated with a coronary risk only slightly higher than a diet based almost entirely on healthy plant foods, the researchers found.On the other hand, overdoing \u201cless healthy plant foods\u201d and less healthy animal foods like red and processed meats, the study showed, significantly increased the risk of developing heart disease.The Harvard findings lend further support to the most recently released Dietary Guidelines for Americans that urge people to consume large amounts of \u201chigh-quality plant foods,\u201d the researchers noted. They added that the recommended diet \u201cwould also be environmentally sustainable\u201d because plant-based food systems require fewer resources than those that rely heavily on animal foods.Thus, the more plant foods and the fewer animal foods you eat, the lower your carbon footprint and the less you would contribute to animal suffering. But to be truly beneficial, the plant foods you choose must be rich in nutrients.Although most Americans rely heavily on animal foods for needed protein, it\u2019s not difficult to get quality protein on a vegetarian diet that contains dairy foods and eggs. Pescatarians, who add fish to such a diet, get a nutritious bonus of healthful omega-3 fatty acids along with high-quality protein from fish and shellfish.Those choosing a strict vegan diet \u2014 one devoid of all foods from animals \u2014 face a greater challenge because the protein in most plants is not complete and must be balanced by consuming complementary sources, like beans and grains. A sandwich of almond butter or peanut butter on whole-grain bread is totally vegan and an excellent example of balanced protein in a high-quality plant-based diet. Vegans also must supplement their diet with vitamin B-12.I bet you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised at how much more delicious and varied your meals will be.Advertisement"}

Here are some spots around your house you should consider cleaning more often, if you clean them at all, because they\u2019re probably pretty filthy.Right out of the gate, we should point out that you should clean these spaces not because they\u2019ll make you sick or anything, but because they\u2019re probably pretty gross and collect dirt and dust easily. They may accumulate bacteria as well, but there\u2019s no reason to be a germaphobe about them.People with immune disorders or who are prone to sickness may want to pay closer attention than others, but in many cases, your cleaning efforts are just a good way to keep them in good working order for a nice long time.You probably don\u2019t think to clean off the doorknobs and handles around your home very often, but they\u2019re worth a quick wipe the next time you\u2019re cleaning in the same room. When you think about how often we touch the door knobs and handles in our homes, especially with dirty hands or on the way in or out of the bathroom, you may even choose to make a habit of it.Whether it\u2019s the handle to a kitchen cabinet, the doorknob to the bathroom or just the front door to your home, give it a wipe down from time to time, if for no other reason than to keep them free of debris and pleasant to use.For something we use for hours every day, when\u2019s the last time you did more than just wipe off your smartphone\u2019s screen when it was too smudged to see through? In reality, considering how often we use our phones, and where we use them (yes, that includes checking Facebook on the toilet), our phones deserve a more thorough cleaning from time to time.When you\u2019re not using your phone, you\u2019re probably using a desktop or laptop computer, which means your fingers are constantly in contact with your keyboard. And considering many of us snack or take lunch at our desks, drink over our computers, or even spill beverages on them, you can imagine the gross, grimy world living just below those keys.Even if you don\u2019t, flipping the keyboard upside down and shaking the debris out, then using a small hand-held vacuum cleaner or can of compressed air will do the job as well. Then a quick wipe down with cleaning wipes, cotton swabs or a microfiber cloth moistened with that same 1:1 alcohol-to-water solution we mentioned earlier will take care of the parts you actually touch.Be honest: Have you ever cleaned your remote control? Whether you use the one that came with your TV or something complicated that came from your cable company, odds are you pick it up every time you flop down on the couch to Netflix and chill.

{"Headline": "Would You Buy a Self-Driving Future From These Guys?", "Date": "2017-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhen the owner of an automated Tesla was killed in a crash last year, the carmaker\u2019s founder, Elon Musk, urged journalists to peer into the future.\u201cIf, in writing some article that\u2019s negative, you effectively dissuade people from using an autonomous vehicle,\u201d Mr. Musk said, \u201cyou\u2019re killing people.\u201dScary. But self-driving vehicle proponents like Mr. Musk envision a world where those cars would all but eliminate traffic accidents, unleash our productivity and allow the old and disabled to travel freely.Most Americans look at that future, though, and say \u2014 not so fast.It might be tempting for corporate executives and proponents to dismiss these concerns as part of humanity\u2019s aversion to change and argue that this resistance will soften once people see the benefits of self-driving technologies. That would be a mistake.Further, experts warn that the hype around automated cars is belied by the struggles these machines have in the rain, or when tree branches hang too low, or on bridges or on roads with faded lane markings.Lawmakers have to do better than that if they care about what the public is saying. A bill passed by the House last month would let manufacturers sell up to 25,000 automated cars a year without meeting all federal safety standards, and up to 100,000 cars after three years. The companies would not even have to establish that their cars are as safe as conventional vehicles before the number of exemptions increased.A bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee is a bit better. It would require a safety evaluation before raising the cap on exemptions. It would also limit the total number to 80,000.A larger problem with both bills is that they would do nothing to increase the size of the budget or staff of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is responsible for overseeing the industry and will have to write new rules for self-driving cars.Today, the agency is woefully unprepared to regulate self-driving cars, particularly at the scale proponents hope to see down the line. More electrical engineers, programmers and cybersecurity specialists who can evaluate such cars have to be hired.Among other challenges, the agency has to come up with standards for what happens when a highly automated car has to hand control back to a human driver. The results could be devastating if drivers are distracted because they place too much trust in their cars.There\u2019s no doubt that a driverless future would profoundly change society, even in ways we\u2019re not even considering yet. People might stop buying cars because services like Uber, once its cars are automated, would be cheaper to use. That could cause mass unemployment for taxi drivers and greatly reduce car sales, potentially hurting the economy. It would also make parking garages and parking spaces superfluous, freeing up valuable real estate.More people might decide to live, say, 100 miles from their workplaces because algorithms would make traffic flow more smoothly and allow people to nap, work or watch Netflix while commuting.Cities could be forced to put up barriers separating cars from pedestrians, who might feel emboldened to walk into traffic believing that cars would automatically stop for them.Automakers, lawmakers and regulators need to do more to perfect this technology, and reassure the public. There is a lot riding on that work.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Returns, More Familiar but Still Fun", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou could argue that Netflix\u2019s \u201cStranger Things\u201d was the spiritual sequel to \u201cE.T.,\u201d a scavenged-together pastiche of Spielbergian sci-fi laced with 1980s horror themes. Like \u201cE.T.,\u201d it seemed like a complete work that didn\u2019t need a follow-up. But it got one anyway.The good news is, \u201cStranger Things 2\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s called that, like a movie rather than a season of TV \u2014 is no \u201cNocturnal Fears.\u201d It does no harm. It doesn\u2019t betray the spirit of the first outing. But is it stranger? It\u2019s mostly \u2014 though enjoyably \u2014 familiar.The new season, arriving Friday, picks up just before Halloween 1984, and it spends its first half creating new versions of the first season\u2019s conflicts. Will is back in our world, but tormented by visions of the Upside Down, which, as the first-season epilogue suggested, still has a hold on him.Eleven, who went missing at the end of Season 1, is still in hiding. So Will\u2019s D&D buddies \u2014 Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) \u2014 find a new cool girl to be group-infatuated with, Max (Sadie Sink), and a new creepy-crawly menace to battle. As a new extradimensional threat arises, Mr. Modine\u2019s conspiracist scientist is replaced by Dr. Owens (a credibly straight-faced Paul Reiser).We\u2019ve put together a guide to everything you need to know before the nine episodes of Season 2 arrive.The new season\u2019s biggest strength is how it deals with Will\u2019s trauma. He\u2019s a frail kid who\u2019s survived a horrifying experience, and Noah Schnapp, in a bigger role, doesn\u2019t let you forget it. His lingering feeling of being unsafe in his own body is the show\u2019s most effective chiller. Ms. Ryder\u2019s role gets a little smaller as the story expands, but her fear of losing her son again, this time before her eyes, is just as convincing.For a breakout hit, \u201cStranger Things 2\u201d mostly refrains from milking fan-favorite elements. The death of Barb (Shannon Purser), who became a viral obsession, has continued repercussions (which occupy the show\u2019s teen characters for much of the season), but they\u2019re grounded in the story and characters.And while keeping Eleven separate from the action may be frustrating, credit the Duffers for resisting the temptation to turn the series, on the strength of Ms. Brown\u2019s transfixing stare, into \u201cThe Eleven Show.\u201dWhen the boys agree to go as the Ghostbusters for Halloween, there\u2019s even a sly comment on the racial dynamic of that movie and of \u201980s pop culture. Lucas, who is African-American, refuses to go as Winston, the black Ghostbuster. \u201cNo one wants to be Winston!\u201d he says. \u201cHe joined the team super late, he\u2019s not funny and he\u2019s not even a scientist.\u201dThe new season jokes about its own referentiality later, when Lucas fills Max in on the adventures of a year ago. She, of course, thinks he\u2019s made up a story. \u201cI really liked it,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt it was a little derivative in parts.\u201dThat would be a fair critique of \u201cStranger Things 2,\u201d which reprises many of Season 1\u2019s arcs and twists. (The ingenious device of having Will speak from the Upside Down via Christmas lights is replaced by \u2014 well, you\u2019ll see.) I\u2019m not sure \u201cStranger Things\u201d creatively needed a second season, and for several episodes it seems like \u201cStranger Things 2\u201d isn\u2019t convinced of it either.But it\u2019s a still a good time, it\u2019s nicely paced at nine episodes and it blends the suspense of \u201980s horror with the heart of an \u201980s teen romance. It may be last year\u2019s Halloween candy, repackaged. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t still be sweet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Disney\u2019s Iger, an Unlikely Political Turn", "Date": "2017-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. \u2014 Before the Trump presidency, who could have imagined that the Walt Disney Company would find itself at the fiery center of the American political debate?It\u2019s the Magic Kingdom. The home of Mickey and Minnie. Fairy tale princesses and Jedis. It gives us family-friendly Broadway musicals and endless hours of sports on television.Robert A. Iger, the 66-year-old chief executive of this entertainment giant, is starting to find his voice on matters having nothing to do with PG-rated blockbusters or amusement park rides. And he is emerging as a credible contender in the 2020 presidential speculation game.The entry of the mild-mannered Mr. Iger and his squeaky-clean company into the arena shows how President Trump has a way of drawing people and corporations once considered apolitical into the red-hot center.The first slogan for Disneyland, coined by Walt Disney himself, was \u201cThe Happiest Place on Earth.\u201d As the company grew into a global brand, it maintained its association with fantasy and fun by avoiding political turbulence whenever possible.No less surprising has been the leeway the company has given the talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, who holds down the 11:30 p.m. time slot at the Disney-owned ABC, to go after Mr. Trump and the Republicans.Ordinarily at these sorts of events, it\u2019s a chief executive\u2019s job to say just enough to promote his brand \u2014 but not enough to offend shareholders, board members, employees and customers.For Mr. Iger, who looked tall and fit in a crisp white shirt and navy blue cardigan, the talk was as much about hot-button politics as it was about how he intended to navigate cord-cutting and the rise of Netflix.It wasn\u2019t a \u201cyes,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t a \u201cno,\u201d either.I had the chance to catch up with Mr. Iger at a Vanity Fair after-party at the Bouchon Bistro, an outpost for the media and show business elite in Beverly Hills.I cornered Mr. Iger while he was sitting on a couch drinking a glass of white wine, as waiters delivered trays of lamb sliders and shrimp cocktail to a crowd that included Monica Lewinsky, the HBO chief Richard Plepler and Walter Isaacson, the Aspen Institute president and Steve Jobs biographer.He didn\u2019t necessarily agree with me, though he didn\u2019t quite deny it.He told me he had his limits, including with Mr. Kimmel, whose passion regarding guns and health care Mr. Iger said he appreciated. \u201cThat show is to entertain and, frankly, I understand him talking about Vegas, because that\u2019s where he grew up,\u201d Mr. Iger told me. \u201cBut I think he should be careful.\u201dHis own positions, he said, were mostly about business during these \u201chighly charged times.\u201d\u201cI took a position on immigration and DACA because of how it affected the company,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I took a position on climate change, actually the Paris accords, for the same reason.\u201dI have no idea whether Mr. Iger will run. It\u2019s probably too early even for him to know. But the speculation says something about the political moment \u2014 that during a presidency that lives and breathes in the media space, a major media executive is just as viable a White House challenger as any sitting senator.Mr. Iger may not ultimately run into the political storm. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t barreling toward him.Jaclyn Peiser and Susan Campbell Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bowing to the Inevitable, Advertisers Embrace Advocate Role", "Date": "2017-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, advertisers have striven to stay away from any topic that might prove controversial or divisive. Times have changed.That was a recurring theme during the recently concluded Advertising Week New York, an annual industry conference in Manhattan that has turned into its own global enterprise. (Next year, regional versions of the event will be held in Mexico City, London, Tokyo and Sydney.)The responsibility of companies, particularly advertisers, to advocate on social issues and to provide a moral compass in a fraught political environment came up repeatedly during the week.While appearing on a panel of chief executives discussing diversity and inclusion, J. Clifford Hudson, the chief executive of Sonic Drive-In, which franchises its restaurants and is based in Oklahoma City, said he has been stymied on how public to be about efforts made within his company after a report last year showed that more Sonic customers associated with President Trump than any other presidential candidate. That was \u201cto my surprise,\u201d he said, \u201cwith believe me, no effort on our part whatsoever.\u201dMr. Hudson said he was proud that most of his senior team is made up of either women or ethnic minorities but he has wondered, \u201cDo I do that quietly or do I become more public about it?\u201d He added, \u201cThe for-profit private sector is going to be playing a stronger role in the next number of years at trying to reset the bar, for fear that the bar shifts in such a way that it\u2019s not healthy for society.\u201dA separate panel focused on the representation of women in commercials and highlighted recent research from the advertising company J. Walter Thompson New York and the Geena Davis Institute that showed men get far more screen time in ads compared with women, who are less likely to be depicted as funny or even employed.\u201cPeople don\u2019t trust government and big authorities, they\u2019re looking for companies to take courageous stands and really do more good in the world,\u201d said Debra Bass, president of global marketing services at Johnson & Johnson Consumer. \u201cWe know advertising creates stereotypes which shape culture and it\u2019s our responsibility to change culture so more women will have education and economic empowerment and less abuse.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in an environment where, wherever you stand on the political spectrum, I think it\u2019s clear to all of us right now that we\u2019re looking to actors outside of our government to help drive the social justice agenda,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. \u201cTo be part of an organization like ours and in this partnership with the N.F.L. is allowing us to start to do that.\u201dBoth companies have been smarting lately. Major brands like AT&T and Coca-Cola pulled ads from YouTube earlier this year after they were discovered on videos promoting offensive content like hate speech. More recently, Facebook disclosed that Russians had used fake accounts and online ads to fan divisive issues during the presidential campaign. The social network has also had to respond to the revelation that advertisers were able to target users who used terms like \u201cJew hater\u201d to describe themselves.Still, video is too enticing for issues like those to scare advertisers away.\u201cYou just have what I would actually liken to a gold rush in the content space,\u201d Rob Master, vice president of global media, categories and partnerships at Unilever, which owns brands like Dove soap and Lipton tea, said during a presentation. \u201cThe amount of money pouring into producing and developing content is unbelievable,\u201d he said, naming Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Fox and Hulu.Marketers are watching that, as well as how younger generations are using their smartphones, and figuring out where they might fit in, he said.\u201cWhat is the commercial model for a video on a phone or on the web across these different platforms?\u201d Mr. Master said. \u201cToday, some platforms call video what I would call a digital moving billboard. So how do we think about that in terms of media \u2014 how do you plan or buy for that?\u201dThere were also, of course, discussions that did not touch on seismic industry or societal shifts.During a panel on Instagram, the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, who sells goods under a namesake label, described how she decides to make work-related posts to her highly-followed account.\u201cI feel sort of honor-bound to the people who follow me to not exploit the relationship, not to trade on the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel better talking about the business on our business pages frankly.\u201d But when it does happen, she said, \u201cI try to be very thoughtful and plot out those occasions where I invade the personal with business.\u201dImran Khan, Snap\u2019s chief strategy officer, said that Snapchat users were creating more than three billion pictures and videos a day.\u201cThe problem with text is that text never captured your true voice \u2014 text might grab your attention but it never captured your imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, the way we communicate is changing, it\u2019s becoming visual. With texting, I always had to translate my feelings over text. Now with camera, I can do that instantly.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the announcement of a settlement between the California attorney general\u2019s office and Gatorade.

{"Headline": "David Letterman Earns Mark Twain Prize for Late-Night High Jinks", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was all because of a 1978 appearance on Johnny Carson\u2019s \u201cTonight Show,\u201d the story goes, that David Letterman found his audience.Mr. Letterman, an unknown stand-up comedian then, appeared relaxed and confident telling jokes in a short set, then bantering in the guest chair next to Mr. Carson\u2019s desk. Landing on the show, and earning Mr. Carson\u2019s approval, meant he had made it.\u201cI have a feeling with your shot on this show tonight,\u201d Mr. Carson said at the end of Mr. Letterman\u2019s segment, \u201cthat you\u2019re going to be working a lot outside of the Comedy Store,\u201d referring to the West Hollywood club that was a haven for young comics.One place Mr. Letterman would go \u2014 39 years later \u2014 was the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where on Sunday he accepted the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, one of comedy\u2019s top honors. While collecting the award, Mr. Letterman referred to his timely visit on Mr. Carson\u2019s show, which was played on a screen during the award ceremony.After hosting more than 6,000 episodes of late-night television on NBC and CBS, Mr. Letterman left CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d in 2015 and eased into a private life mostly away from cameras. On Sunday in the building\u2019s orchestra hall, he sat perched in a box overlooking the stage, between his wife and teenage son.During his 33 years as a late-night host, Mr. Letterman was known for being at once breezy and detached, a contrast that made him a towering figure to the comedians who delivered tributes on Sunday.\u201cNo one from his generation influenced American comedy more,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, the host of ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d and one of Mr. Letterman\u2019s most famous adherents.Other speakers were just as gushing.\u201cMr. Letterman reinvented the late-night talk show,\u201d Norm Macdonald said. \u201cMr. Letterman deconstructed television itself, then created his own construct.\u201dJohn Mulaney described Mr. Letterman as the comic equivalent of the painter who broke from a tradition of religious art to paint fruit.\u201c\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 with Johnny Carson, I think it said to people: Hey, take a break from your weird life and watch these fancy people make show business,\u201d Mr. Mulaney said. \u201cBut David Letterman\u2019s shows said to people: Your weird life is just as funny as show business.\u201dSoon after, as if to prove Mr. Mulaney\u2019s point, Bill Murray, last year\u2019s recipient of the Mark Twain Prize, appeared at the side of the auditorium dressed in a Tudor-like costume, describing the kingly life that followed his acceptance of the award.\u201cWhat a reign it has been,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly a god, but you\u2019re way up there.\u201dThe show seemed particularly suited to the sweep and variety of late-night television, and to Mr. Letterman\u2019s brand of irony-soaked humor. The onstage tributes were separated by video segments from Mr. Letterman\u2019s shows, many featuring him away from his desk chair: working as a drive-through operator at Taco Bell, or playing with pet animals that performed tricks, or dropping objects onto a trampoline from a building.Mr. Letterman\u2019s longtime sidekick as a late-night host, the musician Paul Shaffer, joked in his tribute about Mr. Letterman\u2019s signature mix of warmth and reserve.\u201cI believe that Dave would run into a burning house to save my children,\u201d Mr. Shaffer said. \u201cAnd I hope and know, Dave, that I would do the same for you, should you some day feel comfortable enough to tell me where your house is.\u201dHis hobbies in television retirement have veered into less cerebral pursuits, too.Something else Mr. Letterman has groomed in his post-television life: a beard that has become a token of his new life. It was a constant presence \u2014 almost a second guest of honor \u2014 on Sunday, a hairy punching bag for his admirers.\u201cDave has always had spot-on comedic instincts,\u201d said Steve Martin, who won the Mark Twain Prize in 2005. \u201cWhat better time than right now to insist on looking like a Confederate war general?\u201d\u201cDave is incredibly accomplished,\u201d Amy Schumer said. \u201cOver the course of his life, he has successfully transitioned from a stand-up comic to a late-night talk show host to a Civil War re-enactor.\u201dThe Mark Twain Prize has been awarded since 1998, when Richard Pryor was its first recipient. A broadcast of Sunday\u2019s ceremony will air on PBS on Nov. 20.\u201cBecause of this award,\u201d Mr. Letterman said at the end of the show, \u201cI am now the most humorous person in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Jump-Start Your Career", "Date": "2017-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt happens to all of us: We hit a point in our careers where we start to wonder, Where is this all leading? What\u2019s next? Am I even doing what I want to be doing? Should I quit everything and try to become a SoulCycle instructor?! (O.K., maybe that one is just me.)I\u2019ve been at the same job for a while and it\u2019s going well, but how do I figure out a broader vision for my life and work toward it?There\u2019s really just one way to figure things out: \u201cDeep, serious and extended reflection, maybe with a blank sheet of paper or two (no screens!),\u201d Adam said.He suggests being honest about what it is you truly want in life \u2014 what kind of lifestyle, how much money you want to make, what excites you \u2014 and working backward from there.How do I know when I should leave a job?\u201cIf you\u2019ve done your current job well, contributed to the team and learned a lot from it, and you\u2019re feeling like you want to shed your skin and do something new, then it\u2019s time to start looking,\u201d Adam wrote.Even lateral moves can help to re-energize you if you\u2019re thinking about changing things up. And, just because we\u2019ve all thought about it: Yes, sometimes taking a salary cut for the right opportunity can pay off in the long run, provided it will set your career in the right direction.Adam ended by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s always better to run to something (an exciting new opportunity) rather than just doing anything to escape a job you don\u2019t like.\u201dWhat can an introvert do to make opportunities for advancement?Two things: Let your work speak for itself, and push yourself a bit to raise your profile, even if that\u2019s something as low-key as a one-on-one meeting or a lunch. This is a difficult truth for some introverts to swallow, but it\u2019s something you\u2019ve just got to do. Otherwise, \u201cthe show ponies of the world will get more attention than a workhorse like yourself,\u201d Adam wrote.Any tips for being better at interviews?This shouldn\u2019t surprise you, but Adam\u2019s main advice is to practice, practice, practice. Study up as much as possible on the company you\u2019re interviewing at, in addition to the specific people who will be interviewing you. It can help to make personal connections with them.And you know that part of the interview when they ask you what questions you have for them? That\u2019s your time to shine. \u201cDo your homework on the company and its culture, and ask really incisive questions,\u201d Adam said.Have a great week!\u2014TimAdvertisement"}
