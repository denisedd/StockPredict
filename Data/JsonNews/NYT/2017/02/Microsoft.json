{"Headline": "IBM Gives Watson a New Challenge: Your Tax Return", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its first steps toward commercialization, IBM\u2019s Watson took on grand, science-laden challenges like helping doctors diagnose cancer. But that is changing as IBM strives to build its artificial intelligence technology into a multibillion-dollar business.Today, companies including Geico, Staples and Macy\u2019s are adding the Watson technology to answer customer questions or to improve mobile apps that guide shoppers through stores.Now in its broadest deployment so far, Watson will be assisting H&R Block\u2019s 70,000 tax professionals this filing season at 10,000 branch offices across the country, where 11 million people file taxes.The H&R Block partnership with Watson, announced on Wednesday, is being presented to a wider audience with a 60-second television ad during the Super Bowl on Sunday.For IBM, the collaboration with H&R Block underlines its strategy in the emerging market for artificial intelligence technology. Watson will touch consumers, but through IBM\u2019s corporate clients.\u201cWatson will become a really smart, virtual assistant,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president of IBM\u2019s Watson business.The embedded-in-business formula is different from the path other technology companies are taking with digital assistants powered by artificial intelligence. Others are pursuing the broad consumer market directly with artificial intelligence software helpers like Siri from Apple, Cortana from Microsoft, Alexa from Amazon and Assistant from Google.In the corporate technology market, the major companies are racing to get on the artificial intelligence bandwagon, though they lack the early lead and powerful branding of Watson.Data-fueled artificial intelligence will be an ingredient in all kinds of software used in corporations, to streamline work, identify new customers, spot savings and guide product development, analysts say. By 2018, the research company IDC predicts that 75 percent of new business software will include artificial intelligence features.\u201cA.I. is becoming part of the mix, part of the infrastructure in consumer and business applications,\u201d said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.IBM is also banking on Watson as an engine of its corporate transformation. The company needs its new businesses like Watson, data analysis and cloud computing to more than make up for the erosion in its traditional hardware and software products.That has not happened yet. Two weeks ago, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarter of declining revenue.But there were encouraging signs in the last quarter of 2016.IBM executives noted that the company\u2019s newer businesses, including Watson, grew by 14 percent to represent 41 percent of total revenue. That was ahead of IBM\u2019s previous forecast that the 40 percent of revenue threshold would not be reached until 2018.But when Bill Cobb, chief executive of H&R Block, contacted IBM last summer, saying he wanted to use Watson to help \u201creinvent the retail experience for taxpayers,\u201d he heard what he called a candid assessment, not a sales pitch.\u201cThis is not magic,\u201d Mr. Cobb said the Watson team told him. \u201cYou have to teach Watson over time.\u201dWatson proved to be a quick learner. Its core skill is its ability to digest and classify vast amounts of text, using what is known as natural language processing. So, among other things, it was fed the 74,000 pages of the federal tax code and thousands of tax-related questions culled from H&R Block\u2019s data, accumulated over six decades of preparing tax returns.Then, H&R Block tax professionals were brought in to \u201ctrain\u201d Watson. They approved when Watson suggested a smart question for a particular tax filer and corrected it when a proposed question was off base. The tax professionals were not told they were working with Watson, just a software program.The technology was tested in about 100 H&R Block offices in January, and it will be available throughout the company\u2019s retail network next week. One goal, Mr. Cobb said, is to assist H&R Block\u2019s tax professionals and improve their chances of fairly increasing refunds and reducing tax liabilities for clients. Seventy-five percent of Americans who file taxes get money back. For H&R Block clients, the figure is about 85 percent, Mr. Cobb said.But Watson\u2019s other task was to make visiting H&R Block a more \u201cengaging and interactive\u201d experience, he said. Clients will be able to watch suggestions and questions on a separate screen, as the Watson-assisted tax professional works.Mr. Cobb said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with Watson\u2019s performance in the 100-office trial. But the test will come after this tax season, when H&R Block sees what percentage of customers return next year.The retention rate is crucial in the tax-preparation business. Sixty percent of the 140 million Americans who file taxes seek help instead of doing them themselves. Kartik Mehta, an analyst at Northcoast Research, estimates that H&R Block\u2019s retention rate is 75 percent. \u201cIf they can get that 75 percent up to 80 percent, it\u2019s a big deal for H&R Block,\u201d Mr. Mehta said.The Watson collaboration is a \u201clong-term partnership,\u201d Mr. Cobb said. Mr. Kenny of IBM described this tax season as \u201cphase one\u201d of the partnership.Over time, Watson\u2019s suggestions get better and better, more individually tailored to specific occupations, household finances and personal circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s crawl, walk, run learning,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cBut the pace of the Watson learning is so much faster than humans.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

Trained as a civil engineer, he got his start in business from his father, who had a successful construction company. He shifted the focus of his father\u2019s company to real estate and then turned his eye to luxury goods. Through his Groupe Arnault, the silver-haired Parisian sits at the helm of the luxury goods companies Christian Dior and LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. He is also a major art collector, having acquired works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol.His vast wealth sits predominantly in companies he controls. He has $34.8 billion held among Christian Dior, LVMH and Carrefour, a French retail chain. The next largest distribution is in cash at $2.9 billion; this is money from salaries, dividends and holdings that give him liquidity when he needs it. Then come the homes. He has a mansion in Paris worth $55 million and a home in the Bahamas worth $30 million, as well as yachts and art. His wealth shows how a single concentrated position in a company can increase your worth tremendously.Steven A. Ballmer, 60, scored a perfect 800 on the mathematics portion of the SAT and punched his ticket from an elite private school in Detroit to Harvard University. In his sophomore year, he lived in the same dorm as Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft. In 1980, he dropped out of Stanford University\u2019s business school to start working for Mr. Gates. He was paid $50,000 but given a stake in the nascent company. He rose to become chief executive in 2000 \u2014 a post he held for nearly 14 years. Shortly after stepping down, he bought the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team for a record $2 billion. The team had been mired in controversy with a previous owner, Donald Sterling.Even though Mr. Ballmer left Microsoft, the vast bulk of his wealth remains in company stock \u2014 $21.4 billion. He has $7.3 billion more in cash. It makes his stake in the Clippers seems paltry. He also has $450 million in Twitter shares. He owns a $14 million home in Hunts Point, Wash., and properties on Whidbey Island worth about $4 million.Susanne Klatten, 54, the richest woman in Germany, can trace the source of her wealth to \u201cthe ultimate driving machine,\u201d BMW. Her grandfather founded an industrial conglomerate that owned the German automotive company \u2014 and had a stake in its more staid rival, Daimler-Benz. The company also owned the chemical giant Altana. Her father, Herbert Quandt, took over the family businesses when his father died in 1954. When he died in 1982, Ms. Klatten received stakes in BMW and Altana, of which she is now the sole owner. As her father was credited with saving BMW from bankruptcy, she is credited with making Altana a top company in Germany. She is also chairwoman of the SGL Group, which produces graphite and carbon-fiber products.Her wealth is tied up in her companies, with over half, or $12.1 billion, in the BMW Group. An additional 16 percent is in Altana, and 1 percent is in the SGL Group. She has 22.5 percent in cash. She has a family office that creates privacy around the breakdown of her wealth.Azim Premji, 71, was born into the family that started Western India Vegetable Products, which produced hydrogenated oils. When Mr. Premji was at Stanford University, his father, who started the company, died, and he left college to take it over. At 23, he became chief executive. He diversified the Mumbai-based company\u2019s offerings into soap and baby care products. In 1981, he ventured into information technology. The company boomed through the 1980s and \u201990s, and in 2000 the renamed Wipro went public in New York. In 2009, Mr. Premji handed over the day-to-day running of the company. He devotes time to philanthropy, having given half his Wipro shares to a charity that supports education and health causes in India.His wealth appears to remain fairly concentrated, with 64 percent of it in Wipro shares. An additional 13 percent is in a related company, Wipro Enterprises, and 20 percent is shielded by his family office. Public records show that he has a $20 million stake in JM Financial (about 0.2 percent of his wealth), $180 million in cash and $1 million in property in Mumbai. Given his total worth, his properties and holdings are probably much greater, but he has structured his wealth to protect his privacy.Carlos Alberto Sicupira, who turns 69 this year, hails from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, which ranks just behind New York City (where he keeps a residence) for the most billionaires in the Americas. He began his career in finance at Banco de Investimentos Garantia. He later served as chief executive of Lojas Americanas, a Brazilian shopping chain. He is a founder of 3G Capital, a private equity firm that has become known in recent years for partnering with Warren E. Buffett, the second-wealthiest man in the world, on deals like the acquisition of Heinz in 2013 and, two years later, its merger with Kraft.Much of Mr. Sicupira\u2019s wealth rests in a series of deals 3G did with breweries starting in 1999. He has a $5.8 billion stake in the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev, which accounts for nearly 67 percent of his wealth. He has nearly $1 billion more in 3G itself. He still holds a $220 million stake in Lojas Americanas, where he remains chairman. He has an additional $1.6 billion in cash and a $2.5 million apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.Shari Arison, 59, was born in New York but splits her time now between Tel Aviv and Miami. Her father, Ted Arison, started Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. In 1990, he moved back to Tel Aviv, where he was born, and established Arison Investments. It later acquired Bank Hapoalim, Israel\u2019s largest bank, and renamed itself the Arison Group. It has investments in finance, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and water. When her father died in 1999, Ms. Arison inherited 35 percent of his wealth. (She has a brother, Micky, who owns the Miami Heat basketball team.) As owner of the Arison Group and a philanthropist, she promotes good deeds. The investment group\u2019s motto is \u201cDoing good is good for business,\u201d and through her charity she has sponsored Good Deeds Day, which encourages people to volunteer.Ms. Arison\u2019s wealth is divided fairly evenly among different investments. She owns $1.6 billion of stock in Carnival Cruise Line, $1.6 billion of stock in Bank Hapoalim, $1.1 billion in the Arison Group itself and holds $1 billion in cash. She has a stake in an Israeli housing and infrastructure company and homes in the Bal Harbour section of Miami and in Tel Aviv.Ever worn Nike, Adidas, Puma or Uniqlo? Those items may have come from one of Ma Jianrong\u2019s factories. His company is the leading textile manufacturer in China. Mr. Ma, 52, began working in the textile industry as a teenager and later earned a master\u2019s degree from Zhejiang University of Technology. His father, Ma Baoxing, was chairman of the weaving company that became Shenzhou International Group Holdings. In the late 1990s, the younger Mr. Ma took over the company and increased its revenue and net profit by 23 times in seven years. A member of the Chinese Communist Party, he is an official in the Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Congress.The exact composition of his wealth is hard to determine. He seems to have about $340 million in cash, with the rest in Shenzhou International Group Holdings.Patrice Motsepe, 55, was born in Johannesburg and began his career as a lawyer with American firms in South Africa. He attended university and law school during the apartheid era and practiced law for six years, becoming the first black partner in a South African law firm. In 1994, after Nelson Mandela became the country\u2019s first black president, Mr. Motsepe quit law to start Future Mining, a mining services company. With that as his start, he began acquiring mines and other mining companies. By 2004, the accumulated entities became African Rainbow Minerals. He owns the Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club, a soccer team in South Africa\u2019s premier league, and last year he started a private equity firm and financial services company.His wealth, which places him among South Africa\u2019s richest people, is well diversified. The largest portion of his wealth, 36 percent, is in cash and its equivalents. He has nearly 30 percent in Africa Rainbow Minerals, and a similar amount in Sanlam, a financial services firm of which he is deputy chairman. Some 5 percent of his wealth is in the Harmony Gold Mining Company. Two homes are worth $7 million, or one-third of 1 percent of his wealth.In search of quick Chinese food? Panda Express, with its 1,900 locations around the United States, is there to serve some up. Peggy Cherng, 69, founded the chain with her husband, Andrew. When the restaurant began expanding from Glendale, Calif., into the full-fledged chain it is today, she used her science background to make the business tech-savvy early on and then applied her knowledge of logistics to streamline the process. Ms. Cherng, who was born in Myanmar (then Burma), was raised in Hong Kong and met her husband at Baker University in Kansas. She holds a master\u2019s degree in computer science and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, and began her career at the defense contractor McDonnell Douglas. She and her husband live in California.Her largest holding is in the Panda Restaurant Group, which also owns Panda Inn. It is worth $1.2 billion, or 77 percent of her wealth.

{"Headline": "For Marketers, TV Sets Are an Invaluable Pair of Eyes", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Ellen Milz and her family were watching the Olympics last summer, their TV was watching them.Ms. Milz, 48, who lives with her husband and three children in Chicago, had agreed to be a panelist for a company called TVision Insights, which monitored her viewing habits \u2014 and whether her eyes flicked down to her phone during the commercials, whether she was smiling or frowning \u2014 through a device on top of her TV.\u201cThe marketing company said, \u2018We\u2019re going to ask you to put this device in your home, connect it to your TV and they\u2019re going to watch you for the Olympics to see how you like it, what sports, your expression, who\u2019s around,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Whatever, I have nothing to hide.\u2019\u201dMs. Milz acknowledged that she had initially found the idea odd, but that those qualms had quickly faded.\u201cIt\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d she said, comparing it to the Nest security cameras in her home. She said she had initially received $60 for participating and an additional $230 after four to six months.TVision \u2014 which has worked with the Weather Channel, NBC and the Disney ABC Television Group \u2014 is one of several companies that have entered living rooms in recent years, emerging with new, granular ways for marketers to understand how people are watching television and, in particular, commercials. The appeal of this information has soared as Americans rapidly change their viewing habits, streaming an increasing number of shows weeks or months after they first air, on devices as varied as smartphones, laptops and Roku boxes, not to mention TVs.\u201cThe big thing for TV advertisers and the networks is: Are you actually looking at the screen or not?\u201d said Dan Schiffman, the chief revenue officer of TVision (pronounced Tee-Vision). \u201cWhat you looked at is interesting, but the fact that you looked away is arguably the most interesting.\u201dMr. Schiffman founded TVision, a 30-person start-up, with a classmate from the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T.But some industry executives have criticized Nielsen\u2019s methods as outdated. Nielsen selects homes at random to represent the nation\u2019s viewing audience, and measures who is watching what shows, mostly through meters connected to the sets, as well as diaries in select markets and digital tracking of certain ad-supported programs on tablets and phones.\u201cNielsen will remain the currency for the time being because it is agreed upon as the thing everyone uses,\u201d said Alan Wurtzel, an adviser at NBCUniversal and its former head of research. \u201cBut as the world becomes more complex, as it is, many more additional supplemental or complementary measures will come into play.\u201dInformation gathered by companies like TVision can help advertisers steer marketing toward shows with the most engaged audiences, not just the largest ones. And for networks, it could make a show with a committed and loyal audience as valuable as one that attracts a larger but more casual set of viewers.TVision has recruited 2,000 households, or roughly 7,500 people, in the Boston, Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth areas. The company said the information was transmitted without storing images or video and collected anonymously.Mr. Schiffman said the data would show, for example, \u201cPerson No. 124 in Household 6 was paying attention this second and not paying attention the next to a certain program or advertisement.\u201dSymphony and TVision both use technology that can recognize shows and ads through the audio or digital tags the content contains. Consumers are most likely familiar with this type of technology through the song-recognition app Shazam.Another ratings company, RealityMine, has assembled a panel of 5,000 people in the United States whom it said it paid less than $90 a year, who either have its app, a \u201chome meter\u201d plugged into their internet networks or both. In some instances, its meter may capture activity across 25 devices in a household, such as tablet, phone, Xbox, Wii, Apple TV and Google Chromecast.The aim is \u201cunderstanding what is the media day and the life of the consumer today,\u201d said Charlie Buchwalter, the chief executive of Symphony, which has worked with companies including NBCUniversal.Mr. Schiffman said that while some people were wary of TVision\u2019s technology, they were often placated after learning that it was not storing images or videos.During the Olympics, Ms. Milz wore a Fitbit so that NBC could see how her heart rate changed while she watched certain events.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to understand where people really are and what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re watching, how are they interacting, and ideally after that, how is that changing their behavior or affecting their behavior,\u201d said Jonathan Steuer, the chief research officer of Omnicom Media Group, which oversees media buying for advertisers.By measuring the level of attention a person is paying to a given show, TVision believes it can help bolster niche programs and smaller networks. For example, Mr. Schiffman said the company had found that the series \u201cLucifer,\u201d on Fox, commanded better attention metrics from viewers than \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d on CBS, even though \u201cBig Bang\u201d is one of the TV shows rated highest by Nielsen.\u201cPeople don\u2019t just tune into \u2018Lucifer.\u2019 They DVR it and watch it when they come home,\u201d he said, adding that viewers tend to be focused on the show and stay in the room when it is on.The Weather Channel used TVision\u2019s data in the fall to give it an edge over the news and lifestyle shows it is normally compared against by advertisers. It showed its audience for weather news as \u201clean forward, lean-in viewers,\u201d said Indira Venkat, who oversees research at the channel.\u201cWhat is oftentimes missing is the quality of the audience,\u201d Ms. Venkat said about Nielsen viewing data. \u201cYes, you\u2019re getting audience, but what are they doing in today\u2019s era of multitasking?\u201dFollow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter @Sapna.Advertisement"}

He definitely doesn\u2019t wear one.\u201dThe White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes.Within moments of Mr. Spicer\u2019s comment, reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe.Mr. Spicer added that the story was \u201cso riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology.\u201d He went on, \u201cLiterally, blatant factual errors, and it\u2019s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or so-called reporting.\u201dThe overall piece, which described Mr. Trump\u2019s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic shake-up of a Washington culture he has never inhabited, was \u201cnot an accurate portrayal of what\u2019s really happening,\u201d Mr. Spicer concluded.Mr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning.On Twitter, Mr. Trump called the reports \u201cfake news\u201d that sought to marginalize him.If you missed Mr. Trump talking to Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News during the Super Bowl, you will have another chance tonight.In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to characterize The Times\u2019s coverage, which was based on interviews with several of his White House\u2019s most senior officials and others aware of the administration\u2019s inner workings, as \u201cfiction\u201d based on fabricated sources.It\u2019s official: Silicon Valley really, really despises Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order.The brief, filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is blunt and direct. The ban, it says, \u201chinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations \u2014 and hire new employees \u2014 outside the United States.\u201dIt is a remarkable statement of unity from the country\u2019s technology companies, many of which rely heavily on foreign workers. And it is a shot across the bow for Mr. Trump, foreshadowing a rocky relationship with Silicon Valley leaders over the next four years.The companies were not the only ones joining in opposition. Susan E. Rice, former President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, was among the leaders of a petition signed by a group of former National Security Council officials.The Justice Department on Monday corrected the record on an attention-grabbing claim that one of its lawyers made in a Northern Virginia courtroom about the impact of President Trump\u2019s executive order on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.That number, however, came under question later on Friday, when a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs said that the real number was around 60,000 and that the larger figure had inaccurately included diplomatic visas that were not affected by the ban.\u201cIn response to a question from this court as to how many individuals have been affected by the executive order, government counsel presenting oral argument, based on information he had received, stated that 100,000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of the executive order,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Department of State has since provided undersigned counsel with a revised number, which is roughly 60,000 visas.\u201dAn outside, pro-Trump political group is adding veteran fund-raisers and Republican Party strategists, and is also employing one of the president\u2019s campaign ad makers to try to ensure Senate confirmation of his remaining cabinet nominees.It\u2019s part of a $4 million effort, with three other ads focused specifically on the nominations of Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Tom Price for secretary of health and human services.Some of those ads have been broadcast in states with critical races in the 2018 midterms. The other new advisers are Cara Mason, who worked as the finance director for the Trump Victory committee under Reince Priebus; Rob Collins, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director; Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff; and Rob Simms, a former National Republican Congressional Committee executive director.With Mr. Trump\u2019s administration still evolving, the 45Committee has moved to fill a void, supporting the White House as it finds itself besieged by critics.Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff known for his uncompromising stance on illegal immigration, is back in the news months after losing his bid for re-election.Now he is asking supporters to help him raise $1 million for his legal defense fund. Mr. Arpaio faced numerous lawsuits alleging abuse and faulty medical care in several jails, and taxpayers in Maricopa County, where he was sheriff, spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense.In his email, Mr. Arpaio attributed his re-election defeat to a host of enemies, including \u201cleftist financier George Soros,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department.Mr. Soros spent an estimated $2 million last year opposing Mr. Arpaio, and the Justice Department under Mr. Obama filed criminal contempt-of-court charges against the sheriff for refusing a judge\u2019s order to stop discriminating against Latinos.As the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s largest county, Mr. Arpaio gained a national reputation for immigration raids that targeted heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around the Phoenix area.Thousands of people were caught up in the raids, which were often carried out without any proof of criminal activity, and which critics called racial profiling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Intelligent Weaponry Gets Smarter", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert O. Work, the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump, calls them his \u201cA.I. dudes.\u201d The breezy moniker belies their serious task: The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts, and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield.Last spring, he asked, \u201cO.K., you guys are the smartest guys in A.I., right?\u201dNo, the dudes told him, \u201cthe smartest guys are at Facebook and Google,\u201d Mr. Work recalled in an interview.Now, increasingly, they\u2019re also in China. The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology, which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare.The Pentagon\u2019s plan to bring A.I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies.Last year, for example, Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech.That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence.Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons. In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on brand-new Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nation\u2019s leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons.But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls.In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagon\u2019s ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, today\u2019s new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees.As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nation\u2019s government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence.Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field.\u201cThe Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies,\u201d said Adam Segal, a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at the Council on Foreign Relations.The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as \u201cremote warfare,\u201d said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers.\u201cThey are making their machines more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cA little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost.\u201dWhether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States.Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and self-confident to understand the speed of the Chinese competition.\u201cThere are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then U.S. media reports only on the U.S. version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the U.S.\u201dThe company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a \u201cHumanoid Answering Robot.\u201d\u201cOur goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future,\u201d said Qingfeng Liu, Iflytek\u2019s chief executive.The speed of the Chinese technologists, compared to United States and European artificial intelligence developers, is noteworthy. Last April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intel\u2019s laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from Intel and Google to build a self-driving car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal \u2014 taking a demonstration to the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas \u2014 after just nine months of work.\u201cThe A.I. technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely home-brewed,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cWe wrote every line by ourselves.\u201dTheir first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis.The United States\u2019 view of China\u2019s advance may be starting to change. Last October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is now publishing more research than scholars here.Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make A.I. a priority in its military systems.Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view.\u201cIt is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in A.I., and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a Taiwanese-born artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both Microsoft\u2019s and Google\u2019s China-based research laboratories.Mr. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $675 million to invest in A.I. both in the United States and in China.\u201cUsing a chess analogy,\u201d he said, \u201cwe might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the master-level A.I. scientists.\u201dWhat is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American A.I. research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China.In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baidu\u2019s Silicon Valley A.I. Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit Stanford University artificial intelligence courses.One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom.Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly.In a reflection of the desire to become a center of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by Intel\u2019s Xeon processors; after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing.The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge. It can be used to model climate change situations, for instance, or to perform analysis of large data sets.But similar advances in high-performance computing being made by the Chinese could be used to push ahead with machine-learning research, which would have military applications, along with more typical defense functions, such as simulating nuclear weapons tests or breaking the encryption used by adversaries.The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward J. Snowden\u2019s revelations about the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to China\u2019s market.Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley.\u201cNo one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon can\u2019t say it\u2019s about China, and the tech companies can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cBut it\u2019s there in the background.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Danish Companies Seek to Hire, but Everyone\u2019s Already Working", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was just one hitch: He did not have enough employees for the job.Delivery was delayed, by one month, then two, then three, as he searched for skilled welders to speed the work at the sprawling factory. But in Denmark\u2019s fast-recovering economy, they were hard to come by.More than a third of companies in this industrial and technically advanced nation can no longer recruit enough skilled workers to fill posts. Vacancies abound for I.T. specialists, computer scientists, engineers and mechanics, as well as for electricians and carpenters. The wages needed to lure them are creeping up. Affected firms are scaling back production, turning down contracts and postponing expansion plans.\u201cWe need more skilled workers, but we can\u2019t get them,\u201d said Mr. Enevoldsen, who recently joined other companies in a nationwide advertising campaign to lure talent. \u201cIf the labor shortage continues, it could sharply impact our growth, and growth in general.\u201dEurope\u2019s recovery is gaining traction fastest in the north, where Britain, Germany and Denmark\u2019s Nordic neighbors also pushing toward full employment. The unemployment rate has fallen in the United States as well, and some economists have expressed optimism the country may be headed in that direction.But the experience in Denmark shows what can happen with too much of a good thing.After a painful recession, unemployment is now at 4.3 percent, which is about as low as it can go without provoking inflation. During an economic boom a decade ago, joblessness fell as low as 2.4 percent, igniting an unsustainable spiral of higher wages and prices that the government desperately wants to avoid today.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see higher growth because we don\u2019t have the labor needed for that,\u201d said Steen Nielsen, the director of labor market policy at the Confederation of Danish Industry, the country\u2019s main business lobby group. \u201cWe may have to be happy with low growth rates in the future unless we can stimulate labor supply.\u201dSome employers have also looked to refugees to fill jobs, but few of the newcomers are readily employable in high-skilled work, and the government tightened policies recently to discourage more asylum seekers from coming in.Germany, which faces a shortage of engineers, nurses and other skilled workers, has taken the opposite tack, setting up training programs for refugees in an attempt to bridge the gap.In Denmark, some companies have resorted to creating jobs abroad.\u201cWe wanted to hire in our own country but it was impossible,\u201d said Janus Benn Sorensen, one of the company\u2019s three founders. \u201cWe still have vacant positions here, and we can\u2019t find anyone to take them.\u201dAt Sjorring, Mr. Enevoldsen tried for more than a year to add skilled welders and industrial designers to the 275-person work force. The company, which has won business from Volvo and Caterpillar, has a 20-acre factory in Denmark\u2019s forested north that runs a partly automated assembly line.He offered a salary bump of more than 2 percent, but raising wages further would crimp his margins. Though he managed to recruit some Eastern European workers, he still lacks manpower.Last year\u2019s delayed order for the European client, worth 600,000 euros, or $637,000, was eventually completed. But he worried that the labor shortage could keep Sjorring from reaching the next level.\u201cWe could have grown even more if we had the right people, that\u2019s indisputable,\u201d said Mr. Enevoldsen, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, who has turned to a headhunter to find eight welders and machine programmers.Others are having similar problems. Teccon Form, which makes tools for injection molding and employs around 20 designers and mechanical engineers, had to turn away potential customers last year because it couldn\u2019t expand staffing.\u201cThere\u2019s just not that many people out there who aren\u2019t in a job,\u201d said Michael Nederby, the company\u2019s managing director. He is now searching in Germany, Poland and Portugal for workers. \u201cThe problem will get worse in coming years.\u201dAnd not everyone who could be working is doing so: Around 92,000 Danes are collecting jobless benefits, and companies say many of them could be employed.The government is testing measures to encourage early retirees, students and recipients of disability pensions to work. Businesses are also lobbying lawmakers to intensify the teaching of technology and vocational skills in schools to churn out more young Danes prepared for a high-tech world.Even big companies feel the pinch. Microsoft\u2019s Denmark operation had trouble recruiting I.T. workers, then struggled to get marketing and sales representatives, said Marianne Dahl Steensen, the company\u2019s general manager in the country. Because of its scale, Microsoft is able to lure skilled foreign workers to Copenhagen, but keeping them is a top priority.\u201cWe make sure to have a very modern, flexible workplace,\u201d Ms. Steensen said. The company emphasizes gender and ethnic diversity, and works with refugees and the long-term unemployed to cultivate talent.For smaller Danish companies, solutions cannot come fast enough.Clio Online started with three employees and now has 90 in its crowded Copenhagen office, creating content for teachers and students, including real-time course materials about President Trump or the Women\u2019s March on Washington.The company quickly became Denmark\u2019s market leader. But ambitions to expand, thanks to orders from nearby Sweden or further afield in Saudi Arabia, whose government is digitizing libraries and educational texts, hit a ceiling.It opened its Ukraine office three years ago, but cultural differences slowed efficiency. For instance, employees would not proceed with a work request from the Danish team until they vetted it with higher-ups in Ukraine.The company\u2019s chief marketing officer, Thomas Overholt Hansen, estimates it lost up to \u20ac1.5 million in potential revenue last year as the labor shortage limited its ability to serve new clients.\u201cWe\u2019re losing money every day,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Do Billionaires Have in Common? Big Bucks, and Not Much Else", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat do Larry Ellison and Ingvar Kamprad have in common? They are both billionaires. But that may be one of the few characteristics they share.Billionaires may have enormous spending potential, but they certainly exercise that power differently. Some live lavishly and enjoy being in the headlines, while others live frugally, if not anonymously. There are big spenders and those who give it away.His fellow billionaire Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, bought 74-acre Necker Island in the Caribbean in 1979. It operates as a private luxury resort, with room for 34 adults and six children at about $2,300 each per night. He also bought nearby Mosquito Island in 2007, the site of former President Barack Obama\u2019s recent vacation. Mr. Branson is a serial blogger and Twitter user, sending out inspirational messages about entrepreneurship, conservation, music and travel.Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, is unmistakable on the high seas in his $250 million superyacht, Octopus, which has two helicopter pads, a submarine, a glass-bottom swimming pool and a recording studio, not to mention room for 26 guests. Recently, he has been known to host a celebrity-studded party on Octopus during the Cannes Film Festival. But he has a serious side, too. Mr. Allen last year gave $295 million to brain and cell science, wildlife conservation, global health and climate change.But not all billionaires like to be so obvious. Chuck Feeney, who built an empire of duty-free shops and a multibillion-dollar fortune along the way, has worked since the 1980s to give all that money away, as quietly as possible.Forbes magazine once called him the \u201cJames Bond of philanthropy\u201d for his work through his charity, the Atlantic Philanthropies. The foundation has given away $8 billion to education, science, health care and human rights projects around the world and made its final grant last year. It plans to close for good in 2020.The fact is, most \u201cordinary\u201d billionaires live quietly. \u201cUnlike what the public thinks, the majority of these people come out of the middle class or even poverty,\u201d said Jim Grubman, a clinical psychologist who wrote \u201cStrangers in Paradise,\u201d a book about how people adjust to becoming wealthy.\u201cThe billionaire lifestyle makes for good TV, but below the surface is a much bigger portion of people who are salt-of-the-earth families just concentrating on raising their kids and running their businesses,\u201d said Mr. Grubman, who is a consultant at Cambridge Family Enterprise Group, an adviser to wealthy families.Asia is an active area of billionaire creation, with one person reaching that threshold every three days, according to a study released in October by UBS and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.Asia\u2019s two richest men are Jack Ma, founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, with a $26 billion net worth, and Wang Jianlin, a real estate mogul with $29 billion to his name who also holds stakes in a Spanish soccer club and the Hollywood film production company Legendary Entertainment.In 2015, The Economist reported on the party Mr. Wang held to celebrate his deal to buy Infront Sports & Media, which has marketing rights to World Cup soccer. The magazine said that Mr. Wang favored \u201cprivate jets and flashy yachts (he owns Sunseeker, the British maker of the sleek craft seen in James Bond films),\u201d and that the party featured strobe lights, disco music and leggy beauties.In the winter, many flock to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland; the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah; and New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations on St. Barts, where people can rent their own eight-bedroom beachfront villa for $420,000 a week.In the summer, some of the richest flock to Britain for the Henley Royal Regatta, the Royal Ascot horse races, and Wimbledon, where a center-court season ticket at the men\u2019s championship final this year has a market value of $3,300.So far, 156 billionaires and their families have committed to the cause, according to the profiles listed on the pledge\u2019s website.

{"Headline": "Tech Opposition to Trump Propelled by Employees, Not Executives", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late September, a group of tech leaders started a well-publicized effort to raise $100,000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324.For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent.No longer.Nearly 100 technology companies said that President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries would violate both immigration law and the United States Constitution.\u201cSilicon Valley is stepping up,\u201d said Sam Altman, who runs the valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, Y Combinator. \u201cThe companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don\u2019t support.\u201dIt is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable \u2014 not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.\u201cPeople voted with their feet, and Travis listened,\u201d said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. \u201cWe need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.\u201dResistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a voice with the president if you didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.\u201dWhen President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, he upended the fates of people who had waited for years to get into the U.S. Here are portraits of those affected by the ban.Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,\u201d said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey all have the same leanings.\u201dMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google\u2019s former slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is the most forceful expression of this.\u201cIf you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,\u201d Mr. Shotts said.Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards,\u201d and saying it would create \u201cmuch collateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dThe immigration battle is in Microsoft\u2019s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\u201cIn 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,\u201d said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. \u201cThe most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.\u201dMr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous \u201cfor the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren\u2019t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can\u2019t fix the monetization of fake news.\u201dPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.\u201cI\u2019ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,\u201d said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.He talked about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which asks women, \u201cWhat would you do if you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201d Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women\u2019s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.\u201cWe have to protest in public,\u201d he said. The event raised $30,000 for the legal aid groups.\u201cIt looked like two-thirds of the room were newcomers,\u201d Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement.\u201cI want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re pushing at least as hard as Trump is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Chief Taps Into the \u2018Right Now\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were undergraduates at Stanford University, they made an unconventional observation about what makes a social network valuable.Thanks to the rise of Facebook, most everyone believed that networks became exponentially more valuable by amassing more users. But Mr. Spiegel noticed that in real life, even people with thousands of acquaintances spent most of their time with just a few friends whose value outweighed a large number of looser ties.While online identity previously emphasized everything anyone has ever done, with Snapchat \u201cmy identity is who I am right now,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said in a 2015 video to describe the app.Along with financial information, Mr. Spiegel is expected to include remarks about Snap\u2019s mission that will showcase his zag-while-zigging philosophy.\u201cIf you want to understand Snap, look at Evan Spiegel,\u201d said Todd Chaffee, a partner at IVP, one of Snap\u2019s three largest venture capital investors. \u201cHe is the visionary who drives that company.\u201dMary Ritti, a spokeswoman for Snap, declined to comment for this story.Mr. Spiegel grew up in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy Los Angeles suburb, and attended Crossroads, a prep school in Santa Monica that counts Jonah Hill, Kate Hudson and Jack Black as alumni.He lived a privileged life, with expensive cars, exclusive club memberships and fancy vacations, according to records from his parents\u2019 divorce proceedings. His father, John Spiegel, a securities lawyer who helped overhaul the Los Angeles Police Department after the Rodney King beating in 1991, also had his children volunteer and build homes in poor areas of Mexico.While many techies talk about how the industry is a meritocracy, Mr. Spiegel has not shied from his wealthy roots. In public comments, he has said he is \u201ca young, white, educated male who got really, really lucky. And life isn\u2019t fair.\u201dAt Stanford, also his father\u2019s alma mater, Mr. Spiegel majored in product design and started a handful of companies with Mr. Murphy, a fellow Kappa Sigma fraternity brother. (Their early start-ups flopped.) There, Mr. Spiegel also met some of the men who would become his mentors, including Scott Cook, then the chief executive of Intuit, and Eric Schmidt, the Google chairman, who taught an M.B.A. class that he attended.Mr. Spiegel \u201creally is the next Gates or Zuckerberg,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said in an interview, comparing the Snap chief to Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, Bill Gates, and Facebook\u2019s chief, Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cHe has superb manners, which he says he got from his mother. He credits his father\u2019s long legal calls, which he overheard, to giving him perspective on business and structure as a very young man.\u201dWhen Snapchat started taking off, Mr. Spiegel did not wait to graduate from Stanford. He moved the company to the Venice Beach boardwalk, away from what he perceived as Silicon Valley\u2019s too-narrow focus on technology.When Mr. Spiegel met Institutional Venture Partners to discuss possible fund-raising, for example, he told IVP\u2019s partner, Dennis Phelps, that he was unwilling to accept the firm\u2019s standard investment terms.\u201cHe\u2019s different from most tech people because he knows what\u2019s cool and what\u2019s next,\u201d said Ryan Wilson, an artist in Los Angeles who goes by the name ThankYouX. He worked with Mr. Spiegel on a piece of art for one of Snapchat\u2019s offices. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like things because a dealer says he should. He just likes what he likes, whether it\u2019s made by a high school friend or a famous artist.\u201dMr. Spiegel has also involved himself in some political conversations. In 2015, he met with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, as a member of the 21st Century Council at the Berggruen Institute. Its founder, Nicolas Berggruen, said he impressed a group that includes Mohamed El-Erian, the economist, and former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with his \u201cthoughtful and mature approach to people.\u201d Last fall, Mr. Spiegel also attended a private dinner with John O. Brennan, then the director of the C.I.A. According to multiple attendees, Mr. Spiegel listened more than he spoke and had the ear of Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles.Mr. Spiegel\u2019s unconventional streak may be most evident in how he has steered Snap. He has long said that a public offering was what was best for the company and its investors, even as other tech start-ups chose to stay private as long as possible.Since Snapchat\u2019s debut, the app and the company have also undergone dozens of changes that were criticized for being too different from other consumer internet companies.Mr. Spiegel rejected the idea of a newsfeed in Snapchat\u2019s app, for example, because he said people prefer stories chronologically. In Facebook\u2019s News Feed, posts are reverse chronological, meaning the newest posts are at the top.Unlike other social networks, Snapchat also does not use algorithms to push people to see certain content. Snapchat users swipe their screens to navigate and view video vertically, rather than tap on menus or turn their phones to watch videos horizontally.\u201cFrom what I can figure out, he thinks differently about the way to monetize and develop a social network,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said of Mr. Spiegel.Investors who buy into Snap\u2019s initial public offering will soon be getting a piece of that approach.Allowing \u201courselves to be pulled in another direction\u201d is what makes us human, Mr. Spiegel said in a commencement speech at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business in 2015. Quoting John F. Kennedy, he added, \u201cConformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

Beyonc\u00e9 appeared as a goddess of femininity, while Adele endeared herself to the crowd with her humanity, flaws included. Both stole the show.Then there was Beyonc\u00e9, who offered a jaw-dropping, multimedia homage to motherhood in a segment that stunned the celebrities in attendance and immediately set social media on fire. After an affectionate introduction by her own mother, Tina Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9 appeared as a crowned fertility goddess with her pregnant belly highlighted for the camera; at one point, her 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, ran around her.Explaining her ambitions for \u201cLemonade,\u201d an album and film, she said, \u201cIt is important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty,\u201d so they will \u201chave no doubt that they are beautiful, intelligent and capable.\u201dShe added, \u201cThis is something I want for every child of every race.\u201dBeyonc\u00e9, who had been nominated for nine awards this year, more than any other artist, in the end won only two: best urban contemporary album for \u201cLemonade\u201d and a music video prize for the song \u201cFormation.\u201dHere were some of the night\u2019s other big storylines.For the music industry, Adele represents a supreme form of success in what has become the old model: selling millions of CDs to her fans. But in an acknowledgment of the music industry\u2019s rapidly shifting business model, three Grammys, including best new artist, went to Chance the Rapper, a gospel-influenced performer from Chicago whose music was released independently and is available only on streaming services.But by far the fiercest was by the veteran hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, whose members accused \u201cPresident Agent Orange\u201d of \u201cperpetuating evil\u201d throughout the country, before dancers broke through a prop wall behind them and women in Islamic garb took the stage. At the end of the segment, the group and its company raised their right fists in the air in the black power salute, while the rapper Q-Tip repeatedly shouted, \u201cResist!\u201dJennifer Lopez, before awarding the best new artist prize, quoted Toni Morrison: \u201cThis is precisely the time when artists go to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear.\u201dThe Prince tribute came on the same day that much of his music was released widely on streaming music services, a result of a series of deals reached with Prince\u2019s estate; during his life, Prince closely policed his music online, and pulled his songs down from all services but Tidal.Not all tributes were to the dead, but a medley of Bee Gees songs was almost as reverent. Demi Lovato, Tori Kelly, Little Big Town and Andra Day played \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d \u201cHow Deep Is Your Love\u201d and others from the Bee Gees\u2019 classic soundtrack to \u201cSaturday Night Fever,\u201d 40 years after its release.Before the show began, the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys, handed out prizes in a nontelevised ceremony hosted by the comedian Margaret Cho and held at the smaller Microsoft Theater nearby. Among the winners were the young country singer-songwriter Sturgill Simpson, for best country album for \u201cA Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth,\u201d and Carol Burnett, who beat out the likes of Amy Schumer, Patti Smith, Elvis Costello and the punk survivor John Doe in the best spoken word album category.\u201cThere\u2019s never a bad day with Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d Ms. Matsoukas said.These were Mr. Bowie\u2019s first musical Grammys; he won a video award in 1985 and a lifetime achievement citation in 2006. (\u201cBlackstar\u201d also won for best art direction.)The early awards recognize many of the musicians who operate below the level of stardom, as well as the engineers and producers whose names are seldom known by fans but who are a vital part of the process.\u201cThis award ceremony is the real Grammys,\u201d Ms. Cho said.Boldface names seldom show up to this part of the Grammys, but those performers who do come often accept their honors with heavy emotions, and underscore how much the award can mean to the industry\u2019s rank and file.Lori McKenna was tearful as she accepted the best country song award as the writer of \u201cHumble and Kind,\u201d which was recorded by Tim McGraw.\u201cI just sat at my dining room table and wrote a song for my kids one day,\u201d Ms. McKenna said. \u201cAnd Tim McGraw, he made this beautiful moment of it.\u201dThe blues singer Bobby Rush, winning his first Grammy at age 83 for best traditional blues album, for \u201cPorcupine Meat,\u201d said: \u201cThis is my 374th record. And finally.\u201dThe show had other moments of levity. When Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots won best pop duo/group performance, they immediately stripped out of their pants and walked to the stage in their underwear.Mr. Joseph explained that before they were famous, the two had watched the Grammy awards in their skivvies and pledged that if they ever won, \u201cwe should receive it just like this.\u201dHe added: \u201cI want everyone who\u2019s watching at home to know, you could be next. So watch out, because anyone from anywhere can do anything.\u201dAfter the commercial break, Mr. Corden appeared pantless too.Later, in a tongue-in-cheek exploitation of his popular \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d skits, Mr. Corden stood in the aisle of the Staples Center with a makeshift car frame around him, and, in a moment reminiscent of the selfie at the 2014 Oscars, gathered celebrities around him. Jennifer Lopez, John Legend, Keith Urban, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill and Neil Diamond sang Mr. Diamond\u2019s \u201cSweet Caroline,\u201d with the entire arena shouting along.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You Might Not Want to Take Away a Billionaire\u2019s Money", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThere is a problem with billionaires: They\u2019ve got way more money than any human deserves.But if you were simply to take it all away from them, you would, in many cases, be doing more harm than good.In my teens, when I saw hungry people on the streets of New York I started to dream of expropriating money from the wealthy to feed the poor. My father, who rose from Depression-era poverty in Scranton, Pa., to modest affluence as a New York City businessman, tried to set me straight on the subject.\u201cThink it through,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might bring some justice to the world and you\u2019d help some needy people. But you\u2019d lose what people like the Rockefellers have done for the common man, the museums, the parks, the libraries, the schools, and the contributions to medical research, and on and on. It\u2019s no small thing.\u201dThen, my dad said, consider the horrendous cost of expropriation in countries that have tried it \u2014 the bloodshed, the lost lives, the ruined families, the economies stunted by revolutionary violence. In the 1980s and 1990s, I spent time as a reporter in countries that had endured such ordeals \u2014 particularly post-Cultural Revolution China and Russia before and after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.That Mr. Mnuchin overlooked perhaps $100 million is unfathomable for many people. It is, in fact, roughly equivalent to the total net worth of more than 1,200 typical American families. And $1 billion is more than 12,000 of those households, according to the Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances of 2013.My father died in September 2015, a month before his 93rd birthday, while the presidential primary campaign was still underway. Income inequality was a big issue. In his insurgent campaign on the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders focused on it directly. Despite his wealth, Mr. Trump addressed it too, indirectly, promising to restore lost jobs and prosperity to downtrodden Americans. And perhaps he will accomplish that.It is not impossible, after all, to imagine a small elite of extremely wealthy people\u2019s presiding over an economy that provides a rising standard of living for everyone else, especially for people at the bottom. America has had wealthy politicians before, Rockefellers among them, and some have attempted such a feat. Two wealthy presidents came from New York \u2014 aristocratic cousins named Roosevelt \u2014 and both pushed for what was sometimes considered \u201crevolutionary\u201d redistribution of wealth in the United States, as my father periodically reminded me.He advocated \u201ca progressive tax on all fortunes beyond a certain amount,\u201d adding that such a tax should make it impossible for \u201cthe owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual.\u201dThat didn\u2019t happen on his watch.But his younger cousin President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a pragmatic Democrat, said in 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression, that it was high time to take risks and help suffering people. \u201cAbove all, try something,\u201d he said. \u201cThe millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach.\u201dChanges in the tax system \u2014 which, for the most part, will favor the wealthy \u2014 are widely expected under the Trump administration and the Republican Congress.My dad isn\u2019t around to discuss any of this now but I know what he would say, and I say it to my own son. I tell him that our flawed civil society is nonetheless precious and that all of us, billionaires included, need to do whatever we can to make it more just.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Giants to Announce Creation of a Computing System Based on Ethereum", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase and other corporate giants are joining forces to create a new kind of computing system based on the virtual currency network Ethereum.Some 30 companies are set to announce on Tuesday the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which will create a standard version of the Ethereum software that businesses around the world can use to track data and financial contracts.The new organization, a nonprofit, is part of a broader movement to harness the technological concept known as the blockchain, which was introduced to the world by Bitcoin.Blockchains offer a way for unrelated computers and companies to simultaneously collect and store information without relying on a central authority, similar to the way that Wikipedia is written and maintained by a group of writers and editors rather than a single author.The technology is viewed as being harder to corrupt or hack because of its reliance on many people rather than a single authority.Many big corporations have been looking for ways to use blockchain technology to keep track of information created by unrelated companies, like stock and bond trading transactions.IBM has made a particularly big push into the blockchain business, and it has been leading a separate collaborative project, known as the Hyperledger Foundation.The new Ethereum alliance has been described by some of its backers as a way to ensure that the IBM-led blockchain effort is not the only option for businesses looking to use the technology. Other companies like R3 and Chain have also been developing alternative blockchains.\u201cWe are pretty equally spending our time across the different chains,\u201d said Alex Batlin, the global head of blockchain at Bank of New York Mellon, which is joining the Ethereum alliance.Ethereum was introduced in 2013 by a developer named Vitalik Buterin, then 19, who had previously worked on Bitcoin. Since its official release in 2015, the Ethereum network has been the target of hackers and theft.Yet it has also won a large following among programmers who view it as a new and sophisticated way for groups of people and companies to initiate and track transactions and contracts of all sorts.That has led some companies to bet that Ethereum will win the race to become the standard blockchain for future business operations.\u201cIn every industry that we come across, Ethereum is usually the first platform that people go to,\u201d said Marley Gray, the principal blockchain architect at Microsoft.The creation of the Ethereum alliance shows a continuing commitment among big companies to making the technology work, in large part because it promises to create much more streamlined databases that require less back-office maintenance.The current Ethereum network has an internal virtual currency known as Ether, the value of which has risen and fallen over the last two years. On Monday, a single Ether was worth around $15, and all the outstanding Ether were worth around $1.3 billion.Ethereum, however, is much more than just a system for tracking currency. It also allows people to write what are known as smart contracts into the Ethereum blockchain. Two companies could, for instance, create a contract that would automatically send money to one of them if a particular news authority reported that the Chicago Cubs won the World Series or that \u201cLa La Land\u201d won the Oscar for best picture. (As the latter example shows, what would happen if the authority was wrong is a more difficult question.)Because of its capacity for smart contracts \u2014 and other complicated computing capacities \u2014 Ethereum is viewed as more agile and adaptable than Bitcoin.The companies working on the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance want to create a private version of Ethereum that can be rolled out for specific purposes and be open only to certified participants. Banks could create one blockchain for themselves, and shipping companies could create another for their own purposes.The purpose of the alliance is to create a standard, open-source version of Ethereum that can provide a foundation for any specific use case.The private systems are not likely to require an Ether virtual currency, although the companies are hoping to create modules that will allow users to put in and take out individual elements of Ethereum as they choose.Many companies have already been working to create their own versions of Ethereum for specific purposes.JPMorgan, for instance, has created a version of Ethereum known as Quorum that the bank has been using in tests to move money between JPMorgan branches in different countries. Quorum will become a part of the new version of Ethereum being developed by the alliance.Some of the companies working in the new alliance hope that the private Ethereum blockchains will, at some point, be able to connect to the public Ethereum blockchain, creating a standard for information storage and movement around the world.\u201cEven if you create private networks, if you can anchor them to public networks, you get an extremely strong set of links together,\u201d Mr. Batlin, of BNY Mellon, said.Mr. Batlin and others involved in the Ethereum Alliance said the way the Ethereum developers had handled that attack convinced them of the maturity of the technology.Today, Ethereum has a larger community of volunteer developers, and more computers on its network than Bitcoin. And the members of the new alliance \u2014 which include Banco Santander, BBVA, Credit Suisse, ING, Intel, Thomson Reuters and UBS \u2014 say the real-world testing of Ethereum makes it stronger than the alternatives.\u201cEthereum has this massive advantage of having the public network that has been tested for two years,\u201d Mr. Gray, of Microsoft, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Plan Is Most Unfriendly to Outsiders", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorSnap Inc. is aiming to adopt the most shareholder-unfriendly governance in an initial public offering, ever.It is different from its predecessors, Facebook and Google, which went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. In recent years, Facebook and Google have revised this structure to add a nonvoting third class of shares to preserve founder control, yet shareholders have had at least some vote even if they couldn\u2019t sway the results.Snap has followed the natural evolution of this disenfranchisement, simply eliminating shareholder rights from the get-go. And this is not just about replicating the venture capital model, where founders get control but investors get board seats and veto rights over significant transactions. Here, Snap is not even giving crumbs.For gurus of good corporate governance, this is bad enough, but once you dig into the details of how this nonvoting stock works, it gets much worse for shareholders.Snap has set up three share classes. Class A will be offered to the public. These shares have no voting rights and no hope of ever having voting rights.Class B shares have one vote each and are convertible into Class A stock. These are shares held by prior investors and employees.Then there are the Class C shares, with 10 votes each, which are convertible into Class B stock. These shares are held in equal number by the two Snap co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy. Specifically, each of them holds 107,943,924 Class C shares. These shares will give the two men complete voting control over Snap.The two founders have a proxy arrangement that transfers voting control to the other if one dies, but it doesn\u2019t cover whether they vote their shares together while alive, so presumably they could deadlock. Snap has solved this problem by granting a performance stock award to Mr. Spiegel that will be 3 percent of the company\u2019s post-I.P.O. value.This award will be paid out in equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in the third full quarter after the offering. After this, Mr. Spiegel will have total control over Snap and Mr. Murphy will simply be a close second.Snap, which looks a lot like Twitter did at its I.P.O. stage, could also experience bumps in the road as Twitter did. In its prospectus, Snap calls itself a camera company, but it really has just one product, Snapchat, which is beloved by the younger crowd for its disappearing photos and texts.Facebook, Google and Microsoft as well as Amazon have survived because of the ability to provide multiple successful offerings. Twitter has struggled with just one product \u2014 the platform on which people the world over, including the American president, send 140-character messages called tweets.If things are going well, no one is going to question Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy\u2019s control. But if things are bad, then shareholder complaints may be valid, a spur to action. Indeed, control makes sense only if shareholders and the two executives disagree about whether things are going well. But that assumes that shareholders will be irrational or wrong or not know as much as the two men at the helm. The last point may have some validity \u2014 but is it worth complete disenfranchisement, again given that Snap is a very early-stage company and Mr. Spiegel is so young?I suppose it all might be palatable for most diversified investors in exchange for the huge potential upside, except for the last two parts of this scheme. First, in October Snap issued a dividend of one Class A share for each Class C share the two men owned. The result was to allow Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy to sell half their shares without worry of losing control. The company could reload this at any point, issuing out another dividend of Class A shares if the two need more money.So, barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die. This raises some interesting possibilities.Hypothetical Scenario 1: Mr. Spiegel is hit by a bus and dies. Mr. Murphy would now have complete control of the company. Yet Mr. Spiegel is supposed to be the visionary executive who justified this voting structure. Or is Mr. Murphy, 28, equally visionary? (Or perhaps it is more likely they are just executing well on the \u201cdisappearing pictures\u201d concept just as Mark Cuban executed well on \u201cinternet radio\u201d before selling broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for billions of dollars.)Hypothetical Scenario 2: At age 30, Mr. Spiegel decides that life as a billionaire married to a supermodel (he\u2019s engaged to Miranda Kerr) is more fun spent on an island in the Pacific. He quits his job but still holds Class C shares and wields his power to elect directors and run the company part time.Hypothetical Scenario 3: Mr. Spiegel continues to hold the shares and keep his day job and at age 50 is head of a middling internet company with great potential, but he refuses to give up control, or starts behaving erratically.Potential investors, particularly the big money managers like the BlackRocks of the world, should likely be asking themselves: Is it all worth it, given the risks? I\u2019d note here that Google has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Mr. Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook nonvoting stock. Does Mr. Spiegel deserve better than that?

{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Wouldn\u2019t Work Without Immigrants", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The workers of Silicon Valley make unlikely revolutionaries. As a group, they are relatively wealthy, well educated and well connected.While most here supported Hillary Clinton, tech workers are not the most obvious targets of President Trump\u2019s policy ideas. Many who populate the world\u2019s richest tech companies will be just fine if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. Most will not be personally inconvenienced by the proposed Mexican border wall.Under Mr. Trump, tech workers could enjoy a windfall. They may get tax credits for child care costs, their companies may be allowed to repatriate foreign profits, and their coming income tax cuts might fund a luxury vacation or two.\u201cSilicon Valley is unlikely, as a phenomenon \u2014 it is not the default state of the world,\u201d said John Collison, an immigrant from Ireland who is a co-founder of Stripe, a six-year-old payments start-up based in San Francisco.One important reason Silicon Valley can exist at all, he said, is that it is welcoming to people from far outside its borders. \u201cI go all across the world, and every other place is asking, \u2018How do we replicate Silicon Valley where we are \u2014 in London, in Paris, in Singapore, in Australia?\u2019\u201dThe reason those places have so far failed to create their own indomitable tech hubs is that everyone there wants to come here.\u201cThe U.S. is sucking up all the talent from all across the world,\u201d Mr. Collison said. \u201cLook at all the leading technology companies globally, and look at how overrepresented the United States is. That\u2019s not a normal state of affairs. That\u2019s because we have managed to create this engine where the best and the brightest from around the world are coming to Silicon Valley.\u201dBut, Mr. Collison added, \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of fragile.\u201d Under Mr. Trump, the immigrant-friendly dynamic could change \u2014 and it could bring about the ruin of American tech.And yet even a casual trip through most histories of the technology industry reveals an outsize role played by immigrants.Collectively, these companies, which include householdish names like Uber, Tesla and Palantir, had created thousands of jobs and added billions of dollars to the American economy. Their founders came from all over the world \u2014 India, Britain, Canada, Israel and China, among lots and lots of other points around the globe.That should come as no surprise if you are familiar with the origins of the most iconic companies of the last few decades. One of Google\u2019s founders is an immigrant from Russia, and its current chief executive is an immigrant from India. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive is also from India. EBay and Yahoo were started by immigrants. Facebook\u2019s largest subsidiaries, Instagram and WhatsApp, were both co-founded by immigrants. Apple was started by a child of immigrants.But if that criticism rings true in some parts of the tech industry, it misses the picture among Silicon Valley\u2019s top companies. One common misperception of Silicon Valley is that it operates like a factory; in that view, tech companies can hire just about anyone from anywhere in the world to fill a particular role.But today\u2019s most ambitious tech companies are not like factories. They\u2019re more like athletic teams. They\u2019re looking for the LeBrons and Bradys \u2014 the best people in the world to come up with some brand-new, never-before-seen widget, to completely reimagine what widgets should do in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s not about adding tens or hundreds of thousands of people into manufacturing plants,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the co-founder and chief executive of the cloud-storage company Box. \u201cIt\u2019s about the couple ideas that are going to be invented that are going to change everything.\u201dIf you look at some of the most consequential ideas in tech, you find an unusual number that were developed by immigrants. For instance, Google\u2019s entire advertising business \u2014 that is, the basis for the vast majority of its revenues and profits, the engine that allows it to hire thousands of people in the United States \u2014 was created by three immigrants: Salar Kamangar and Omid Kordestani, who came to the United States from Iran, and Eric Veach, from Canada.But it\u2019s not just a numbers thing. Another reason immigrants do so well in tech is that people from outside bring new perspectives that lead to new ideas.Mike Krieger, an immigrant from Brazil who is a co-founder of Instagram, the photo-based social network app, said one reason it found instant, international success was that he purposely eliminated most text from the app. He knew from growing up in Brazil that English would hinder adoption in most parts of the world.\u201cEvery step of the way while we were creating it,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were thinking, can you create something with international appeal?\u201dMr. Collison, of Stripe, said he could not imagine creating a company without immigrants. \u201cIn the early stages of a start-up you usually have a very specific set of things you need to do, and there\u2019s a very short list of people who are able to do them,\u201d he said.In its early years, Stripe needed engineers and executives to build its system for moving money around the world; it needed to create a novel machine-learning system to detect fraud; and it had to convince regulators and other businesses that it was safe and legal to process payments through Stripe. The people it found for all these roles happened to be immigrants.\u201cThe fact that we can do that in Silicon Valley \u2014 the fact that the talent is here or that we can bring the talent here, that\u2019s what makes the whole thing work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Are the Richest of the Rich?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isn\u2019t a lot of money in 1997.Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, \u201cO.K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion.\u201dTwenty years after the movie \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d was released, billions of dollars aren\u2019t what they used to be, either.Bill Gates alone is just $10 billion shy of Dr. Evil\u2019s ransom demand, according to a list of the world\u2019s top 10 billionaires compiled by Wealth-X, a financial research firm. Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, tops the list at $89.3 billion, followed by his friend Warren Buffett at $73.5 billion.The top 10 \u2014 nine from the United States, one from Spain \u2014 have a combined net worth of $582 billion. While their wealth would certainly be enough to save the world from Dr. Evil, what they do with it in real life is the subject of great interest and debate.That is true now more than ever. Issues around money \u2014 like wealth inequality and talk of tax cuts for the rich \u2014 are among the hottest topics of the day. And the richest president in history is sitting in the Oval Office, with billionaires sprinkled throughout his cabinet.To some, today\u2019s billionaires are like Dr. Evil: selfish, rapacious and bent on world domination. To others, billionaires are worthy of respect for having put their names and fortunes behind an array of philanthropic endeavors, many aimed at improving the lives of people at the very base of the wealth pyramid.There were 2,473 billionaires in the world, as of Wealth-X\u2019s last count through 2015. That was a 6.4 percent increase in billionaires from the year before.But who these billionaires are and what they\u2019re like is more difficult to discern. Many may seem as ordinary as the guy sitting next to you on the train \u2014 or in Michael Bloomberg\u2019s case, standing beside you on the subway, when he was mayor of New York. (Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on Wealth-X\u2019s list.)There are certainly billionaires who want to save the world, like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bloomberg, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. Others in the top 10 are also philanthropic, but they are still focusing on their day jobs, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Alphabet (the parent of Google) \u2014 Nos. 4, 5 and 10.Yet many of the billionaires beyond the top 10 or 20 have a much lower profile. Who outside of finance or hockey knew of Vincent Viola, a former oil trader and current owner of the Florida Panthers, before President Trump nominated him to be secretary of the Army? Now that he has withdrawn, he can return to relative anonymity.For that matter, Wilbur L. Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, is the wealthiest of the president\u2019s billionaire cabinet picks. He would pop up in the headlines every few years for a deal he was making but then return to what could be called the quiet opulence of the billionaire class.\u201cThey\u2019re different in how they can invest their assets and what their portfolio may look like,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said. \u201cIn many ways, they face different risks, both personal risks and cyber risks, than the average individual does. They often think about structuring decisions differently from a succession-planning standpoint as well as the structure they create around themselves and their family.\u201dYet for most people, billionaires are just wealthy beyond belief. And these days, they are also much wealthier (and getting even more so) than the broader ultra-high-net-worth population.That group is defined as anyone with more than $30 million. In 2015, there were 212,615 of them. On the lower end, the 155,050 people worth between $30 million and $99 million had a combined $8.4 trillion. At the top, the world\u2019s 2,473 billionaires were worth $7.68 trillion.\u201cThere is growing inequality around the world, but there is also inequality among the ultrawealthy,\u201d said Maya Imberg, director of custom research at Wealth-X.Billionaires also matter because of the outsize influence they have, or believe they can have, on policy and public life. They can give millions to a political campaign, as Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, did with Mr. Trump, or as George Soros, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has done with liberal causes.But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group. How they amassed their billions, and how that pile is growing, tells a lot about the economy today.Just as the best teacher in the country is going to earn less money than a mediocre investment banker, the industries in which future billionaires begin their careers determine the magnitude of their wealth and how quickly it is going to grow.Six of the top 10 billionaires made their money in technology. But in Wealth-X\u2019s research, technology ranks sixth overall for the number of billionaires on the list, with 114 around the world.Finance has created the most billionaires, with 377, or 15 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires. It is followed by industrial conglomerates, with 317, or 13 percent.After that, the concentration in particular industries drops. Real estate is third with 141. The group of people who identify their industry as nonprofits (meaning they made their money some other way or inherited it) is fourth, with 122. Manufacturing, in fifth place, has 120.\u201cGlobalization has been a big trend,\u201d said Benjamin Kinnard, a research analyst at Wealth-X. \u201cThe market is now seven billion people, not just the size of your domestic country.\u201dHe added that finance had a bigger lead in first place several years ago, but it has been losing ground as industries like technology boom.A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other people\u2019s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified.The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance.And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts).While the number of billionaires in China is rising at a fast clip, the pace of growth in billionaires worldwide is slowing. Wealth-X said the number will be 3,250 by 2020, down 16 percent from an earlier prediction of 3,873. This is because economic growth is expected to slow around the world.Across the billionaire spectrum, the biggest proportion of billionaires\u2019 wealth \u2014 about half \u2014 is in the business that created the wealth in the first place, according to Wealth-X\u2019s research. After that, they have about a quarter of their money in public securities and a little less than a quarter in cash. Just 4 percent is in real estate and luxury assets, the research found.There are common strains to how they cross the billionaire line, regardless of industry: 57 percent are self-made, according to Wealth-X, and another 31 percent received an inheritance and grew it into billions.\u201cTiming has a lot to do with it,\u201d said John Mathews, head of private wealth management and the ultra-high-net-worth group at UBS. \u201cIf we looked back 100 years, it would have been a really great time to be in steel, railroad or infrastructure businesses. Today, it\u2019s a good time to be in technology and finance.\u201dBut there is a difference from the bottom of the billionaire ladder to the top: Most are on that first rung.Over half of all billionaires are worth between $1 billion and $2 billion. Go up to $5 billion and there are 2,101.And not all billionaires are household names.Ma Jianrong, executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group Holdings, which is the leading textile company in China and manufactures clothing for Nike, Adidas, Puma and Uniqlo, is worth $4.3 billion.Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, built his wealth through mining in South Africa after starting his career as a lawyer in the United States. He is now worth $2.1 billion.Kevin Systrom, chief executive of Instagram, is surely well known in Silicon Valley \u2014 and among students at Stanford University (his alma mater) who want to emulate his route to a net worth of $1.2 billion by age 33. But he is not as recognizable as Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook.But being a billionaire, as opposed to a very wealthy millionaire, can make a huge difference in the loss of privacy for a family. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to be anonymous,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said.And being known as billionaires opens them up to risks, she said, like cybersecurity breaches and attacks on their families.How single-digit billionaires add additional billions isn\u2019t always up to them.One way to become even wealthier is to have picked the right global industry in which to make your billions and hang on to your stake in your company as it booms \u2014 and avoids busts. Right now, the technology and finance industries are leading the growth. Another way is to make your money in the right region, which is Asia.Then, of course, there are the investment opportunities that only get presented to the wealthiest people, and that only they have the resources to take a chance on. \u201cThey can diversify their holdings to protect themselves,\u201d Mr. Kinnard said.And the big investments that are needed in private equity deals, for example, are a smaller portion of overall wealth for billionaires than for someone with, say, $100 million.\u201cThe common thread with billionaires is the incredibly focused drive these people have in whatever business they go into,\u201d Mr. Mathews said. \u201cIt\u2019s dogged determination. You can say everyone is like that, but with billionaires everything else gets blocked out. You see it today with tech the way you saw it with steel barons 100 years ago.\u201dYet getting across the billionaire line does not mean a person will always be there.\u201cOnce a billionaire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stay a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Mathews of UBS said. \u201cLast year alone there were 41 new billionaires created in the United States, but 36 also dropped out of billionaire status in the U.S. Our billionaire population is growing but only by a net of five.\u201dIn the United States, Mr. Mathews said, most people fall off the billionaire list because they sell the company that created their wealth. \u201cWhen you sell it, there are tax issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are estate-planning issues.\u201dThe latter results in chunks of money being given to heirs to get it out of the wealth creator\u2019s estate.Selling family firms happens less often in Europe and Asia. People end up holding on to them and creating family holding companies to continue to operate that original business and expand into others.Of course, people who sell their $1 billion company and end up with $500 million after taxes \u2014 or whose wealth tops out at $800 million \u2014 aren\u2019t scraping by. But being a billionaire gives you entry into an exclusive club that being a millionaire does not. After all, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s wealth from his career at Exxon Mobil looks positively modest. He\u2019s worth just a few hundred million.What is expected of people who have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes? It depends on whom you ask.\u201cIt is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when one in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day,\u201d Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam, said in a statement. \u201cInequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty. It is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.\u201dYet the anger against the superrich has abated since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Protesters seem to be more concerned with the actions of Mr. Trump (who is likely a billionaire, although he has provided little proof of his real wealth) than with his cabinet of plutocrats.Philanthropy has become important to many billionaires, and not just through the Giving Pledge, Mr. Buffett\u2019s compact to get the wealthiest to give away at least half of their fortunes. Nor is it confined to the United States, with its tradition of charitable giving.\u201cWhen I explained to him that New York City\u2019s annual school budget was $22 billion a year,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, \u201cthat was the last time we ever heard from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Living Lab: Reimagining Retail on Seattle Streets", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 On a busy stretch of road in this city\u2019s Ballard neighborhood, a curious new grocery store is taking shape \u2014 and so begins another effort by Amazon to use the residents of its hometown as guinea pigs.Amazon\u2019s success in online commerce has transformed Seattle by bringing jobs, wealth and an almost insatiable appetite for office space \u2014 along with grumbling about how expensive the city is getting. At the same time, the company is putting its stamp on the city by using it as a lab for its expanding array of unconventional experiments in bricks-and-mortar retailing.While Amazon has never articulated the grand strategy behind its expansion into physical stores, analysts and tech executives believe its goal is to capture a bigger share of some forms of shopping \u2014 food being the biggest \u2014 that may never move entirely online.Amazon isn\u2019t alone in using Seattle, home to Starbucks and other major retail brands, as a proving ground for new ideas in stores. But it is the main attraction among people focused on innovation in the category.Amazon declines to talk about the drive-up grocery stores it is building here. The most obvious reason the company tries out new ideas in its own backyard is that it makes life easier for corporate leadership to see them in action without having to get on planes. Executives closely scrutinize how customers use new stores and tweak them as they gather data.Amazon\u2019s own technologically demanding employees are an important part of the feedback process. More than 25,000 of them work for the company in Seattle, and many serve as the first test cases for new concepts.The company opened its first Amazon Go store on the ground floor of one of its office buildings, where employees can buy prepared meals, drinks and snacks. Customers enter the store through a gate with a smartphone app and simply walk out with their goods when they\u2019re done.Almost a decade ago, the company conducted one of its biggest local experiments when it started a grocery home delivery service, tinkering for almost five years before expanding the concept to a new city. Early on, Amazon allowed employees and their friends to use the service, which helped provide unvarnished feedback, said Ian Clarkson, then the general manager of the service, AmazonFresh.Mr. Clarkson recalls a friend telling him that AmazonFresh didn\u2019t stock a brand of orange juice her daughter liked. As a result, she said, she wouldn\u2019t shop through AmazonFresh since she would still need to go to a supermarket for the juice.Seattle has long been receptive to new ideas in retail. REI, Costco Wholesale and Nordstrom are among the store chains that got their start here. Starbucks opened its first coffee house in the Pike Place Market in 1971.Several years ago, it came up with a new idea for building drive-through Starbucks stores out of recycled shipping containers to promote sustainability, trying out the design just south of Seattle before opening others across the country.One of Amazon\u2019s more puzzling retail experiments in Seattle is the Treasure Truck, a roaming delivery truck retrofitted with carnival-style lights and signs, from which customers can pick up items offered during flash sales through the Amazon mobile app. The truck, which seems like the offspring of a billboard and an ice cream truck, has sold wild mahi-mahi steaks, paddle boards and Nintendo game consoles.\u201cSeattleites will say they hate Amazon taking over downtown, but at the same time when Amazon rolls out something special, after everyone complains about it, the first thing people want to do is go check it out,\u201d said Mr. Croft, who says his employment with another technology company doesn\u2019t color his views of Amazon.Not everyone agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t use any Amazon services,\u201d Sherman Alexie, the novelist and poet, who lives in Seattle, wrote in an email.The company\u2019s growth has contributed to a booming economy in its hometown, where the median single-family home price jumped to $548,000 last year from $340,000 five years ago, according to the Northwest Multiple Listing Service.As much as Seattle residents like technology, some say the population is more representative of the rest of the country than shoppers in other cities.\u201cSan Francisco is ludicrously tech-forward,\u201d said Dan Shapiro, the chief executive of a start-up, called Glowforge, that makes a laser cutting device. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me about Seattle is it\u2019s about as tech-friendly and prosperous as you can go without being completely off the rails.\u201dBut Elliott Bay had record sales last year, and he can\u2019t figure out why Amazon, with its size, would bother with the relatively low sales volumes of physical bookstores. Amazon\u2019s global book sales are estimated to be in the billions of dollars, which would dwarf the proceeds from an independent shop.\u201cI know these are very smart people,\u201d Mr. Aaron said. \u201cI assume there\u2019s some kind of design or plan that makes sense. I can\u2019t figure out why they\u2019re doing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the Billionaires Come From", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the early 20th century, a young journalist named Napoleon Hill embarked on the assignment of a lifetime.Mr. Hill set out to study hundreds of the nation\u2019s most successful people and write a book about how they became so accomplished.Mr. Hill spent two decades analyzing the life stories, strategies and personal philosophies of entrepreneurs and industrialists like Henry Ford, William Wrigley and John D. Rockefeller.The resulting book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d was published in 1937 and became a self-help guide for everyday Americans seeking great wealth.Mr. Hill tried to convince his readers \u2014 many of them emotionally and financially battered by the Great Depression \u2014 that with the right attitude they, too, could amass a fortune.\u201cOne must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes first did a certain amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, desiring and planning before they acquired money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Eighty years later, Mr. Hill\u2019s egalitarian notions seem to ring hollow on many levels. There is a troublingly wide gap between the economic fortunes of the rich and the poor \u2014 an inequality that has helped unleash political populism in Europe and the United States. (Ironically, President Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire, rode that resentment to the White House.)The idea that the secret to great wealth comes from a combination of discipline, perseverance and belief in yourself sounds Pollyannaish in an era of widespread disillusionment with how the economy and society actually works.Indeed, the chance of becoming a billionaire remains incredibly slim. Wealth-X, a research firm that tracks global wealth, said there were 2,473 billionaires in 2015, an increase of 148 from the year before and about 0.00003 percent of the world\u2019s 7.3 billion people.Still, an optimist like Mr. Hill, who died in 1970, might take heart in one data point from Wealth-X: More than half of the world\u2019s billionaires are self-made.And that number is increasing. Self-made billionaires represent 57 percent of total billionaire wealth, or more than $4.3 trillion, a figure that was up 7 percent from 2014. Meanwhile, the number of billionaires with inherited wealth \u2014 323, according to Wealth-X \u2014 fell by 29 percent from 2014.The booming technology sector has minted many of the recent self-made titans \u2014 entrepreneurs like Travis Kalanick, a co-founder and the chief executive of Uber, and the co-founders of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk.\u201cMany people have great ideas. But to grow an idea into a huge business is a different matter,\u201d said Maya Imberg, custom research director at Wealth-X. \u201cBillionaires tend to be incredibly focused.\u201dIn his book, Mr. Hill tried to show that qualities like focus and perseverance were within everyone.He told the story of how Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he perfected the incandescent electric light bulb and how Henry Ford pushed his engineers to develop the V-8 motor despite the technical challenges.\u201cA thousand people could be pointed out who have a better education than Ford\u2019s, yet they live in poverty because they do not possess the right plan for the accumulation of money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Wealth-X is the big data equivalent to Mr. Hill\u2019s one-man reporting project. The firm employs about 150 researchers across the world who collect and analyze data about the richest people.Based on that data, you may have a slightly better chance of becoming a billionaire if you went to Harvard, which was the most popular school among billionaires by a wide margin. (Stanford came in second.)Engineering degrees were the most popular among billionaires, followed by business, according to Approved Index, another firm that researches the wealthy. There are some notable billionaires with humanities degrees, like the financier Carl Icahn, who majored in philosophy at Princeton. Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has a teaching degree.It is well known that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft dropped out of Harvard to start their businesses. But they are not alone. About 30 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires never obtain a college degree.\u201cIt is counterintuitive to what you are told growing up,\u201d said Grace Garland, head of research at Approved Index.If the sheer numbers are any guide, your chances of becoming a billionaire as a woman are especially remote. In 2015, 140 of the 148 people who broke into the billionaire ranks were men. All of the top 10 billionaires are men, according to Wealth-X.And yet for all the male-dominated, Ivy League exclusivity of the billionaire\u2019s club, self-help gurus and ordinary people continue to pore over the biographies and public statements of the ultrawealthy, looking for the secret sauce.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, and the investor Warren E. Buffett are said to be avid readers. Mr. Gates once said that \u201creading is still the main way that I both learn new things and test my understanding.\u201dMr. Collins said many of these wealthy men had parents who helped them to succeed.Mr. Gates\u2019 parents arranged for him to take time off from classes during his senior year in high school to work on code for the electrical grid management system at a local power plant.Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of Virgin Group, said his father, a lawyer, taught him the importance of dreaming big and instilled in him a desire for excellence.Mr. Collins said that while he was growing up in Australia, his father made him read \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d and taught him how to think about making money in different ways to accumulate wealth.\u201cThe people who say that entrepreneurs are born, that is ridiculous. They are made,\u201d he said.\u201cYou need grit and unwavering personal confidence. Those are nonnegotiable in a billionaire,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Collectors Take a Turn Toward Cars That Are More Modern", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 \u201cTrois cent mille! Three hundred thousand! Trecentomila!\u201dWith multiple auctioneers frantically yelling out bids in multiple languages, \u201cRetromobile Week\u201d in Paris can sometimes sound like the broadcasters\u2019 booth during a close finish at a Formula One Grand Prix.The Retromobile show, whose 42nd edition closed on Feb. 12, and its accompanying auctions are France\u2019s premier events for anyone interested in buying, selling or simply admiring serious classic cars.The 2017 edition of the show, held in three halls of the sprawling Porte de Versailles exhibition center in southwestern Paris, attracted 118,266 visitors, an 8 percent increase from last year. The crowd was predominantly male and middle-aged, but this year, particularly at the accompanying auctions, younger buyers were increasingly influential players.Retromobile, quite apart from being held in Paris, charms visitors with the quirky diversity of material on show. This year, it included an 1871 steam-driven motorcycle, a World War I French tank, vintage-style crash helmets and model 1960s Ferraris.\u201cThis was pretty standard,\u201d said Laurent Lefebvre, son of the dealership\u2019s founders, Marie-Christine and Oscar Lefebvre. \u201cBut we were meeting new customers, people who have sold their businesses and who want to enjoy life and invest in classic cars. Their average age is not under 45.\u201dThe aging demographic of the classic car world presents a challenge for a collecting field that in recent years has formed a reputation as a high-performing alternative investment.Yet select cars from the 1930s, if they have a distinguished history, still have their admirers. The top price at Bonhams was the \u20ac2 million with fees for an Aston Martin Ulster two-seater that participated in the 1935 Le Mans race. It had been estimated at \u20ac1.6 million to \u20ac1.8 million.More symptomatic of current trends was the sale for the same price (\u20ac2 million) on Feb. 8 at RM Sotheby\u2019s on the Place Vauban for a white 1988 Porsche 959 Sport, one of 29 built by the German marque. That coupe sold for its upper estimate, but an even rarer black 1994 Porsche 911 Turbo S \u2014 one of 17 \u2014 climbed to \u20ac901,600 against a high pre-sale estimate of \u20ac750,000.(Of course, modern Porsches can also be a far more straightforward investment than are lovingly restored older cars, and therefore more appealing to younger collectors.)Predictably, there was rather more excited bidding for a classic \u201cbarn find\u201d in the shape of a 1965 Citro\u00ebn DS 19 Cabriolet that had been photographed next to hay bales and covered in bird droppings. Competition in the room pushed the price to \u20ac101,320, well above the estimate\u2019s high end of \u20ac60,000.Dietrich Hatlapa, founder of the HAGI index, who was in Paris for the auctions, estimated that it would cost at least \u20ac150,000 to properly restore the Citro\u00ebn. \u201cThese cars will always trade for their purchase price plus restorations costs,\u201d he said. But even that might be a little optimistic in the case of this convertible, given that, at Bonhams, a restored 1964 version sold for \u20ac207,000 with fees.\u201cThe danger adds to their reputation,\u201d Mr. Hatlapa said. \u201cThey\u2019re a cool racecar, and yet you can use them to get the paper in the morning.\u201dNeighbors would be well advised to stay indoors for that particular paper run.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rebuilding a Life to Provide a Happier Childhood for Her Son", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Neediest Cases FundAfter an explosive fight with her boyfriend, Melissa Monserrate, 18 at the time and five months pregnant, shut herself in the bathroom and put a razor blade to her wrist. Her boyfriend found her before she could hurt herself.On that night, in December 2009, he stood guard by the door until the morning, making sure she did not leave to try to harm herself again.She had just moved out of her mother\u2019s apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, and begun living with her boyfriend and his family.The pregnancy was unplanned and difficult for Ms. Monserrate, who said she came from an unsupportive home environment. She discovered she was pregnant the summer before her senior year of high school and kept the news from her parents until she could no longer hide it.She missed 60 days of school because of complications from the pregnancy and had to have a minor operation, but worked hard to catch up on missed class. She managed to graduate on time.Much has changed since her son, Xavier Hormaza, 6, was born. \u201cMy son is everything to me,\u201d Ms. Monserrate said. \u201cBut at the time, I wasn\u2019t thinking about my son.\u201dMs. Monserrate, now 25, and her boyfriend are not together anymore.At his house, she recognized the same adversarial environment that she had grown up in, and she wanted to give her son a different childhood from her own. Describing her home life as \u201cvery chaotic,\u201d she recalled arguments between her mother and stepfather that became physical. Once, when a fight escalated, a knife pierced Ms. Monserrate\u2019s bedroom door. Ms. Monserrate covered the hole with a mirror.When fights starting breaking out between Ms. Monserrate and her boyfriend, she decided something had to change.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know I was leaving until I\u2019d left,\u201d she recalled of leaving his apartment on Halloween in 2014, adding that she had not even packed an overnight bag. \u201cThat night I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u2019\u201dShe left her son with her boyfriend and his family, went to stay with a friend in a two-bedroom apartment in Queens, and continued working as a cashier at a CVS.At a co-worker\u2019s urging, she also began therapy last June, finally confronting the troubles from her past that she had long ignored.At first, her financial situation had been secure. When she was 3 and living in an old apartment building, doctors found elevated levels of lead in her bloodstream. She was awarded $100,000 in a lawsuit against the landlord \u2014 accessible as a lump sum when she turned 18. But unaccustomed to such wealth and with a newborn to care for, along with the expense of living on her own and helping family members, Ms. Monserrate had run through the funds by 2015.Struggling to get by on a cashier\u2019s wage of $8.25 an hour, she applied for public assistance and once received $191 in food stamps each month. But now, because she is a full-time student and is unable to work part time, she no longer qualifies for food stamps and her financial situation has been tenuous.\u201cBut I\u2019m still happy I helped my family,\u201d she said.She enrolled in several certification and credentialing programs to bolster her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. She received a certification in retail customer service, learned Microsoft Windows programs and took a public speaking class.After completing her courses at the nonprofit in February 2016 and with the help of her friend at CVS, she enrolled at LaGuardia Community College, where she received financial aid to cover her tuition, and prepared to start classes the next month. But days before classes began, she learned that her textbooks would not be covered by her scholarship. If she could not purchase the books, she would not be able to start until the following semester.\u201cI want to give to people what I didn\u2019t receive for so long,\u201d she said, adding that her time in therapy has helped her move forward from the nightmares of a decade ago.She currently shares an apartment with three roommates in Maspeth, Queens, and pays $370 monthly toward the rent. She worked briefly at her college bookstore and is now looking for a part-time job to help pay off nearly $650 in credit card debt.But while her finances remain shaky, she said her life was finally coming together. She is again taking an active role in raising her son, helping him with school work and playing together in the park.Her dream for her son: \u201cI want my son to have a father figure. I don\u2019t want him to go through life without him. I want him to grow up with two parents that love him and protect him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Everyone in Tech Cheers Visa Program for Foreign Workers", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The \u201cknowledge transfer sessions\u201d started a few months after Jeff Tan received notice last summer that he and about 80 co-workers would be laid off by the University of California, San Francisco, at the end of February.At daily two-hour meetings with employees from HCL Technologies, an Indian tech services company that had landed the outsourcing contract from U.C.S.F., Mr. Tan trained HCL staff members in India by videoconference and employees brought to the United States on H-1B visas how to do his job.But for tech workers like Mr. Tan, the program has had very negative consequences.\u201cI thought the purpose of H-1B visas was to give America a competitive edge, not help companies ship American jobs abroad,\u201d said Mr. Tan, who had worked for the university as an information technology systems administrator for 20 years. \u201cThis is now standard practice in the technology industry.\u201dA research report by Goldman Sachs estimates that 900,000 to a million H-1B visa holders now reside in the United States, and that they account for up to 13 percent of American technology jobs.In 2014, 13 outsourcing firms accounted for one-third of all H-1B visas. They use a loophole in the current first-come, first-served lottery system to flood the applicant pool with their candidates. In many cases, those candidates are paid slightly more than the $60,000-a-year minimum salary required by the program for dependent companies seeking a waiver from having to recruit Americans first \u2014 but less than what American technology workers make.Audrey Hatten-Milholin, 54, was notified in July that she would be laid off from the University of California, San Francisco, at the end of February after 17 years in its technology department. Along with eight others, she filed a complaint in November with California\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, charging that replacing her and others with \u201csignificantly younger, male\u201d workers \u201cwho will then perform the work overseas\u201d was discriminatory.\u201cWe are at a disadvantage as Americans,\u201d Ms. Hatten-Milholin said. \u201cThey look at it like, where can we get it cheaper? And for U.C., it\u2019s not here.\u201dProponents of the H-1B system argue that it is an important vehicle to attract top talent to America. After coming to the United States, these visa holders may apply their skills to start new companies or create new, innovative products \u2014 leading to more jobs in America.The debate over who wins and who loses as a result of the H-1B visa program echoes similar discussions of how free trade helps or hurts the economy. While the benefits are spread broadly throughout the economy, the costs are much more concentrated and easy to identify.After 11 years working in the I.T. department of Northeast Utilities, a Connecticut-based company now named Eversource Energy, Craig Diangelo was among 220 employees laid off in 2014. Before leaving the company, he was told he needed to train his replacement if he wanted to receive his severance.Mr. Diangelo, who is now 64 and was receiving $130,000 a year in salary and bonus, said he trained an employee from the Indian outsourcing firm Infosys who was an H-1B visa holder making $60,000 a year. There was also a team of workers in India making $6,000 a year that shadowed him on the computer.\u201cThe problem,\u201d he said, \u201cis that my job is still there. I went away. The American worker went away.\u201dA representative of Infosys declined to comment. Al Lara, a spokesman for Eversource Energy, said in a statement: \u201cWe made changes to our I.T. department three years ago during a period of transition and change to support the merger of our two companies while under much regulatory scrutiny. We are proud of the new I.T. organization.\u201d Mr. Lara was referring to a merger with NStar in 2012.In other instances, the jobs are filled only temporarily by H-1B workers \u2014 before the outsourcing firm moves the job permanently to a lower-cost country.\u201cThat\u2019s the endgame,\u201d said Sara Blackwell, a lawyer representing former employees of Walt Disney Company, Abbott Laboratories and other companies in discrimination claims pertaining to tech-job outsourcing.\u201cI\u2019m sure employers might not have as much choice as they would like, but if the shortage story were true, we\u2019d see wages rising more rapidly than they are,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. There is substantial unemployment, Mr. Baker said, even among workers in so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.Lawrence F. Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard, said companies like the H-1B visa program because it expands the pool of applicants. That means having to pay less in salary and retaining more control over employees.\u201cFrom the point of view of an economist, there are two big winners,\u201d he added. \u201cThe workers who come here with H-1B visas and the companies that employ them.\u201dWhile it remains to be seen what Mr. Trump will do, various members of Congress have proposed measures to change the H-1B system. One idea is to raise the $60,000-salary threshold for some H-1B workers to $100,000 or more. The hope is that this will narrow the gap between the standard pay for an American tech worker and that of a foreign worker.Another proposed measure is to change the current first-come, first-served lottery system that is benefiting outsourcing firms. Yet another idea is for a salary bidding system, in which companies bid on what they would be willing to pay an applicant, potentially making it more difficult to flood the applicant pool with lower-cost workers.According to the University of California, San Francisco, technology costs to run U.C.S.F. Health, which encompasses the university\u2019s hospital, medical center and patient care facilities, have tripled from 2011 to 2016. Outsourcing technology jobs will save the university more than $30 million over the next five years.But this argument has not spared the university from criticism for outsourcing the jobs because \u2014 as a public institution \u2014 it receives taxpayer funds and is a nonprofit organization.The university said neither it nor HCL would replace the laid-off employees with H-1B workers, although it acknowledges that HCL brought in some H-1B workers initially to understand the institution\u2019s technology needs. Those workers, U.C.S.F. said, are no longer working on the account.Mr. Tan, 55, said he was not worried about returning to the job market in a few weeks and understood why the university took such measures. However, he is concerned about what his children will do when they start looking for work.\u201cToday it\u2019s me, but tomorrow it\u2019s going to be a doctor or an engineer,\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do you draw the line?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the H-1B program\u2019s minimum salary requirement. The minimum salary is for dependent companies that seek a waiver from having to recruit Americans first, not for all companies hiring H-1B candidates.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel Drops Its Sponsorship of Science Fairs, Prompting an Identity Crisis", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is apparently the thinking at Intel, the giant computer chip maker, which is retreating from its longtime sponsorship of science fairs for high school students.Intel\u2019s move away from traditional science fairs leads to broader questions about how a top technology company should handle the corporate sponsorship of science, and what is the best way to promote the education of the tech work force of the future. Intel\u2019s move also raises the issue of the role of science fairs in education in the so-called STEM fields \u2014 science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Intel has not explained its decision, and only said it is \u201cextremely proud\u201d of its long association with the two fairs. The company began supporting the national fair in 1998, taking over from the original sponsor, Westinghouse, and the global competition in 1997, which had no main sponsor.Still, Intel\u2019s move does not suggest a pullback by tech companies in their support for sponsoring science and technology. Google, for example, hosts the Google Science Fair, a global online competition for 13-to-18-year-olds that began in 2011.But as technology \u2014 and the economy \u2014 becomes more based on software, the major companies have broadened support to events like coding workshops and contests.It is hard to imagine a time since the post-Sputnik years when science and technology education has been more valued, by universities and in the labor market. It is also hard to imagine that the leading international science fair, whose roster of participating countries and territories rose to 78 last year, up from 27 in 1997, will not find a deep-pocketed sponsor.The Intel decision provoked a sharp difference of opinion between Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s current chief executive, and Craig R. Barrett, a former Intel chairman and chief executive.Mr. Krzanich has told colleagues privately that the science fairs were the fairs of the past and had become tilted to life sciences and biotechnology, not primary fields for Intel, according to two people who are not authorized to speak publicly for the company.Mr. Barrett disagreed. In an email, he said, \u201cyou might instead conclude that Intel is a company of the past, just like Westinghouse when they dropped\u201d sponsorship of the national science fair in 1998.Mr. Barrett, who is on the board of the Society for Science, also said that all of science has become data-driven and computational, so Intel has a stake in nurturing youthful innovators in all scientific disciplines, including the life sciences.Intel, under Mr. Krzanich, who became chief executive in 2013, has become a major supporter of Maker Faire events, where inventors of all ages showcase their homemade engineering projects. The first Maker Faire was in Silicon Valley in 2006. Last year, more than one million people attended Maker Faire events worldwide.Intel does support other programs to promote STEM education. In 2015, the company pledged $300 million to be spent by 2020 for a fund to diversify its own work force by attracting more women and minorities into technology and paying for college scholarships. Since 2001, the company has contributed an average of $45 million a year to university programs, including research collaborations and scholarships. And Intel is committed to supporting the International Science and Engineering Fair until 2019.Maya Ajmera, president of the Society for Science, praised Intel as \u201can extraordinary partner for the last 20 years,\u201d though she said the company never gave the society a reason for dropping the sponsorship.The society is looking for a sponsor for the international competition who will commit at least $15 million annually for a minimum of five years. It is an opportunity, Ms. Ajmera said, to \u201cinvest in the most important science and technology pipeline in the world.\u201dThe international science contest has a rich legacy. About 60 percent of the participants are American high school students, and its alumni include Paul L. Modrich, a Nobel Prize winner and biochemist at Duke University; Brian Greene, a physicist at Columbia University and a best-selling author; winners of the MacArthur Fellowship, also known as the \u201cgenius\u201d grant; and computer scientists at companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft.Science educators say that science fairs can nurture vital learning and life skills. Students must use critical thinking, experimentation, presentation and speaking skills, and persistence.Struck by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, Mr. Jerath designed an underwater wellhead capping device for taming a gusher and separating oil, gas and water for recycling. His creation won one of the top prizes at the international fair in Pittsburgh in 2015. He has applied for a patent and he has presented his idea to groups as varied as oil companies, the United Nations and young entrepreneur programs.His science fair success, he said, has \u201creally opened up so many doors for me that I had never thought of.\u201dWinning science-fair projects, she said, typically involve consulting mentors and judges, and bouncing ideas off others. That is particularly true of the final event, where 1,800 high school students from more than 70 nations gather to compete for the top prizes. Total student participation in the global competition remains steady, according to the Society for Science.\u201cThe positioning of these research competitions as science fairs can be misleading,\u201d he said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Risky Business for C.E.O.s: An Invitation From Trump", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor the nation\u2019s top executives, a summons to the White House has long been a much-coveted honor.Now, less than a month into President Trump\u2019s administration, it\u2019s become something to be ducked, at least for some.A Trump invitation \u201chas become a double-edged sword because the population is so divided,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who organizes meetings of chief executives there.Then, executives were clamoring to make the cut, even those who had been cool or in some cases hostile to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Well over 100 chief executives approached Mr. Schwarzman and the Trump transition team angling to be included.Only two people declined, citing time pressures: Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.The final list of 16 included such business luminaries as Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric; Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Bob Iger of Disney; Mary Barra of General Motors; and Virginia Rometty of IBM.Soon after, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors, Travis Kalanick of Uber and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo were added, buttressing the group\u2019s expertise in technology and consumer products.Then Mr. Trump was inaugurated and in short order unleashed his divisive immigration order, leading to chaos at airports and nationwide protests. Exactly one week later, on relatively short notice, he convened the first meeting of the forum, with live television coverage from the State Dining Room of the White House.Even though nearly every company represented in the forum issued a statement that to varying degrees distanced it from the immigration order or even denounced it, the images of the meeting risked looking like an endorsement of the Trump administration and its policies.Images of Mrs. Nooyi, an immigrant born in India (and now a citizen), who sat next to Mr. Schwarzman and within camera range of Mr. Trump, seemed especially incongruous.Mr. Kalanick was the first on the forum to feel the wrath of consumers. Protesters accused Uber of \u201ccollaborating\u201d with Mr. Trump and chained themselves to the doors of the company\u2019s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Soon after, the hashtag #DeleteUber trended on Twitter. Within four days of the immigration order, 200,000 users had deleted the Uber app, and one of the company\u2019s rivals, Lyft, reported that downloads of its own app had more than doubled.When I contacted him this week, Mr. Kalanick said: \u201cJoining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.\u201dProtest flared and a social media boycott campaign took root after the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, joined Mr. Trump\u2019s 28-member Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, announced in January, and then praised the president\u2019s pro-business policies on CNBC.Some Disney employees organized demonstrations in three cities this week, demanding that Mr. Iger resign from the forum, even though he didn\u2019t attend the first meeting because of a conflict with a long-scheduled company board meeting. The demonstrations drew about 120 protesters, the company said.At the same time, Out & Equal, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, praised Mr. Iger\u2019s membership in the forum in a letter to the company, citing his support for workplace equality and ability to influence the president.Mr. Schwarzman himself received some criticism from a few Schwarzman scholars, who receive support under a program he established for study in China. In a letter to the scholars explaining his role in advising Mr. Trump, Mr. Schwarzman wrote: \u201cIn life you\u2019ll often find that having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice. However, I have always believed one\u2019s obligation is to work for the common good.\u201dAs the Uber experience suggests, the risks of engaging with Mr. Trump are highest for companies with direct exposure to consumers, especially those who can easily switch to a competitor less identified with the Trump brand. General Motors and PepsiCo could face more consumer reaction; the banks and money managers less so; and industrial concerns like General Electric even less.At the same time, the benefits of being part of the forum and gaining the ear of the president are obvious: Virtually every Fortune 500 corporation has vitally important interests affected by the federal government, from antitrust, labor and trade policies, to tax reform and bank regulation, including changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.The comment seemed to underscore the degree to which Mr. Trump has turned regulation of Wall Street over to the bankers he railed against during the campaign. (Curiously, given Mr. Trump\u2019s stated hostility to Dodd-Frank, Mr. Dimon is on record as supporting many aspects of the legislation, saying it has made the banking system safer but has also made it more difficult for smaller banks to compete.)A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.And refusing Mr. Trump\u2019s invitations risks a presidential Twitter broadside, something that is unprecedented in American political and business history and whose impact is still being assessed. Yahoo Finance last week said it had sifted through more than 34,000 Trump tweets and identified attacks on 62 businesses, including at least two represented in the forum, General Motors and Boeing.(I asked the White House on Thursday for comment on its interaction with business leaders, but received no response.)Optics aside, Mr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said the president\u2019s overtures to executives represented a welcome change from the Obama administration, which largely ignored big business and summoned bankers to Washington to browbeat them publicly over the financial crisis. By comparison, Mr. Trump embraced members of his business forum as \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d and said he welcomed their ideas.\u201cThere\u2019s always the danger that chief executives will be used as photo ops,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld acknowledged. But he praised Mr. Trump\u2019s decision \u201cto give chief executives a seat at the table\u201d and said he had talked to at least half of the participants since the meeting. \u201cThey\u2019re telling me they found him very receptive to their ideas and willing to listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve said they\u2019re holding each other accountable to be truthful and candid and to raise key issues with him.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld has met with Mr. Trump since the election and offered advice. \u201cHe\u2019s very charming and open to new ideas,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen business executives melt in his presence.\u201dCharles Elson, a professor and expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware, also praised the president for reaching out to business leaders. He said he disagreed with Mr. Kalanick\u2019s decision to resign.\u201cWhen the president calls, you should go to see him, regardless of your political persuasion, out of respect for the office,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cAs a chief executive with a duty to your shareholders, it\u2019s your obligation to do so, like him or not.\u201dMr. Schwarzman\u2019s office made a similar point when I inquired this week. \u201cSteve has advised presidents from both parties in the past and feels a duty to help any administration that calls on him if he\u2019s able to do so for the good of the country,\u201d Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzman, said.Still, everyone I spoke to agreed that there were lines they wouldn\u2019t cross. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree\u201d with the president, Mr. Elson said. \u201cIf he asks you to take a political position, you can say no. And if he asks you to endorse something where you have a deep philosophical objection, you shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Ignored Trump News for a Week. Here\u2019s What I Learned.", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didn\u2019t read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president.It wasn\u2019t my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours), but shifted most of my energy to looking for Trump-free zones.My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no Trump-free part of the press.But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosystem. Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever. The reasons have as much to do with him as the way social media amplifies every big story until it swallows the world. And as important as covering the president may be, I began to wonder if we were overdosing on Trump news, to the exclusion of everything else.The new president doesn\u2019t simply dominate national and political news. During my week of attempted Trump abstinence, I noticed something deeper: He has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind, political or not. He is no longer just the message. In many cases, he has become the medium, the ether through which all other stories flow.Obviously, just about every corner of the news was a minefield, but it was my intention to keep informed while avoiding Mr. Trump. I still consulted major news sites, but avoided sections that tend to be Trump-soaked, and averted my eyes as I scrolled for non-Trump news. I spent more time on international news sites like the BBC, and searched for subject-specific sites covering topics like science and finance. I consulted social news sites like Digg and Reddit, and occasionally checked Twitter and Facebook, but I often had to furiously scroll past all of the Trump posts. (Some news was unavoidable; when Mr. Flynn resigned, a journalist friend texted me about it.)Even when I found non-Trump news, though, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a fruit-and-nut cake without getting any fruit or nuts.Where else could I go? Snapchat and Instagram were relatively safe, but the president still popped up. Even Amazon.com suggested I consider Trump toilet paper for my wife\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day present. (I bought her jewelry.)All presidents are omnipresent. But it is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now. It\u2019s possible that not even the most famous or infamous people of the recent or distant past \u2014 say, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali or Adolf Hitler \u2014 dominated media as thoroughly at their peak as Mr. Trump does now.I\u2019m hedging because there isn\u2019t data to directly verify this declaration. (Of course, there are no media analytics to measure how many outlets were covering Hitler the day he invaded Poland.) But there is some pretty good circumstantial evidence.Consider data from mediaQuant, a firm that measures \u201cearned media,\u201d which is all coverage that isn\u2019t paid advertising. To calculate a dollar value of earned media, it first counts every mention of a particular brand or personality in just about any outlet, from blogs to Twitter to the evening news to The New York Times. Then it estimates how much the mentions would cost if someone were to pay for them as advertising.In January, Mr. Trump broke mediaQuant\u2019s records. In a single month, he received $817 million in coverage, higher than any single person has ever received in the four years that mediaQuant has been analyzing the media, according to Paul Senatori, the company\u2019s chief analytics officer. For much of the past four years, Mr. Obama\u2019s monthly earned media value hovered around $200 million to $500 million. The highest that Hillary Clinton got during the presidential campaign was $430 million, in July.It\u2019s not just that Mr. Trump\u2019s coverage beats anyone else\u2019s. He is now beating pretty much everyone else put together. Mr. Senatori recently added up the coverage value of 1,000 of the world\u2019s best known figures, excluding Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. The list includes Mrs. Clinton, who in January got $200 million in coverage, Tom Brady ($38 million), Kim Kardashian ($36 million), and Vladimir V. Putin ($30 million), all the way down to the 1,000th most-mentioned celebrity in mediaQuant\u2019s database, the actress Madeleine Stowe ($1,001).The coverage those 1,000 people garnered last month totaled $721 million. In other words, Mr. Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1,000 famous people put together. And he is on track to match or beat his January record in February, according to Mr. Senatori\u2019s preliminary figures.\u201cFrom a media perspective, it\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d Mr. Senatori said. \u201cThe sheer volume, and the sheer amount of consumption, and all the new channels that are available today show that, yeah, he\u2019s off the charts.\u201dMr. Trump is a historically unusual president, and thus deserves plenty of coverage. Yet there\u2019s an argument that our tech-fueled modern media ecosystem is amplifying his presence even beyond what\u2019s called for.There\u2019s a reason you aren\u2019t seeing these stories splashed across the news. Unlike old-school media, today\u2019s media works according to social feedback loops. Every story that shows any signs of life on Facebook or Twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet, becoming unavoidable.Mr. Watts and his colleagues found that adding social signals changed the music people were interested in. Inequality went up: When people could see what others were downloading, popular songs became far more popular, and unpopular songs far less popular. Social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes; when people could see how others had picked songs, the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success, and bad songs were more likely to become popular.I suspect we are seeing something like this effect playing out with Trump news. It\u2019s not that coverage of the new administration is unimportant. It clearly is. But social signals \u2014 likes, retweets and more \u2014 are amplifying it.It\u2019s only been a month since Mr. Trump took office, and already the deluge of news has been overwhelming. Everyone \u2014 reporters, producers, anchors, protesters, people in the administration and consumers of news \u2014 has been amped up to 11.For now, this might be all right. It\u2019s important to pay attention to the federal government when big things are happening.But Mr. Trump is likely to be president for at least the next four years. And it\u2019s probably not a good idea for just about all of our news to be focused on a single subject for that long.In previous media eras, the news was able to find a sensible balance even when huge events were preoccupying the world. Newspapers from World War I and II were filled with stories far afield from the war. Today\u2019s newspapers are also full of non-Trump articles, but many of us aren\u2019t reading newspapers anymore. We\u2019re reading Facebook and watching cable, and there, Mr. Trump is all anyone talks about, to the exclusion of almost all else.There\u2019s no easy way out of this fix. But as big as Mr. Trump is, he\u2019s not everything \u2014 and it\u2019d be nice to find a way for the media ecosystem to recognize that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Sense of Dread\u2019 for Civil Servants Shaken by Trump Transition", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Across the vast federal bureaucracy, Donald J. Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House has spread anxiety, frustration, fear and resistance among many of the two million nonpolitical civil servants who say they work for the public, not a particular president.At the Environmental Protection Agency, a group of scientists strategized this past week about how to slow-walk President Trump\u2019s environmental orders without being fired.At the Treasury Department, civil servants are quietly gathering information about whistle-blower protections as they polish their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.At the United States Digital Service \u2014 the youthful cadre of employees who left jobs at Google, Facebook or Microsoft to join the Obama administration \u2014 workers are debating how to stop Mr. Trump should he want to use the databases they made more efficient to target specific immigrant groups.The New York Times would like to hear from President Trump\u2019s supporters: What do you think about his policies so far?\u201cIt\u2019s almost a sense of dread, as in, what will happen to us,\u201d said Gabrielle Martin, a trial lawyer and 30-year veteran at the Denver office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where colleagues now share daily, grim predictions about the fate of their jobs under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201cIt\u2019s like the movie music when the shark is coming,\u201d Ms. Martin said, referring to \u201cJaws,\u201d the 1975 thriller. \u201cPeople are just wary \u2014 is the shark going to come up out of the water?\u201dThis article is based on interviews around the country with more than three dozen current and recently departed federal employees from the Internal Revenue Service; the Pentagon; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Justice and Treasury Departments; the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development; and other parts of the government. They reveal a federal work force that is more fundamentally shaken than usual by the uncertainties that follow a presidential transition from one party to the other.Federal workers are more likely to be Democrats, according to surveys. But partisanship and ideology explain only some of the intense feelings among workers, many of whom have seen Democrats and Republicans in the White House come and go.At bars after work, in employee break rooms, on conference calls and on social media networks, employees at agencies targeted for steep reductions fear for their jobs. They worry about Mr. Trump\u2019s freeze on hiring and regulations, his pledge to reverse environmental protections, and his executive order shutting down immigration for refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.Some federal workers welcome Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to create new jobs, build infrastructure and lower taxes. Others say they are focusing on doing their jobs and trying not to be distracted by the political noise that surrounds them. Still others say they are struggling with the question of whether they want to work for a president with whom they so strongly disagree.\u201cWhat do you do,\u201d asked Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, if you work at a place where the leader \u201cavowedly renounces the work of that agency?\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden, you are faced with a real moral dilemma,\u201d continued Mr. Connolly, whose district just outside Washington is home to thousands of federal workers.Federal workers watched with growing alarm last year as Mr. Trump waged a campaign filled with antigovernment bombast and then during a transition in which he recruited cabinet secretaries hostile to the agencies they lead. Now they wait in these chaotic early days of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency as he and his political advisers use executive orders to shred the policies and traditions the workers have championed.The intensity of feeling was already raw in late December, when members of the Digital Service gathered for drinks at the Laughing Man Tavern, a Washington bar, to say goodbye to Mikey Dickerson, their boss and the Google engineer first hired to rescue HealthCare.gov, the government\u2019s Affordable Care Act website.Mr. Dickerson had recruited many of them to overhaul outdated government systems and databases, with the goal of helping President Barack Obama open the country\u2019s doors to refugees, protect immigrants, aid veterans and improve health care. Now, he said, those who choose to stay will be building better tools for the agenda of Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is a crisis moment,\u201d Mr. Dickerson told his staff that night, according to a rough transcript of his remarks. \u201cThe coalition that brought us all together for a while is broken, because the values that we have all prioritized differently are now pointing in different directions.\u201dFour days after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers \u2014 Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell \u2014 attended the Digital Service\u2019s staff meeting. The pair, who are close to Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, told the nearly 100 staff members that their expertise was valued by the president; Mr. Kushner; Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist; and others in the West Wing.The message was meant to provide reassurance. But several members of the team said it had the opposite effect. One employee who still works there said it was the moment she realized their combined technological prowess would be harnessed for a new purpose.\u201cAt that moment, when folks heard the name Steve Bannon, it was like a punch in the gut. It became so real,\u201d said the employee, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.Career employees are particularly nervous at the E.P.A., which Mr. Trump repeatedly singled out for attack on the campaign trail, vowing at one point to \u201cget rid of\u201d the agency. On Monday, about 100 employees at the agency\u2019s Chicago office, which oversees the enforcement of environmental regulations in five Midwestern states, used their lunch hour to protest the Senate\u2019s confirmation of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the agency. Mr. Pruitt was a fierce critic of its mission under Mr. Obama.\u201cI have been through several transitions, but I have never had or seen this level of alarm,\u201d said Nicole Cantello, an E.P.A. lawyer in the Chicago office, who heads the Chicago-area union of the agency\u2019s employees.Ms. Cantello, who has worked for the E.P.A. prosecuting cases since 1990, said that during the George W. Bush administration, some career employees had quietly bristled at more industry-friendly environmental regulations. But at no point did they feel the alarm they do now, she said.\u201cUnless there\u2019s an abject abandoning of E.P.A.\u2019s role in the world, we\u2019ll do what we\u2019re told to do,\u201d she said.In a video to E.P.A. employees this past week, the acting administrator, Catherine R. McCabe, acknowledged that \u201cmany of you are concerned about\u201d reports that climate change data had been removed from the department\u2019s websites.\u201cI would like to allay the fears and rumors that scientific data and information are being deleted,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not the case.\u201dDespite such reassurances, the concerns of federal employees are being spread across social media, on accounts with names like \u201c@Rogue_DOD,\u201d \u201c@Alt_DeptofEd\u201d and \u201c@AngryWHStaffer.\u201d One anonymous Twitter user created \u201c@WhitehouseLeaks,\u201d with a purported mission to reveal the secret workings of the Trump administration from within the West Wing.Many federal employees recoiled at reports that the president was about to issue an executive order rolling back certain rights for lesbians, gays and transgender people.\u201cThere was a group of people who were planning some public display of protest with the purpose of leaving,\u201d a federal employee in Washington said. Another official, who worked at Treasury until this past week, said his friends would have considered that order \u201cthe last straw\u201d and most likely would have quit. The president did not issue such an order.More than 1,000 State Department diplomats registered their opposition to the ban by signing a dissent letter asserting that the new policy would \u201crun counter to core American values\u201d and would not make the country safer.At the Defense Department, where uniformed men and women work with civilians, several rank-and-file employees expressed outrage that Mr. Trump would announce the travel ban at the Pentagon, a building filled with people from different faiths and countries. That same day, the Defense Department posted a message on Twitter about a former refugee who became a Marine. \u201cFrom refugee to #Marine. @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes his fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out,\u201d it read.Helene Cooper, Coral Davenport and Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
