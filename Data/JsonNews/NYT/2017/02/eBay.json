{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Look Now, but the Great Unbundling Has Spun Into Reverse", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe internet promised to be the great unbundler. The evisceration of distribution costs would free consumers from paying for cable television channels they never watched, allowing them to bypass cable monopolies and pay only for the shows they wanted. No longer would anyone have to buy a $99-a-month triple-play package when all they wanted was the History Channel.Over the last two decades, consumers have felt liberated as traditional bundles unraveled \u2014 from music to media to retail.For instance, Craigslist and myriad other digital start-ups siphoned lucrative job and real estate listings from traditional newspaper bundles. Meanwhile, media firms held onto the economically challenged business of delivering news and entertainment.Proponents of the breakdown of the bundle economy most often cite cable television. Superficially, the evidence is compelling: In the last six years, pay TV penetration has declined from about 90 percent to 80 percent of homes \u2014 with more than two million homes cutting the cord in the last couple of years alone.But paradoxically, the same forces that allowed classified ads and news to be so easily separated also drastically increased the economic rationale for bundling across the board.Consumers merely have swapped one bundle for another (or often, several). There are more than 65 million subscribers to cheaper \u201cover the top\u201d packages provided by Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Sling TV and others (even excluding Amazon Prime Video). One does not always think of all of these as \u201cbundles\u201d because these services do not consistently categorize their content using the commonplace TV channel taxonomy. However, their aggregation of shows looks more and more like a traditional cable bundle.We are in the age of the great rebundling, when firms use packages of services as a way to increase their scale advantage and thus deepen the moat around their businesses.In music, the story is even starker than in television. At one time, consumers used to buy a collection of songs \u2014 on vinyl, cassette and then compact disc. It was possible to buy a single song or two in these formats, but the internet facilitated more and more people downloading individual tracks.Yet, today, there is an inexorable consumer shift to all-you-can-eat bundles of music. Already more than 60 million people pay for Spotify, Apple Music and others. These music bundles will increasingly be combined with other services as well to build competitive advantage. This newspaper currently includes Spotify with certain new subscriptions. And it is easy to see how Google and Apple will increasingly integrate music packages into their broader suite of services (as Amazon already has).Bundling has always worked well for products for which consumers have widely varying tastes and willingness to pay. The magic of bundle economics allows consumers to get more for less, while also maximizing revenue for the provider. Imagine that there are two hungry diners at a burger joint where the restaurant\u2019s marginal cost of food is zero-ish. One customer is willing to fork over $5 for a burger and $1 for fries. The other will shell out $5 for fries but only $1 for a burger. By selling a la carte, the restaurant maximizes revenue by pricing each item at $5. Both consumers leave hungry, and the business takes in $10. However, both diners would snap up a $6 bundle, allowing them to sate their appetites while shelling out $12 in total. Everyone is better off (perhaps not healthwise).In the digital environment, two additional forces are driving this tidal wave of digital bundling.First, the near-zero marginal cost of distribution makes all-you-can-eat packages compelling. Even heavy users of streaming services can potentially be profitable customers if the underlying economics of rights payments are well managed.The Federal Communications Commission appears to be relaxing its position on the bundling of data and services. The agency had been investigating the practice of \u201czero-rating,\u201d whereby a wireless carrier like T-Mobile allows its subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data cap. Recently, the F.C.C. dropped this investigation \u2014 believing that this kind of bundling is now commonplace in a competitive market. Plainly this is the thin edge of the wedge for net neutrality. Connectivity and cloud computing services will most likely start to include \u201cunrated\u201d services to differentiate themselves further from other commodity providers. In the short term, this shift will most likely be a boon for consumers. Time will tell whether this stifles long-range innovation \u2014 especially in bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming.Second, firms need to mitigate the high cost of attracting and retaining online consumers. Netflix can amortize the expense of acquiring and servicing a subscriber over the hundreds of dollars of revenue they will generate if they hang around for a couple of years. Selling individual shows for a few bucks a pop would be vastly more expensive in marketing, billing and service costs.Tying several services together (even when they are not all directly complementary) increases customer loyalty. Amazon Prime has more than 66 million subscribers. Just a few years ago, it was mostly a free-shipping service. Now, it includes an extensive library of free e-books, videos and music. The large base of Prime subscribers makes life hard for would-be Amazon competitors \u2014 who have to contend not just with Amazon\u2019s scale in any particular vertical but also the combined value of the eclectic products and services that Amazon bundles together. This value may also increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning help personalize these applications. Walmart may be four times larger than Amazon in retail, but Amazon\u2019s bundle magnifies the impact of its size, reducing its scale disadvantage.For insurgents, this trend complicates the already formidable challenge of competing with the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple \u2014 all of which have been adept at weaving various interconnected services together to magnify their scale advantage.Technology investors are obsessed with network effects. These help make firms like Facebook and eBay so valuable \u2014 because additional users increase utility for everyone, making it hard for upstarts to compete. But investors often forget that network effects are just a subset of scale advantages. Superior scale is what protects most businesses from competition. It would be hard to start a business to take on Coca-Cola because of its size advantage \u2014 especially in local bottling, distribution and marketing.During the road show for the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape, its chief executive, Jim Barksdale, famously commented that there are \u201conly two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.\u201d For many firms, the bundle is not a decaying symbol of legacy distribution. Rather, it is the new network effect: a critical strategy to amplify scale in the hope of building or deepening a moat to protect against foes everywhere.Jeremy G.

{"Headline": "Selling My Vintage Watch: A Journey in Time", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI inherited a Patek Philippe watch from my husband. He had never worn it, it had been his father\u2019s and it wasn\u2019t running: That pretty much sums up what I knew about the timepiece.Except that I knew I wanted to sell it.Such a simple idea, but just how do you go about selling a watch?Some friends said to sell it on eBay, but I had no idea what kind of Patek Philippe I had, what shape it was in or how much to ask for it. I did know that there were websites, stores and auction houses that sold watches. But which would give me the best price? And did I have to get the watch fixed first?The company authenticated the watch: It was a Calatrava with an unusual roulette, or sector, dial. I was shown a copy of the original papers documenting its initial sale in 1937 in New York. The strap, which was in poor condition, was not original. Then came a series of inspections to determine what would be needed to get it running again.The verdict: It was nothing that 11,500 Swiss francs (about $11,460) couldn\u2019t fix.After I regained my composure, I decided to take the timepiece to other vendors for their opinions.I heard from one after another that if I wanted to keep the watch, I should get it fixed \u2014 and fixed by Patek Philippe, using authentic parts, to maintain its value. But if I wanted to sell it, it did not have to be repaired. It seems as if all serious watch collectors have their own personal watchmaker tucked away somewhere in the Swiss mountains to work on new acquisitions.Along the way, I learned a lot about selling a timepiece \u2014 and some interesting things about watches themselves.Having marveled at the five-, six- and even seven-figure watch sales coming out of the famed auction houses, I decided to start at the top. Climbing the narrow cobblestone streets of Geneva\u2019s Old Town, I arrived at the local Christie\u2019s offices. Sabine Kegel, a senior watch specialist, was waiting, loupe in hand.Ms. Kegel began with the watch\u2019s assets: \u201cIt\u2019s a rare sector dial, very unusual, very nice,\u201d she said. And she noted the gold marks on the case. \u201cIt\u2019s historically interesting, being in the same family since 1937,\u201d she said.Then she pointed out the negatives. \u201cIt\u2019s small for today,\u201d she said. \u201cMen want bigger watches.\u201d The timepiece had been cleaned at some point, \u201cwhich softened some of the letters on the dial,\u201d she said. And it was yellow gold; white metals are more popular now.If I wanted to auction off the watch, Ms. Kegel said, her watchmaker could clean the movement and the case. But \u201cit\u2019s in good condition as it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s running.\u201d This was a surprise to me, as it hadn\u2019t been running before. Perhaps the Patek examination had jostled something: Winding seemed to be all it needed now.She assured me that the cost of the conditioning, which I would have to pay, would be much less than 11,500 francs, but she couldn\u2019t say how much less. Christie\u2019s would pay to replace the worn strap with a Patek Philippe strap. And then the watch would be taken on tour to Dubai, Hong Kong and Taipei (which, she said, are especially good markets for smaller watches) before being auctioned. She estimated that it would fetch 8,000 to 12,000 francs.But a sale at Christie\u2019s or any other auction house could involve other costs that I\u2019d have to assume, like insurance, catalog photography, customs charges and shipping. And there would be a commission, which is usually 6 percent to 20 percent of the final sale price.Christie\u2019s also does not specify a reserve price for watches valued at less than 10,000 francs, Ms. Kegel later told me in an email.Without a guarantee that the watch wouldn\u2019t be sold for less than I thought it was worth, I decided to pass \u2014 despite the exciting thought of my little watch touring the world.Mr. Bacs pointed out the \u201cwonderfully crisp\u201d gold mark of the goddess Helvetia on the case. He said that the strap had been made by Kreisler, a 20th-century New York jewelry company known for its leather watch bands.He took the watch apart, exposing what he called its \u201cbeautiful\u201d movement. And he found a tiny scratch, invisible to the naked eye, where, he said, \u201ca watchmaker had used the wrong size implement and it slipped.\u201d He took a photo to show me the damage magnified to 50 times its actual size, but he said the scratch was just part of the watch\u2019s patina and should not be a concern.He also spoke of the horrors of having a watch improperly cleaned: \u201cIt\u2019s like an 85-year-old movie star who wants to look 25. The original with flaws is better than something over-restored.\u201dHis advice was to leave it as is. \u201cIt\u2019s got its charm,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\u2019s someone who will love that lovely roulette dial.\u201d He priced it at 5,000 to 7,000 francs. But, noting that an auction would most likely be a costly undertaking for small gain, he recommended that I look into a private sale.A good watch store was starting to seem like a good idea.Although the Patek Philippe store on the Rue du Rh\u00f4ne does not sell vintage watches, I stopped by to get some insight from the manager, Patrick Cremers.After echoing other opinions \u2014 lovely dial, small size \u2014 Mr. Cremers made an interesting observation: The buckle was 16 millimeters (about 0.6 inches), too big for the watch. When I replaced the strap, he said, I should get a 14-millimeter buckle, which would be more in proportion. Mr. Cremers said it was unfortunate that I did not have the original box or certificate of origin, which he said could increase the value by as much as 15 percent. \u201cThe full package makes the watch\u2019s story more beautiful,\u201d he said.In the end, he suggested that I sell the watch online, estimating that I would get 8,000 to 10,000 francs.I then asked the concierge at the well-known Beau Rivage hotel to recommend a respected multibrand watch boutique, and he suggested La Maison de l\u2019Horlogerie. So I went, unannounced, to the shop on the Rue du Cendrier and spoke with the manager, Alain Guttly.He offered two solutions: The store could sell the watch on consignment or buy it outright for resale. Either way, I would have to order a certificate of authenticity from Patek Philippe at a cost of about 100 francs \u2014 no big deal.Then his watchmaker would evaluate the watch, which had been running intermittently in recent days. \u201cNinety-five percent of our customers want a watch that works properly,\u201d Mr. Guttly said. \u201cWe guarantee that the watch works, unlike an auction house.\u201d\u201cIf it will cost 4,000 francs to repair the watch, we would not be interested,\u201d he said, as he estimated that the watch would sell for 5,000 to 7,000 francs. He recommended that I sell it at auction.Over coffee at a cafe overlooking the Jet d\u2019Eau fountain, Gr\u00e9gory Gardinetti, historian for the watch industry\u2019s Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, suggested another sales method: a dedicated forum for Patek collectors.\u201cYou could find collectors of Calatravas, and your watch might be the missing piece in their collection,\u201d he said. He had sold his old Rolex that way.But, I pointed out, I\u2019m not a watch expert. I wouldn\u2019t know how to describe or price the watch.Mr. Gardinetti then suggested that I sell the watch online: \u201cYou\u2019ll get the best price, without a lot of ancillary costs,\u201d he said. He recommended I talk with Iconeek, a new company nearby.A few minutes later I climbed the stairs of a small office building on the Place de Longemalle and met Vanessa and Fabien Chicha, the founders of the online watch sale site Iconeek, who both have extensive experience working with top watch brands, including Omega and auction houses like Christie\u2019s.Mr. Chicha praised my watch as \u201can iconic Patek\u201d and the sort of \u201cvirgin\u201d watch that collectors want.He said he would put the watch in working order; I would pay for a new strap and buckle. Then they would photograph it and put it on their site, with a reserve price of 5,000 francs. They estimated that it would sell for 6,000 to 7,000 francs; they would take a 15 percent commission. This was sounding good.Ninety percent of the watches the site offers are sold within two days, Mr. Clymer said. As of early February, Hodinkee had sold 340 watches at an average price of $8,000.They offered to have their watchmaker ensure that the timepiece was working well and change the strap. (\u201cWe have over 100 Herm\u00e8s-style straps,\u201d a classic style of watchband, Ms. Barrett said.) They would photograph the watch and promote it on their website and Instagram sites.They would price the watch at $7,500. Commissions vary, but the one for my watch would be 15 percent. So if it sold, I\u2019d get $6,375. I was tempted.But not before considering the private-collector option. Mr. Bacs had suggested that I talk with a colleague of his in New York, Paul Boutros, international strategy adviser at Phillips and the head of its watch department for the Americas. He said he felt sure that Mr. Boutros would have someone for me.Mr. Boutros did. Sitting in his glass-walled office overlooking Park Avenue, he said he had a buyer but wouldn\u2019t identify the person. Nor would he specify the commission \u2014 but the buyer, not I, would pay it.So the price that Mr. Boutros suggested, $6,200, would be mine \u2014 pure and simple.Done.A week or so later, Mr. Clymer discovered a photo of my watch on Instagram and sent a link to me. The watch had been bought by John Lydon, a vintage watch dealer in New Hampshire. Why?\u201cI was interested in its story, that it had always been in the same family,\u201d Mr. Lydon said in a telephone interview. He was also seduced by the sector dial and its hard raised enamel.\u201cThe watch appeared to be running well, so I haven\u2019t had any work done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt currently rests in my safe deposit box. My wife or one of my granddaughters may end up wearing it.\u201dThe photograph on Mr. Lydon\u2019s Instagram page got more than 100 likes, as well as comments that included \u201cMagnificent!\u201d \u201cStunning!\u201d \u201cFantastic!\u201d and \u201cWOW!!!\u201dI should have asked for more money.An earlier version of this article misstated the way viewers interacted with a picture on Instagram. The photograph received over 100 likes, not comments.An earlier version of this article misspelled, in one instance, the surname of a watch dealer. He is John Lydon, not Lyndon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "His Art Is on the Oxxo Shelves. Keep Your Receipt.", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor his newest project, which opened here on Wednesday, Feb. 8, he has transformed the Kurimanzutto gallery into a fully stocked and operating Oxxo convenience store, complete with cash registers, clerks, a coffee counter and the usual mix of candy, condoms, soda and toilet paper. Except that Mr. Orozco has added his own colorful logos to an array of 300 goods, from cans of Dos Equis beer and Jumex juice to packs of Camel cigarettes and Orbit gum \u2014 with all products for sale.It\u2019s an example of Mr. Orozco mining, as he has long done, everyday social exchanges and encounters. And it\u2019s a vast experiment in art merchandising that raises questions about art as a commodity to be traded, while trying to make the gallery experience accessible and affordable to more people.Prices for his \u201cproducts\u201d will change over time and with demand, according to a complicated set of rules. In standard gallery pricing, the cost of \u201cmultiples\u201d like prints and photographs typically escalates as the edition sells out.But in this case, with edition sizes for each artwork ranging from three to 10, prices start at $15,000 (close to usual gallery fees for blue-chip collectors who seek first choice and possibly a monopoly on a particular product line). They drop over time to $60 (closer to the cost of a shopping trip to Oxxo) on the project\u2019s final day, March 16.\u201cI see this as a game \u2014 a bizarre, playful game, with elements of Monopoly, chess, go and maybe backgammon,\u201d said Mr. Orozco, whose unruly gray hair and nubby wool jacket give him a hip-professor look. On a break from installation in the \u201cstore,\u201d where assistants were applying stickers to packages, Mr. Orozco was talking, pacing and smoking in the Kurimanzutto courtyard outside the official red-and-yellow Oxxo entrance sign, which has the graphic punch of the best Pop Art.\u201cIt\u2019s a way of collapsing in the same physical space two different systems \u2014 the art market, which is about exclusivity and high prices, and the market for everyday consumer goods with their mass availability and low prices,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in the turbulence that creates.\u201dA dense circular chart designed by Mr. Orozco tracks sales and availability. If every possible piece were to sell, the gross revenue would be around $5 million.So is this the latest example of a moneymaking machine by an artist putting his stamp on everything in the spirit of great art-world branders like Damien Hirst and Andy Warhol?He shook his head, noting that profits are not the only goal. \u201cThis is really a gamble,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gallery is gambling because they don\u2019t need to get into this absurd system of prices that gives them a headache already. I\u2019m gambling because I can lose face if my system is a failure. And I think consumers will need a bit of faith, too.\u201d\u201cIf the system works, everyone wins and walks away with something of value,\u201d he added. \u201cIf not, at least people can walk away with a nice little work of mine that I hope they will like and put on a shelf.\u201dMr. Orozco is not the only artist to riff on a convenience store, with Claes Oldenburg opening a storefront on the Lower East Side of New York for a month in 1961 to sell sculptural versions of cigarettes, candy bars and other everyday items. In 2007, the Chinese multimedia artist Xu Zhen filled an exhibition called \u201cShanghART Supermarket\u201d with empty products in a critique of globalization, inviting visitors to buy them or question their true value.Mr. Orozco said he had the idea for his project six months ago while living in Tokyo, \u201cthe capital of convenience stores.\u201d He started thinking about Oxxo\u2019s popularity in Mexico, where it has 14,700 branches and opens roughly 25 more every week.And Mr. Orozco, 54, easily ranks as the most successful contemporary art export from Mexico \u2014 moving back and forth with his wife and 12-year-old son among New York, Tokyo, Paris and Mexico, with his next stretch planned for Bali.He gained recognition while living in New York in the 1990s by making humble or ephemeral artworks, finding value in the disposable. For the 1993 work \u201cHome Run,\u201d he arranged for neighbors in high rises facing the Museum of Modern Art to place oranges in their windows, so the bursts of color were visible from the museum. The same year, he placed the empty white shoe box in the Venice Biennale. The next year, he nailed four clear Dannon yogurt lids to four walls of the Marian Goodman gallery.This early work, sometimes grouped with Rirkrit Tiravanija and Maurizio Cattelan under \u201crelational aesthetics,\u201d proved hugely influential. One sign of its power was that critics expressed feelings tantamount to romantic betrayal when Mr. Orozco shifted in 2004 to exhibiting paintings: colored diagrams using circle fragments in a 2-1 or 1-2 pattern of a knight\u2019s movement on a chess board. At Mr. Orozco\u2019s 2009 MoMA retrospective, Jerry Saltz, the critic for New York magazine, dismissed his paintings as high-end screen savers \u2014 \u201ccontrived, unimaginative, banal, and risk-free,\u201d essentially calling Mr. Orozco a sellout.The Oxxo project can be read as a response to such critics, with Mr. Orozco combining the circle diagrams with a transparent, even defiant, exploration of art as commodity through a familiar item like a Pepsi can, his logo playing off its famous waves.Jessica Morgan, the director of the Dia Art Foundation, who previously worked with Mr. Orozco at the Tate Modern, calls \u201cthe circulation of things in everyday life\u201d a major theme in his work. \u201cHe takes very big ideas about movement and distribution and makes it all personal, tangible and often quite beautiful.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s managed to marry a conceptual practice with a real interest in object-making,\u201d she added. \u201cHe makes very tactile work \u2014 you always want to touch it even if you shouldn\u2019t.\u201dThe project also reflects Mr. Orozco\u2019s other longtime interests, including rescuing disposable goods. \u201cI am in a way merchandising trash,\u201d he offered, drinking coffee from an Oxxo cup. \u201cI\u2019m selling the byproducts of Oxxo \u2014 the empty cans, bottles and packages that normally end up in the garbage.\u201dHe is also working with the form of the gallery itself, as he did in 1995 in Antwerp, Belgium. There he transformed the Szwajcer gallery into a small parking garage after noticing that his dealer did not have a legal parking space. His drawings hung on walls behind the cars.The Oxxo project relates to his early retail interventions. He came up with the concept for Kurimanzutto\u2019s inaugural show in 1999: a dozen artists taking over two stalls in the Mercado Medell\u00edn in Roma to sell artworks made with materials found in the market itself.Mr. Orozco hung a toy ball inside a plastic bag wrapped with the thin skin of an agave plant. Monica Manzutto, his dealer, was stunned by the response. \u201cA gallerist came to the market first thing at 8 a.m and said: I want all of the Orozcos,\u201d she said. \u201cVery fast we were faced with the problem of speculation, and we decided then: No, you can only have one. We all learned from that one.\u201dNow that Mr. Orozco\u2019s paintings regularly sell for six figures, the desire to prevent flipping has grown, prompting the $15,000 starting price for the Oxxo artworks and his decision to \u201cdiscontinue\u201d many lines of products at a key point in the project.\u201cI want to prevent speculation at both ends: from big collectors abusing their timing and power so they get first choice and buy everything cheap, and also from someone who comes in to buy something at a low price and put it on eBay,\u201d he said.He has drafted other rules, including an injunction against insider trading or tipping off collectors to possible promotions. After 30 days, no more sales are allowed.And to safeguard against forgery, one more rule: Buyers will get a receipt that doubles as a certificate of authenticity. On top is a new logo, something of an inside joke. It says \u201cOROXXO.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They may get tax credits for child care costs, their companies may be allowed to repatriate foreign profits, and their coming income tax cuts might fund a luxury vacation or two.\u201cSilicon Valley is unlikely, as a phenomenon \u2014 it is not the default state of the world,\u201d said John Collison, an immigrant from Ireland who is a co-founder of Stripe, a six-year-old payments start-up based in San Francisco.One important reason Silicon Valley can exist at all, he said, is that it is welcoming to people from far outside its borders. \u201cI go all across the world, and every other place is asking, \u2018How do we replicate Silicon Valley where we are \u2014 in London, in Paris, in Singapore, in Australia?\u2019\u201dThe reason those places have so far failed to create their own indomitable tech hubs is that everyone there wants to come here.\u201cThe U.S. is sucking up all the talent from all across the world,\u201d Mr. Collison said. \u201cLook at all the leading technology companies globally, and look at how overrepresented the United States is. That\u2019s not a normal state of affairs. That\u2019s because we have managed to create this engine where the best and the brightest from around the world are coming to Silicon Valley.\u201dBut, Mr. Collison added, \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of fragile.\u201d Under Mr. Trump, the immigrant-friendly dynamic could change \u2014 and it could bring about the ruin of American tech.And yet even a casual trip through most histories of the technology industry reveals an outsize role played by immigrants.Collectively, these companies, which include householdish names like Uber, Tesla and Palantir, had created thousands of jobs and added billions of dollars to the American economy. Their founders came from all over the world \u2014 India, Britain, Canada, Israel and China, among lots and lots of other points around the globe.That should come as no surprise if you are familiar with the origins of the most iconic companies of the last few decades. One of Google\u2019s founders is an immigrant from Russia, and its current chief executive is an immigrant from India. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive is also from India. EBay and Yahoo were started by immigrants. Facebook\u2019s largest subsidiaries, Instagram and WhatsApp, were both co-founded by immigrants. Apple was started by a child of immigrants.But if that criticism rings true in some parts of the tech industry, it misses the picture among Silicon Valley\u2019s top companies. One common misperception of Silicon Valley is that it operates like a factory; in that view, tech companies can hire just about anyone from anywhere in the world to fill a particular role.But today\u2019s most ambitious tech companies are not like factories. They\u2019re more like athletic teams. They\u2019re looking for the LeBrons and Bradys \u2014 the best people in the world to come up with some brand-new, never-before-seen widget, to completely reimagine what widgets should do in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s not about adding tens or hundreds of thousands of people into manufacturing plants,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the co-founder and chief executive of the cloud-storage company Box. \u201cIt\u2019s about the couple ideas that are going to be invented that are going to change everything.\u201dIf you look at some of the most consequential ideas in tech, you find an unusual number that were developed by immigrants. For instance, Google\u2019s entire advertising business \u2014 that is, the basis for the vast majority of its revenues and profits, the engine that allows it to hire thousands of people in the United States \u2014 was created by three immigrants: Salar Kamangar and Omid Kordestani, who came to the United States from Iran, and Eric Veach, from Canada.But it\u2019s not just a numbers thing. Another reason immigrants do so well in tech is that people from outside bring new perspectives that lead to new ideas.Mike Krieger, an immigrant from Brazil who is a co-founder of Instagram, the photo-based social network app, said one reason it found instant, international success was that he purposely eliminated most text from the app. He knew from growing up in Brazil that English would hinder adoption in most parts of the world.\u201cEvery step of the way while we were creating it,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were thinking, can you create something with international appeal?\u201dMr. Collison, of Stripe, said he could not imagine creating a company without immigrants. \u201cIn the early stages of a start-up you usually have a very specific set of things you need to do, and there\u2019s a very short list of people who are able to do them,\u201d he said.In its early years, Stripe needed engineers and executives to build its system for moving money around the world; it needed to create a novel machine-learning system to detect fraud; and it had to convince regulators and other businesses that it was safe and legal to process payments through Stripe. The people it found for all these roles happened to be immigrants.\u201cThe fact that we can do that in Silicon Valley \u2014 the fact that the talent is here or that we can bring the talent here, that\u2019s what makes the whole thing work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Future of Not Working", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "The Future of WorkAs automation reduces the need for human labor, some Silicon Valley executives think a universal income will be the answer \u2014 and the beta test is happening in Kenya.Supported byIn October, I visited Kennedy Aswan Abagi, the village chief, at his small red-earth home, decorated with posters celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden and the lives of African heroes, including JaKogelo, or \u201cthe man from Kogelo,\u201d as locals refer to former President Barack Obama. Kogelo, where Obama\u2019s father was born, is just 20 miles from the village, which lies close to the banks of Lake Victoria. Abagi told me about the day his town\u2019s fate changed. It happened during the summer, when field officers from an American nonprofit called GiveDirectly paid a visit, making an unbelievable promise: They wanted to give everyone money, no strings attached. \u201cI asked, \u2018Why this village?\u2019\u2009\u201d Abagi recalled, but he never got a clear answer, or one that made much sense to him.The villagers had seen Western aid groups come through before, sure, but nearly all of them brought stuff, not money. And because many of these organizations were religious, their gifts came with moral impositions; I was told that one declined to help a young mother whose child was born out of wedlock, for example. With little sense of who would get what and how and from whom and why, rumors blossomed. One villager heard that GiveDirectly would kidnap children. Some thought that the organization was aligned with the Illuminati, or that it would blight the village with giant snakes, or that it performed blood magic. Others heard that the money was coming from Obama himself.But the confusion faded that unseasonably cool morning in October, when a GiveDirectly team returned to explain themselves during a town meeting. Nearly all of the village\u2019s 220 people crowded into a blue-and-white tent placed near the school building, watching nervously as 13 strangers, a few of them white, sat on plastic chairs opposite them. Lydia Tala, a Kenyan GiveDirectly staff member, got up to address the group in Dholuo. She spoke at a deliberate pace, awaiting a hum and a nod from the crowd before she moved on: These visitors are from GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a nongovernmental organization that is not affiliated with any political party. GiveDirectly is based in the United States. GiveDirectly works with mobile phones. Each person must have his or her own mobile phone, and they must keep their PIN secret. Nobody must involve themselves in criminal activity or terrorism. This went on for nearly two hours. The children were growing restless.Finally, Tala passed the microphone to her colleague, Brian Ouma. \u201cPeople of the village,\u201d he said, \u201care you happy?\u201d\u201cWe are!\u201d they cried in unison.Then he laid out the particulars. \u201cEvery registered person will receive 2,280 shillings\u201d \u2014 about $22 \u2014 \u201ceach and every month. You hear me?\u201d The audience gasped and burst into wild applause. \u201cEvery person we register here will receive the money, I said \u2014 2,280 shillings! Every month. This money, you will get for the next 12 years. How many years?\u201d\u201cTwelve years!\u201dJust like that, with peals of ululation and children breaking into dance in front of the strangers, the whole village was lifted out of extreme poverty. (I have agreed to withhold its name out of concern for the villagers\u2019 safety.) The nonprofit is in the process of registering roughly 40 more villages with a total of 6,000 adult residents, giving those people a guaranteed, 12-year-long, poverty-ending income. An additional 80 villages, with 11,500 residents all together, will receive a two-year basic income. With this initiative, GiveDirectly \u2014 with an office in New York and funded in no small part by Silicon Valley \u2014 is starting the world\u2019s first true test of a universal basic income. The idea is perhaps most in vogue in chilly, left-leaning places, among them Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. But many economists think it might have the most promise in places with poorer populations, like India and sub-Saharan Africa.GiveDirectly wants to show the world that a basic income is a cheap, scalable way to aid the poorest people on the planet. \u201cWe have the resources to eliminate extreme poverty this year,\u201d Michael Faye, a founder of GiveDirectly, told me. But these resources are often misallocated or wasted. His nonprofit wants to upend incumbent charities, offering major donors a platform to push money to the world\u2019s neediest immediately and practically without cost.What happens in this village has the potential to transform foreign-aid institutions, but its effects might also be felt closer to home. A growing crowd, including many of GiveDirectly\u2019s backers in Silicon Valley, are looking at this pilot project not just as a means of charity but also as the groundwork for an argument that a universal basic income might be right for you, me and everyone else around the world too.Silicon Valley has recently become obsessed with basic income for reasons simultaneously generous and self-interested, as a palliative for the societal turbulence its inventions might unleash. Many technologists believe we are living at the precipice of an artificial-intelligence revolution that could vault humanity into a postwork future. In the past few years, artificially intelligent systems have become proficient at a startling number of tasks, from reading cancer scans to piloting a car to summarizing a sports game to translating prose. Any job that can be broken down into discrete, repeatable tasks \u2014 financial analytics, marketing, legal work \u2014 could be automated out of existence.In this vision of the future, our economy could turn into a funhouse-mirror version of itself: extreme income and wealth inequality, rising poverty, mass unemployment, a shrinking prime-age labor force. It would be more George Saunders than George Jetson. But what does this all have to do with a small village in Kenya?A universal basic income has thus far lacked what tech folks might call a proof of concept. There have been a handful of experiments, including ones in Canada, India and Namibia. Finland is sending money to unemployed people, and the Dutch city Utrecht is doing a trial run, too. But no experiment has been truly complete, studying what happens when you give a whole community money for an extended period of time \u2014 when nobody has to worry where his or her next meal is coming from or fear the loss of a job or the birth of a child.And so, the tech industry is getting behind GiveDirectly and other organizations testing the idea out. Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder and briefly the owner of The New Republic, has started a $10 million, two-year initiative to explore the viability of a basic income. (He has also been a major donor to GiveDirectly.) The research wing of Sam Altman\u2019s start-up incubator, Y Combinator, is planning to pass out money to 1,000 families in California and another yet-to-be-determined state. Then there is GiveDirectly itself, which has attracted $24 million in donations for its basic-income effort, including money from founders of Facebook, Instagram, eBay and a number of other Silicon Valley companies. Many donors I spoke with cited their interest in the project as purely philanthropic. But others saw it as a chance to learn more about a universal basic income, a way to prove that it could work and a chance to show people the human face of a hypothetical policy fix.In December, Altman, the 31-year-old president of Y Combinator, spoke at an anti-poverty event hosted by Stanford, the White House and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable institution the Facebook billionaire founded with his wife, Priscilla. Altman discussed the potential for basic income to alleviate poverty, but his speech veered back to the dark questions that hang over all this philanthropy: Is Silicon Valley about to put the world out of work? And if so, do technologists owe the world a solution?\u201cThere have been these moments where we have had these major technology revolutions \u2014 the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, for example \u2014 that have really changed the world in a big way,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the middle or at least on the cusp of another one.\u201dThe idea for the nonprofit came to Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus, who is now a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, when they were graduate students at Harvard. Both were studying development and doing fieldwork overseas, an experience that underlined an Economics 101 lesson: Cash was more valuable to its recipients than the in-kind gifts commonly distributed by aid groups, like food or bed nets or sports equipment. If you\u2019re hungry, you cannot eat a bed net. If your village is suffering from endemic diarrhea, soccer balls won\u2019t be worth much to you. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve been there, it\u2019s hard to imagine doing anything but cash,\u201d Faye told me. \u201cIt\u2019s so deeply uncomfortable to ask someone if they want cash or something else. They look at you like it\u2019s a trick question.\u201dBut at the time, distributing cash aid in a country with little to no banking infrastructure outside major cities would have required an extraordinary amount of manpower, not to mention introducing the risk of robbery and graft. But dirt-cheap mobile phones with pay-as-you-go minutes began flooding into sub-Saharan African markets in the 2000s. Enterprising Ghanaians, Kenyans and Nigerians started to use their minutes as a kind of currency. In 2007, Vodafone and the British Department for International Development together built a system, called M-Pesa, for Kenyans to transfer actual shillings from cellphone to cellphone. An estimated 96 percent of Kenyan households use the system today.Faye and Niehaus \u2014 along with their friends Rohit Wanchoo and Jeremy Shapiro, also graduate students \u2014 thought about setting up a website to raise cash in the United States and send it directly to poor Kenyans. But they never found a nonprofit that would distribute that cash abroad. They decided to do it themselves in 2008. \u201cBecause it was a start-up, and we started in grad school,\u201d Faye said, \u201cwe were open to the idea of it being wrong or failing.\u201dThe following year, Faye traveled to small Kenyan villages during the summer break, offering cash to whoever seemed poor and would take it. (The money, about $5,000, came out of the foursome\u2019s own pockets.) That, surprisingly, worked well enough to give them the confidence to start a threadbare randomized control trial the year they graduated. It found that the recipients, who received an average of $500, saw excellent outcomes: Their children were 42 percent less likely to go a whole day without eating. Domestic-violence rates dropped, and mental health improved.In time, the nonprofit attracted the attention of Silicon Valley and its deep-pocketed young philanthropists. Two Facebook founders gave six-figure donations. Then, in the spring of 2012, Faye went to a friend\u2019s brunch in Brooklyn and met someone working for Google.org, the tech giant\u2019s giving arm. She liked the sound of GiveDirectly and arranged for Faye and Niehaus to give a presentation at Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company ended up contributing $2.4 million.At first, GiveDirectly handed out large lump sums, generally $1,000 spread into three payments over the course of the year. The nonprofit\u2019s field officers would locate low-income villages in Kenya, then find the poorest families in each individual village using a simple asset test (whether a family had a thatched roof or not). The field officers would introduce themselves to the town elders, explain their purpose and return to provide mobile phones and training to recipient families. Then GiveDirectly would push a button and send the money out.The residents of this village had received money in 2013, and it was visibly better off than the basic-income pilot village. Its clearings were filled with mango plantings, its cows sturdy. A small lake on the outskirts had been lined with nets for catching fish. \u201cCould you imagine sitting in an office in London or New York trying to figure out what this village needs?\u201d Bassin said as he admired a well-fed cow tied up by the lakeside. \u201cIt would just be impossible.\u201dPerhaps, but delivering money by M-Pesa has some downsides, too. We visited an older woman named Anjelina Akoth Ngalo, her joints painful and swollen with advanced malaria. Sitting in her thatched-roof hut, she told us that she had received only one payment, not the three that she was promised. She had given her phone to a woman in a nearby village who transferred the money out of it. Ngalo visited the village elder to try to get her money back, but nothing had come of it. She was now destitute, living on about $5 a week. She had not eaten since the day before, and she had run out of malaria medication. (Bassin said that less than 1 percent of recipients experience theft, crime or conflict.)By giving money to some but not all, the organization had unwittingly strained the social fabric of some of these tight-knit tribal communities. One man we visited in a separate village nearby, Nicolus Owuor Otin, had acted as a liaison between the community and the GiveDirectly staff, showing them where different families\u2019 houses were, for instance. For that reason, he said, the other villagers thought he was determining who would get what and threatened to burn his house down.Still, nearly all the recipients described the money as transformative. Fredrick Omondi Auma \u2014 a Burning Spear devotee wearing a Rasta-style hat and bell bottoms when we visited \u2014 had been impoverished, drinking too much, abandoned by his wife and living in a mud hut when GiveDirectly knocked on his door. He used his money to buy a motorbike to give taxi rides. He also started a small business, selling soap, salt and paraffin in a local town center; he bought two cows, one of which had given birth; and he opened a barbershop in the coastal city Mombasa. His income had gone from 600 shillings a week to 2,500 shillings \u2014 roughly $25, a princely sum for the area. His wife had returned. He had even stopped drinking as much. \u201cI used to go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I\u2019d wake up in the bar with 100 shillings,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I wake up at home with 900.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I would be living in an iron-sheet house,\u201d he said, referring to his roof. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d be wearing nice shoes. I didn\u2019t imagine I would have a business, and earnings from it. I didn\u2019t imagine I would be a man who owns cattle.\u201dAll across the villages of western Kenya, it was clear to me just how much aid money was wasted on unnecessary stuff. The villagers had too many jerrycans and water tanks, because a nongovernmental organization kept bringing them. There was a thriving trade in Toms canvas slip-ons: People received them free from NGO workers and then turned around and sold them in the market centers. And none of the aid groups that had visited the villages managed to help the very poorest families.In the pilot-project village, for example, Faye and I paid a visit to a woman named Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo, who lives in a mud hut on the edge of town with her husband, Jack, a laborer, and her two small children. The most expensive thing she ever bought, she told me, was a chicken for 500 shillings, or about $5. Her family was persistently hungry. She knew of three nonprofit groups that had helped the village before GiveDirectly. One aided families with school fees, but it chose not to help her children. \u201cI do not want to talk about it,\u201d she said.What is worse, Faye told me, walking away from Odhiambo\u2019s hut, was that most nonprofit projects in the region were never subject to anything like an impact assessment, either. There is no way to know how well they are working, or whether that money would be better spent on something else. \u201cThe question should always be: Would we be better off just giving this money away as cash?\u201d Faye said. \u201cThere usually is not a way to answer that question.\u201dA vast majority of aid \u2014 94 percent \u2014 is noncash. Donor resistance is one reason for this; it is not easy to persuade American oligarchs, British inheritors and Japanese industrialists to fork over their money to the extremely poor to use as they see fit. \u201cThere\u2019s the usual worries about welfare dependency, the whole \u2018Give a man a fish\u2019 thing,\u201d said Amanda Glassman, a public health and development expert at the Center for Global Development. \u201cIt\u2019s so powerful. It\u2019s really a basic psychological feature of the landscape. You\u2019ll start drinking. You\u2019ll start lying around at home because you\u2019re getting paid.\u201dCash also seems harder to market. American taxpayers might be perfectly happy to fund education for young women in poor countries or vaccinations for schoolchildren. But they might balk at the idea of showering money on poor, unstable countries. \u201cThe visual of putting a pill in a kid\u2019s mouth is so much more attractive to people,\u201d Glassman said.Institutional inertia is another factor. \u201cThere are a lot of good people working in the system,\u201d Niehaus said. \u201cAnd there are a lot of organizations pushing to do cash transfers. But the way they are structured and incentivized from the top down \u2014 they aren\u2019t structured to do it. They have a specific mandate, like health. Cash transfers give choice of what goal to pursue to the recipients.\u201dMoreover, cash might force aid workers and nongovernmental organizations to confront the fact that they could be doing better by doing things differently \u2014 often by doing less. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to muster evidence that you should be giving cash instead of fertilizer,\u201d said Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development. \u201cThe harder argument is: You should shut down your U.S.A.I.D. program, which is bigger than the education budget of Liberia, and give the money to Liberians. That\u2019s the radical critique.\u201d Faye put it more bluntly, if half-jokingly: If cash transfers flourished, \u201cthe whole aid industry would have to fire itself.\u201dThere is something to that. One estimate, generated by Laurence Chandy and Brina Seidel of the Brookings Institution, recently calculated that the global poverty gap \u2014 meaning how much it would take to get everyone above the poverty line \u2014 was just $66 billion. That is roughly what Americans spend on lottery tickets every year, and it is about half of what the world spends on foreign aid.But here, many villagers were concerned primarily with procuring the sustenance and basic comforts that their penury had denied them. Odhiambo, the woman who had not been offered aid by the school group, planned to buy corrugated iron sheets for her roof; she considered possibly paying off her dowry. Another villager, Pamela Aooko Odero, ran a household that had been suffering from hunger, with all eight of them living on just 500 to 1,000 shillings a week. She took her money as soon as she got it and went to buy food.Many more made plans that were entrepreneurial. Two widowed sister-wives, Margaret Aloma Abagi and Mary Abonyo Abagi, told me they planned to pool their funds together to start a small bank with some friends. Charles Omari Ager, a houseboy for the sister-wives, had his phone turned off and wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket when the first text came in. He was driving the widows\u2019 goats and cattle from one dried-out, bramble-filled meadow to another when he happened upon an aid worker, who prompted him to pull out his phone, turn it on and wait. The text was there. The money was there. \u201cI\u2019m happy! I\u2019m happy! I\u2019m happy!\u201d he said. He bought himself a goat that day.When the nets were done, he told me, he would rent a boat and hire a day laborer to work with him. He anticipated that his income, after costs, might reach as much as 2,000 shillings on a good day. I asked him why he hadn\u2019t saved money for nets beforehand.He shrugged, smiled and said, \u201cI could not.\u201dAnnie Lowrey is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a former economic-policy reporter for The Times.

{"Headline": "Who Are the Richest of the Rich?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isn\u2019t a lot of money in 1997.Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, \u201cO.K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion.\u201dTwenty years after the movie \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d was released, billions of dollars aren\u2019t what they used to be, either.Bill Gates alone is just $10 billion shy of Dr. Evil\u2019s ransom demand, according to a list of the world\u2019s top 10 billionaires compiled by Wealth-X, a financial research firm. Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, tops the list at $89.3 billion, followed by his friend Warren Buffett at $73.5 billion.The top 10 \u2014 nine from the United States, one from Spain \u2014 have a combined net worth of $582 billion. While their wealth would certainly be enough to save the world from Dr. Evil, what they do with it in real life is the subject of great interest and debate.That is true now more than ever. Issues around money \u2014 like wealth inequality and talk of tax cuts for the rich \u2014 are among the hottest topics of the day. And the richest president in history is sitting in the Oval Office, with billionaires sprinkled throughout his cabinet.To some, today\u2019s billionaires are like Dr. Evil: selfish, rapacious and bent on world domination. To others, billionaires are worthy of respect for having put their names and fortunes behind an array of philanthropic endeavors, many aimed at improving the lives of people at the very base of the wealth pyramid.There were 2,473 billionaires in the world, as of Wealth-X\u2019s last count through 2015. That was a 6.4 percent increase in billionaires from the year before.But who these billionaires are and what they\u2019re like is more difficult to discern. Many may seem as ordinary as the guy sitting next to you on the train \u2014 or in Michael Bloomberg\u2019s case, standing beside you on the subway, when he was mayor of New York. (Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on Wealth-X\u2019s list.)There are certainly billionaires who want to save the world, like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bloomberg, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. Others in the top 10 are also philanthropic, but they are still focusing on their day jobs, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Alphabet (the parent of Google) \u2014 Nos. 4, 5 and 10.Yet many of the billionaires beyond the top 10 or 20 have a much lower profile. Who outside of finance or hockey knew of Vincent Viola, a former oil trader and current owner of the Florida Panthers, before President Trump nominated him to be secretary of the Army? Now that he has withdrawn, he can return to relative anonymity.For that matter, Wilbur L. Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, is the wealthiest of the president\u2019s billionaire cabinet picks. He would pop up in the headlines every few years for a deal he was making but then return to what could be called the quiet opulence of the billionaire class.\u201cThey\u2019re different in how they can invest their assets and what their portfolio may look like,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said. \u201cIn many ways, they face different risks, both personal risks and cyber risks, than the average individual does. They often think about structuring decisions differently from a succession-planning standpoint as well as the structure they create around themselves and their family.\u201dYet for most people, billionaires are just wealthy beyond belief. And these days, they are also much wealthier (and getting even more so) than the broader ultra-high-net-worth population.That group is defined as anyone with more than $30 million. In 2015, there were 212,615 of them. On the lower end, the 155,050 people worth between $30 million and $99 million had a combined $8.4 trillion. At the top, the world\u2019s 2,473 billionaires were worth $7.68 trillion.\u201cThere is growing inequality around the world, but there is also inequality among the ultrawealthy,\u201d said Maya Imberg, director of custom research at Wealth-X.Billionaires also matter because of the outsize influence they have, or believe they can have, on policy and public life. They can give millions to a political campaign, as Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, did with Mr. Trump, or as George Soros, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has done with liberal causes.But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group. How they amassed their billions, and how that pile is growing, tells a lot about the economy today.Just as the best teacher in the country is going to earn less money than a mediocre investment banker, the industries in which future billionaires begin their careers determine the magnitude of their wealth and how quickly it is going to grow.Six of the top 10 billionaires made their money in technology. But in Wealth-X\u2019s research, technology ranks sixth overall for the number of billionaires on the list, with 114 around the world.Finance has created the most billionaires, with 377, or 15 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires. It is followed by industrial conglomerates, with 317, or 13 percent.After that, the concentration in particular industries drops. Real estate is third with 141. The group of people who identify their industry as nonprofits (meaning they made their money some other way or inherited it) is fourth, with 122. Manufacturing, in fifth place, has 120.\u201cGlobalization has been a big trend,\u201d said Benjamin Kinnard, a research analyst at Wealth-X. \u201cThe market is now seven billion people, not just the size of your domestic country.\u201dHe added that finance had a bigger lead in first place several years ago, but it has been losing ground as industries like technology boom.A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other people\u2019s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified.The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance.And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts).While the number of billionaires in China is rising at a fast clip, the pace of growth in billionaires worldwide is slowing. Wealth-X said the number will be 3,250 by 2020, down 16 percent from an earlier prediction of 3,873. This is because economic growth is expected to slow around the world.Across the billionaire spectrum, the biggest proportion of billionaires\u2019 wealth \u2014 about half \u2014 is in the business that created the wealth in the first place, according to Wealth-X\u2019s research. After that, they have about a quarter of their money in public securities and a little less than a quarter in cash. Just 4 percent is in real estate and luxury assets, the research found.There are common strains to how they cross the billionaire line, regardless of industry: 57 percent are self-made, according to Wealth-X, and another 31 percent received an inheritance and grew it into billions.\u201cTiming has a lot to do with it,\u201d said John Mathews, head of private wealth management and the ultra-high-net-worth group at UBS. \u201cIf we looked back 100 years, it would have been a really great time to be in steel, railroad or infrastructure businesses. Today, it\u2019s a good time to be in technology and finance.\u201dBut there is a difference from the bottom of the billionaire ladder to the top: Most are on that first rung.Over half of all billionaires are worth between $1 billion and $2 billion. Go up to $5 billion and there are 2,101.And not all billionaires are household names.Ma Jianrong, executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group Holdings, which is the leading textile company in China and manufactures clothing for Nike, Adidas, Puma and Uniqlo, is worth $4.3 billion.Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, built his wealth through mining in South Africa after starting his career as a lawyer in the United States. He is now worth $2.1 billion.Kevin Systrom, chief executive of Instagram, is surely well known in Silicon Valley \u2014 and among students at Stanford University (his alma mater) who want to emulate his route to a net worth of $1.2 billion by age 33. But he is not as recognizable as Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook.But being a billionaire, as opposed to a very wealthy millionaire, can make a huge difference in the loss of privacy for a family. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to be anonymous,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said.And being known as billionaires opens them up to risks, she said, like cybersecurity breaches and attacks on their families.How single-digit billionaires add additional billions isn\u2019t always up to them.One way to become even wealthier is to have picked the right global industry in which to make your billions and hang on to your stake in your company as it booms \u2014 and avoids busts. Right now, the technology and finance industries are leading the growth. Another way is to make your money in the right region, which is Asia.Then, of course, there are the investment opportunities that only get presented to the wealthiest people, and that only they have the resources to take a chance on. \u201cThey can diversify their holdings to protect themselves,\u201d Mr. Kinnard said.And the big investments that are needed in private equity deals, for example, are a smaller portion of overall wealth for billionaires than for someone with, say, $100 million.\u201cThe common thread with billionaires is the incredibly focused drive these people have in whatever business they go into,\u201d Mr. Mathews said. \u201cIt\u2019s dogged determination. You can say everyone is like that, but with billionaires everything else gets blocked out. You see it today with tech the way you saw it with steel barons 100 years ago.\u201dYet getting across the billionaire line does not mean a person will always be there.\u201cOnce a billionaire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stay a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Mathews of UBS said. \u201cLast year alone there were 41 new billionaires created in the United States, but 36 also dropped out of billionaire status in the U.S. Our billionaire population is growing but only by a net of five.\u201dIn the United States, Mr. Mathews said, most people fall off the billionaire list because they sell the company that created their wealth. \u201cWhen you sell it, there are tax issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are estate-planning issues.\u201dThe latter results in chunks of money being given to heirs to get it out of the wealth creator\u2019s estate.Selling family firms happens less often in Europe and Asia. People end up holding on to them and creating family holding companies to continue to operate that original business and expand into others.Of course, people who sell their $1 billion company and end up with $500 million after taxes \u2014 or whose wealth tops out at $800 million \u2014 aren\u2019t scraping by. But being a billionaire gives you entry into an exclusive club that being a millionaire does not. After all, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s wealth from his career at Exxon Mobil looks positively modest. He\u2019s worth just a few hundred million.What is expected of people who have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes? It depends on whom you ask.\u201cIt is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when one in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day,\u201d Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam, said in a statement. \u201cInequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty. It is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.\u201dYet the anger against the superrich has abated since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Protesters seem to be more concerned with the actions of Mr. Trump (who is likely a billionaire, although he has provided little proof of his real wealth) than with his cabinet of plutocrats.Philanthropy has become important to many billionaires, and not just through the Giving Pledge, Mr. Buffett\u2019s compact to get the wealthiest to give away at least half of their fortunes. Nor is it confined to the United States, with its tradition of charitable giving.\u201cWhen I explained to him that New York City\u2019s annual school budget was $22 billion a year,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, \u201cthat was the last time we ever heard from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He befriended tree cutters around his home and worked with sawyers to learn how to use sawing equipment.Within a few months, Mr. Rising was milling his own lumber, and several years later began selling custom furniture on eBay. Now, his furniture-making company creates tables, chairs, walls, cabinets, coasters and anything else a customer wants from dead trees, demolished water towers and razed 19th-century tenements.Mr. Rising lets the wood dictate the design, embracing the natural caramel and oak colors along with expected distress to polish off his items, enhancing some with welded metals.While he now has a staff of four, his business began as a one-man show.\u201cMount Vernon is a predominantly black neighborhood, and with black culture, sometimes the strangest things earn you a nickname, so the people became familiar with me and started calling me \u2018the black lumberjack,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rising said.\u201cI was kind of in shock when it first happened,\u201d Mr. Rising said.Still, he said he was looking at this rebuilding stage as just another challenge.Two of those customers, Sam Ballantyne, 27, and Hannah Johnson, 25, showed up at the demolished warehouse in mid-February expecting to work with a slab from an oak tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy, which would become a dining table in Mr. Ballantyne\u2019s Brooklyn apartment.Mr. Rising picked up the couple in his 1992 Chevrolet 16-passenger sport van, which now has seats only for the driver and one passenger, usually whoever is helping with delivery. Mr. Ballantyne rode on a tire in the back.\u201cWe drove out into this yard and they had a shipping container rigged up and open so the light from outside was coming in, and it was a very rough setup,\u201d Mr. Ballantyne said. \u201cRobert is really friendly, and you could tell he was improvising and wanted it to work out under the circumstances. It\u2019s incredible that what could be a business-ending experience, having your warehouse burned down, led to a great experience for us.\u201dOther customers are offering help.\u201cUnless he\u2019s got someplace I don\u2019t know about, what\u2019s missing is that he should have a showroom,\u201d Mr. Bianco said. \u201cRobert\u2019s a special guy with the way he looks at his work as a recycler and a woodworker, but he\u2019s also got a very high sense of design and aesthetic appreciation.\u201dMr. Bianco is hoping to partner with NYCitySlab and put tables and furniture in an informal showroom in the barn.For Mr. Rising now, it\u2019s a waiting game. Though he has secured a new shop location in Yonkers, he can\u2019t get to his potentially ruined equipment until the Fire Department has concluded its investigation.\u201cI have to talk about all this with a smile on my face,\u201d Mr. Rising said. \u201cIf I was to dwell and get into the bad part of it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to function. It\u2019s devastating. So, I look at the silver lining.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Treadmills Add to Evidence in Arrest for Dog Fighting", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA woman was arrested on charges of animal cruelty after officials found all the signs that her pit bulls had been used for dog fighting, according to prosecutors in Queens. Huddled in cages inside a garage in Far Rockaway, Queens, the four dogs had torn ears, bruises, broken teeth, puncture wounds and cuts.But it wasn\u2019t just the battered dogs that detectives said confirmed their suspicions. Investigators also found a stockpile of training equipment, like a bloodied \u201cbreak stick,\u201d a tool commonly used to separate a dog\u2019s clenched jaws, as well as a device known as a slat mill, a dog-powered treadmill often used to make fighting animals firm and fleet.Yet animal cruelty experts and the police say that these machines are the dog fighting world\u2019s open secret and are found and used as evidence in most dog fighting stings nationwide.Some pet owners, manufacturers and veterinarians say that the devices can be a healthy way to strengthen dogs and that they can help produce prize dogs for the somewhat obscure world of canine strength competitions. The machines can be used by any dog, their defenders say, but the avalanche of online instructional videos show overwhelmingly that it is pit bulls \u2014 the chief breed used in dog fighting \u2014 doing the running.At the offices of the Humane Society of the United States in Gaithersburg, Md., Chris Schindler, the director for animal cruelty and fighting prevention, keeps as a teaching tool a slat mill recovered during a sting operation. Owning a running machine or making one hardly means that a person is involved in dog fighting \u2014 people living in apartments or with limited mobility might find them a practical way to exercise energetic dogs.Dr. Richard Goldstein, the chief medical officer of the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, said the center used motorized treadmills to rehabilitate patients, adding that the machines must be monitored at all times by trained workers. Nonmotorized treadmills can be a cheaper and safer alternative for pet owners, he said, adding that sled dogs, for example, are often trained on treadmills before races so they can run indoors.\u201cWe understand that there is obviously abuse of the techniques to train dogs to strengthen their endurance,\u201d Dr. Goldstein said, \u201cbut it is a legitimate tool for training dogs.\u201dSlat mills are a preferred piece of equipment for dog fighters, said a man who trained and fought pit bulls across the United States for over 20 years, before quitting in 2010 and becoming an informant for animal rights groups and law enforcement.\u201cYou can be very discreet with your illegal activity. You can portray it as saying that it\u2019s just exercise equipment,\u201d said the man, who declined to be named because he is an informant. \u201cThe reality is, it\u2019s all illegal and it is made to make these dogs fighting machines.\u201dExperts say there is a strong correlation between fighting and the running tracks commonly sold on the web. \u201cA lot of things can be inhumane in the wrong hands,\u201d Mr. Schindler said.Dog fighting is illegal nationwide, and in 20 states, including New York, possession of slat mills is, too, if there is proof of intent to use them for dog fighting purposes.\u201cYou\u2019re not talking just about the mill itself, you\u2019re talking about the totality of the evidence seized, that show this person is involved in dog fighting, which is inherently cruel,\u201d Mr. Schindler said.\u201cIt\u2019s relatively compact, you can keep it in your basement, no one sees you involved in the training, and it can be secretive,\u201d Dr. Lockwood said. \u201cThat is why it is one of the preferred pieces of conditioning equipment.\u201dSlat mills were discovered on the property of Michael Vick, a former professional football player who was convicted in 2007 of running a dog fighting ring on his Virginia estate.When people call to order mills, however, he has learned to listen for certain buzzwords and unusual questions to try to keep them from falling into the wrong hands. They may mention \u201ca keep,\u201d or ask how long a dog can run until exhaustion.\u201cI end the conversation abruptly,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt is for my own mental and emotional well-being.\u201dThe woman who has been charged with animal cruelty by Queens prosecutors, Cherise Mickens, 27, had rented a garage in which her dogs were found starving, stacked in metal crates, alongside a slat mill. She faces up to four years in prison if convicted. A lawyer for Ms. Mickens did not respond to a request for comment.Advocacy groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals condemned the discovery and stressed that laws around the running machines should be strengthened.The whole slat mill industry is problematic, the dog fighting informant said.Manufacturers \u201ccan\u2019t differentiate between if I\u2019m a dog fighter or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be banned in every state and every country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
