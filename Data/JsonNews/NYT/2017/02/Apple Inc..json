{"Headline": "Warren Buffett, in Annual Letter, Offers Hymn to U.S. Economy", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWarren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, on Saturday lauded the \u201cmiraculous\u201d qualities of the United States economy in highlighting another stellar year for his company, Berkshire Hathaway.Mr. Buffett, whose record of beating the stock market over the past 50 years is unparalleled, is known for being persistently optimistic about the prospects of the American economy.He was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton during last year\u2019s presidential campaign and he did not mention President Trump in his letter. But his celebration of the American economy\u2019s ability to deliver growth stands in stark contrast to President Trump\u2019s darker descriptions of the country\u2019s economic prospects.That Mr. Buffett went out of his way to give credit to a \u201ctide of talented and ambitious immigrants\u201d was also worthy of note in light of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigrants.Last year was another outstanding one for the man known widely as the Oracle of Omaha. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stock price was up 23 percent in 2016, about double the return on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Berkshire\u2019s operating companies, which include the insurance firm Geico, the railroad company BNSF and numerous others, also performed well in an improving economy, with operating earnings increasing to $17.5 billion in 2016 from $17.3 billion in 2015.Mr. Buffett also revealed in his letter that a recent bet on Apple had paid quick dividends. He owns a 1.1 percent stake in the company that he purchased at a total cost of $6.7 billion. His 61 million shares are now worth over $8 billion.Over the years, Mr. Buffett has had a complicated relationship with Wall Street. He has been a withering critic of the culture of high pay, group think and excessive fees yet he has also swooped in to buy big stakes in investment firms when they hit rough times.Underscoring his long-held thesis that, over time, highly paid hedge-fund hotshots lose out to a cheap index fund, Mr. Buffett presented the latest results of a bet he made nine years ago. Since then, a standard S & P index fund overseen by Vanguard is up 85 percent, easily outpacing the hedge funds\u2019 return of 22 percent. Annually, the gap is just as wide: 7 percent for the index fund and 2.2 percent for the hedge funds.As usual, Mr. Buffett did not mince words in expressing his astonishment as to how elite investment professionals could register such mediocre returns while raking in steep fees.\u201cI\u2019m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But the results for their investors were dismal \u2014 really dismal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the funds and funds-of-funds involved \u2014 fees that were totally unwarranted by performance \u2014 were such that their managers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM Gives Watson a New Challenge: Your Tax Return", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its first steps toward commercialization, IBM\u2019s Watson took on grand, science-laden challenges like helping doctors diagnose cancer. But that is changing as IBM strives to build its artificial intelligence technology into a multibillion-dollar business.Today, companies including Geico, Staples and Macy\u2019s are adding the Watson technology to answer customer questions or to improve mobile apps that guide shoppers through stores.Now in its broadest deployment so far, Watson will be assisting H&R Block\u2019s 70,000 tax professionals this filing season at 10,000 branch offices across the country, where 11 million people file taxes.The H&R Block partnership with Watson, announced on Wednesday, is being presented to a wider audience with a 60-second television ad during the Super Bowl on Sunday.For IBM, the collaboration with H&R Block underlines its strategy in the emerging market for artificial intelligence technology. Watson will touch consumers, but through IBM\u2019s corporate clients.\u201cWatson will become a really smart, virtual assistant,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president of IBM\u2019s Watson business.The embedded-in-business formula is different from the path other technology companies are taking with digital assistants powered by artificial intelligence. Others are pursuing the broad consumer market directly with artificial intelligence software helpers like Siri from Apple, Cortana from Microsoft, Alexa from Amazon and Assistant from Google.In the corporate technology market, the major companies are racing to get on the artificial intelligence bandwagon, though they lack the early lead and powerful branding of Watson.Data-fueled artificial intelligence will be an ingredient in all kinds of software used in corporations, to streamline work, identify new customers, spot savings and guide product development, analysts say. By 2018, the research company IDC predicts that 75 percent of new business software will include artificial intelligence features.\u201cA.I. is becoming part of the mix, part of the infrastructure in consumer and business applications,\u201d said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.IBM is also banking on Watson as an engine of its corporate transformation. The company needs its new businesses like Watson, data analysis and cloud computing to more than make up for the erosion in its traditional hardware and software products.That has not happened yet. Two weeks ago, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarter of declining revenue.But there were encouraging signs in the last quarter of 2016.IBM executives noted that the company\u2019s newer businesses, including Watson, grew by 14 percent to represent 41 percent of total revenue. That was ahead of IBM\u2019s previous forecast that the 40 percent of revenue threshold would not be reached until 2018.But when Bill Cobb, chief executive of H&R Block, contacted IBM last summer, saying he wanted to use Watson to help \u201creinvent the retail experience for taxpayers,\u201d he heard what he called a candid assessment, not a sales pitch.\u201cThis is not magic,\u201d Mr. Cobb said the Watson team told him. \u201cYou have to teach Watson over time.\u201dWatson proved to be a quick learner. Its core skill is its ability to digest and classify vast amounts of text, using what is known as natural language processing. So, among other things, it was fed the 74,000 pages of the federal tax code and thousands of tax-related questions culled from H&R Block\u2019s data, accumulated over six decades of preparing tax returns.Then, H&R Block tax professionals were brought in to \u201ctrain\u201d Watson. They approved when Watson suggested a smart question for a particular tax filer and corrected it when a proposed question was off base. The tax professionals were not told they were working with Watson, just a software program.The technology was tested in about 100 H&R Block offices in January, and it will be available throughout the company\u2019s retail network next week. One goal, Mr. Cobb said, is to assist H&R Block\u2019s tax professionals and improve their chances of fairly increasing refunds and reducing tax liabilities for clients. Seventy-five percent of Americans who file taxes get money back. For H&R Block clients, the figure is about 85 percent, Mr. Cobb said.But Watson\u2019s other task was to make visiting H&R Block a more \u201cengaging and interactive\u201d experience, he said. Clients will be able to watch suggestions and questions on a separate screen, as the Watson-assisted tax professional works.Mr. Cobb said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with Watson\u2019s performance in the 100-office trial. But the test will come after this tax season, when H&R Block sees what percentage of customers return next year.The retention rate is crucial in the tax-preparation business. Sixty percent of the 140 million Americans who file taxes seek help instead of doing them themselves. Kartik Mehta, an analyst at Northcoast Research, estimates that H&R Block\u2019s retention rate is 75 percent. \u201cIf they can get that 75 percent up to 80 percent, it\u2019s a big deal for H&R Block,\u201d Mr. Mehta said.The Watson collaboration is a \u201clong-term partnership,\u201d Mr. Cobb said. Mr. Kenny of IBM described this tax season as \u201cphase one\u201d of the partnership.Over time, Watson\u2019s suggestions get better and better, more individually tailored to specific occupations, household finances and personal circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s crawl, walk, run learning,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cBut the pace of the Watson learning is so much faster than humans.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Automakers Step Up to Silicon Valley Challenge", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWOLFSBURG, Germany \u2014 One of the first things Ole Harms did after taking over Volkswagen\u2019s new ride-hailing start-up was leave town.Staid Wolfsburg, Volkswagen\u2019s home, was not the best place for the automaker to mount a defense against Silicon Valley challengers keen to upend the car industry, and he needed to move.\u201cNobody knows how the world is going to look\u201d in the coming years, said Mr. Harms, a bearded 41-year-old dressed in a gray cardigan over a crisply pressed white shirt. \u201cThe biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change.\u201dAt stake is the fate of the German economy, Europe\u2019s largest, at a time when the region is only beginning to emerge from a decade-long economic malaise. Germany, in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.Industry executives here often cite how Apple\u2019s iPhone quickly erased Nokia\u2019s once-dominant position in the mobile handset market, and they are determined not to let something similar happen to them.\u201cI am convinced that we are going to see more change in the next 10 or 15 years than we have seen in the last 100 years,\u201d Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the BMW management board, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe big question is always, Do we car manufacturers learn to become tech companies more quickly than a tech company learns to be an automotive player?\u201dBy contrast, Germany\u2019s automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach.To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon fiber body.Daimler also owns Car2Go, a short-term car rental service; Blacklane, an upmarket ride-hailing app; and MyTaxi, Europe\u2019s largest taxi-hailing service.Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, said the automaker\u2019s backing had allowed it to expand rapidly across Europe, where it has often teamed up with local taxi associations to combat the rise of Uber.\u201cThis is a game that requires deep pockets,\u201d Mr. Pinnington said.The German carmakers\u2019 digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals.\u201cThe future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together,\u201d said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm.Taken together, the carmakers\u2019 digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germany\u2019s vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States.But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology.The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germany\u2019s historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world.That is where Mr. Harms comes in.A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks.MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Mr. Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations.\u201cThe whole mobility market \u2014 transportation as a service \u2014 is just at the beginning,\u201d Mr. Harms said.Under Mr. M\u00fcller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least two million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service available in cities including New York and London.But for Mr. Harms, the carmakers\u2019 best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry \u2014 and other traditional sectors \u2014 to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful.\u201cA vehicle is extremely sensitive. You can\u2019t put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the ones who already know how to do it very well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Look Now, but the Great Unbundling Has Spun Into Reverse", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe internet promised to be the great unbundler. The evisceration of distribution costs would free consumers from paying for cable television channels they never watched, allowing them to bypass cable monopolies and pay only for the shows they wanted. No longer would anyone have to buy a $99-a-month triple-play package when all they wanted was the History Channel.Over the last two decades, consumers have felt liberated as traditional bundles unraveled \u2014 from music to media to retail.For instance, Craigslist and myriad other digital start-ups siphoned lucrative job and real estate listings from traditional newspaper bundles. Meanwhile, media firms held onto the economically challenged business of delivering news and entertainment.Proponents of the breakdown of the bundle economy most often cite cable television. Superficially, the evidence is compelling: In the last six years, pay TV penetration has declined from about 90 percent to 80 percent of homes \u2014 with more than two million homes cutting the cord in the last couple of years alone.But paradoxically, the same forces that allowed classified ads and news to be so easily separated also drastically increased the economic rationale for bundling across the board.Consumers merely have swapped one bundle for another (or often, several). There are more than 65 million subscribers to cheaper \u201cover the top\u201d packages provided by Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Sling TV and others (even excluding Amazon Prime Video). One does not always think of all of these as \u201cbundles\u201d because these services do not consistently categorize their content using the commonplace TV channel taxonomy. However, their aggregation of shows looks more and more like a traditional cable bundle.We are in the age of the great rebundling, when firms use packages of services as a way to increase their scale advantage and thus deepen the moat around their businesses.In music, the story is even starker than in television. At one time, consumers used to buy a collection of songs \u2014 on vinyl, cassette and then compact disc. It was possible to buy a single song or two in these formats, but the internet facilitated more and more people downloading individual tracks.Yet, today, there is an inexorable consumer shift to all-you-can-eat bundles of music. Already more than 60 million people pay for Spotify, Apple Music and others. These music bundles will increasingly be combined with other services as well to build competitive advantage. This newspaper currently includes Spotify with certain new subscriptions. And it is easy to see how Google and Apple will increasingly integrate music packages into their broader suite of services (as Amazon already has).Bundling has always worked well for products for which consumers have widely varying tastes and willingness to pay. The magic of bundle economics allows consumers to get more for less, while also maximizing revenue for the provider. Imagine that there are two hungry diners at a burger joint where the restaurant\u2019s marginal cost of food is zero-ish. One customer is willing to fork over $5 for a burger and $1 for fries. The other will shell out $5 for fries but only $1 for a burger. By selling a la carte, the restaurant maximizes revenue by pricing each item at $5. Both consumers leave hungry, and the business takes in $10. However, both diners would snap up a $6 bundle, allowing them to sate their appetites while shelling out $12 in total. Everyone is better off (perhaps not healthwise).In the digital environment, two additional forces are driving this tidal wave of digital bundling.First, the near-zero marginal cost of distribution makes all-you-can-eat packages compelling. Even heavy users of streaming services can potentially be profitable customers if the underlying economics of rights payments are well managed.The Federal Communications Commission appears to be relaxing its position on the bundling of data and services. The agency had been investigating the practice of \u201czero-rating,\u201d whereby a wireless carrier like T-Mobile allows its subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data cap. Recently, the F.C.C. dropped this investigation \u2014 believing that this kind of bundling is now commonplace in a competitive market. Plainly this is the thin edge of the wedge for net neutrality. Connectivity and cloud computing services will most likely start to include \u201cunrated\u201d services to differentiate themselves further from other commodity providers. In the short term, this shift will most likely be a boon for consumers. Time will tell whether this stifles long-range innovation \u2014 especially in bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming.Second, firms need to mitigate the high cost of attracting and retaining online consumers. Netflix can amortize the expense of acquiring and servicing a subscriber over the hundreds of dollars of revenue they will generate if they hang around for a couple of years. Selling individual shows for a few bucks a pop would be vastly more expensive in marketing, billing and service costs.Tying several services together (even when they are not all directly complementary) increases customer loyalty. Amazon Prime has more than 66 million subscribers. Just a few years ago, it was mostly a free-shipping service. Now, it includes an extensive library of free e-books, videos and music. The large base of Prime subscribers makes life hard for would-be Amazon competitors \u2014 who have to contend not just with Amazon\u2019s scale in any particular vertical but also the combined value of the eclectic products and services that Amazon bundles together. This value may also increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning help personalize these applications. Walmart may be four times larger than Amazon in retail, but Amazon\u2019s bundle magnifies the impact of its size, reducing its scale disadvantage.For insurgents, this trend complicates the already formidable challenge of competing with the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple \u2014 all of which have been adept at weaving various interconnected services together to magnify their scale advantage.Technology investors are obsessed with network effects. These help make firms like Facebook and eBay so valuable \u2014 because additional users increase utility for everyone, making it hard for upstarts to compete. But investors often forget that network effects are just a subset of scale advantages. Superior scale is what protects most businesses from competition. It would be hard to start a business to take on Coca-Cola because of its size advantage \u2014 especially in local bottling, distribution and marketing.During the road show for the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape, its chief executive, Jim Barksdale, famously commented that there are \u201conly two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.\u201d For many firms, the bundle is not a decaying symbol of legacy distribution. Rather, it is the new network effect: a critical strategy to amplify scale in the hope of building or deepening a moat to protect against foes everywhere.Jeremy G.

All of them were put on a low-calorie diet, had group counseling sessions and were advised to increase their physical activity. Six months into the intervention, all were given telephone counseling sessions, text-message prompts and study materials online.At that time, though, half were also given wearable tech devices that monitored their activity and connected to a website to help provide feedback. All participants were followed for 18 more months.At the end of the two years, which is pretty long for a weight loss study, those without access to the wearable technology lost an average of 13 pounds. Those with the wearable tech lost an average of 7.7 pounds.It\u2019s hard for many to accept, so I\u2019m going to state the results again: Those people who used the wearable tech for 18 months lost significantly less weight than those who didn\u2019t.You may rightfully point out that the primary reason to wear the devices isn\u2019t to lose weight \u2014 it\u2019s to be more active. But even in this respect, it didn\u2019t work nearly as well as we might hope. In the IDEA trial, those who employed the technology were no more physically active than those who didn\u2019t. They also weren\u2019t more fit.Many new technologies, and dietary supplements and new diets, are sold to the public with little actual research behind them. Wearable technology to encourage fitness is no different. Somehow, in the past few years, it has become collectively understood that we need to take 10,000 steps a day. But there\u2019s no magic behind that number. There\u2019s no reason to believe that hitting this arbitrary goal is somehow life-changing.It\u2019s possible that the devices helped me make physical activity part of my regular routine. It\u2019s possible that they provided a benefit. But my experience is just an anecdote, and there\u2019s no counterfactual to help figure out whether I\u2019d have become more active without the devices. For that, we\u2019d need a trial. The ones that exist (like the IDEA trial) argue that the devices don\u2019t make people exercise more.They don\u2019t seem to hurt, though. Other than costing money, there\u2019s no harm in seeing if it might improve your activity over time. But if your goal is weight loss, then you might think twice about using such a device. The evidence suggests that you may do better without one.Advertisement"}

James Poniewozik, The Times\u2019s chief television critic, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As our television critic, do you have a favorite television set, video projector or audio system? I\u2019m superagnostic about the sort of screen I use. I suppose this might be strange for a TV critic, but it also reflects the way people watch TV now \u2014 I\u2019ll watch shows or screeners on anything from the 55-inch TV in my living room to my phone on an exercise bike.My main work setup (my desk at home) is a laptop, a small LED TV set, and an iPad that I use as a second screen for streaming shows. More important to me than the screen are the peripherals: I have Apple TV and a couple of Rokus around the house, but I\u2019m still most loyal to my TiVo DVR \u2014 I\u2019ve had one almost since they went on the market in 1999.What do you like about it, and what could be better about your setup?Because I have so many shows to keep up with, it saves time: Any second I spend watching a commercial is time wasted. (This is the respect in which my TV habits are probably least like average viewers \u2014 I rarely see ads.) TiVo still has a far better interface than any cable company set-top box I\u2019ve encountered.What could be better: Cable companies are horrible, but particularly in New York City, where nearly all of us live under a de facto one-provider monopoly. (Supposedly I\u2019ll soon have the choice of Fios, which feels as if it\u2019s been taking longer to complete than the Second Avenue subway.)

As I write this, I\u2019m cooking a whole brisket with it, for the next 72 hours.How has it blown you away?What could be better about it?Unlike some other immersion wands, the Joule has no controls \u2014 you operate it entirely through an app. (I could operate it from anywhere with a phone connection.) It makes the machine smaller, and gives it a cool, minimalist Apple-device look, but I don\u2019t love needing to have Wi-Fi to cook a piece of salmon. Plus, I assume the Russians are using it to spy on me.When you\u2019re not watching TV and just want to read a book, do you use an e-reader or the old-fashioned print version?I use both. I actually find that having a physical book makes me more likely to focus on and finish what I\u2019m reading, but more and more often I default to the Kindle just because of the ease of downloading the e-book. (Even if it then stays on my device unread.)I was a late adopter of the device, though, and for years used the Kindle iOS app instead. I read the first four books of George R. R.

{"Headline": "To Keep U.S. Jobs, Chip Makers Share a Factory and Pin Hopes on Trump", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "Computer chips are still made in the United States, but foreign competition is looming. The industry wants President Trump to help.Supported byLEHI, Utah \u2014 Nestled at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains here, the IM Flash plant is a paragon of American high-tech manufacturing.Robots glide along the ceiling, moving silicon wafers the size of dinner plates between hulking machines that deposit and etch microscopic layers of material to build the most advanced memory chips in the world.For the 1,700 technicians and scientists who tend to the robots and troubleshoot problems in the delicate manufacturing process, the jobs offer generous pay and benefits and easy access to Utah\u2019s many outdoor attractions.For Intel and Micron Technology, the two American companies that jointly own and operate IM Flash, the venture allows both of them to sell cutting-edge, three-dimensional memory chips while sharing the multibillion-dollar costs of a modern semiconductor factory.The memory chips produced at the plant are \u201cprobably one of the biggest advances of technology in the last 20 years,\u201d said Jon Carter, who oversees Micron\u2019s strategy for new memory products. And, as he was quick to point out, all of the work was done in the United States. \u201cMicron has done a really good job of having a good footprint on the home front,\u201d he said.In many ways, however, the IM Flash plant is an outlier. While companies based in the United States still dominate chip sales worldwide, only about 13 percent of the world\u2019s chip manufacturing capacity was in this country in 2015, down from 30 percent in 1990, according to government data.Chip makers attribute the decline to a variety of forces, including high American tax rates and the hefty subsidies offered by foreign governments for new semiconductor plants, which can cost as much as $10 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a bit more expensive to build a factory in the U.S.,\u201d said Stacy J. Smith, the executive at Intel overseeing manufacturing, operations and sales. Intel \u2014 which predominantly manufactures in Oregon and Arizona but also has factories in Ireland, Israel and China \u2014 estimates that the extra cost for an American plant is more than $2 billion.Chip makers are hopeful that President Trump, who has promised large corporate tax cuts and a tougher approach to trade with China, will help them.Intel said it was talking with the Trump administration and Congress about a broad corporate tax cut as well as other ways to improve the financial incentives for chip makers to locate new projects here. Although the United States has 76 semiconductor plants, many of them are older, and few new ones are being built.Intel, whose work force relies heavily on highly skilled immigrants, is also pressing the administration to continue allowing such immigrants to enter the country. \u201cWe benefit from being able to hire the best talent from around the world,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The chip industry spends about one-fifth of its revenue on research and development, but it wants more federal funding for basic research into fundamental problems, like how to pack transistors closer together and whether materials other than silicon could form the basis of future chips.\u201cWe would like this administration to double down on investments in basic research in universities,\u201d said John Neuffer, the chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group that represents American chip makers. \u201cHelp us pedal faster.\u201dForeign countries have become more appealing for chip manufacturers, in part, because of the rise of contract chip foundries owned by Samsung of South Korea and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. They have made it easy for American tech companies like Qualcomm and Apple to design cutting-edge chips in the United States but outsource production to Asia.\u201cToday, it\u2019s a modest threat, but two, three, four years out, if China plays out as it plans, it could be very significant to subsectors of our industry,\u201d Mr. Neuffer said.Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., builds most of its chips in the United States. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, relies on company-owned plants in Asia for the majority of its production, but has a large American manufacturing presence. Both companies conduct most of their research and development in this country.The approach they have taken to 3-D memory chips illustrates the complexity of the business as well as the global forces pushing on the industry.The IM Flash plant in Lehi was built in 1994 and was Micron\u2019s first factory outside Boise. In 2005, Intel and Micron struck a partnership to expand the plant and make flash memory there, sharing costs and output.The two companies have spent the past 11 years developing the newest type of memory, which they call 3-D XPoint. The design combines the functions of a computer\u2019s ultrafast working memory and its slower, longer-term storage to create a hybrid aimed at companies like Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil, which need to process vast amounts of data reliably and at the highest speeds.David Kanter, the principal analyst at the research firm Real World Technologies, said the technology, which is still being tested by the first round of customers, was very promising. \u201cIt could the change the way that computing operates,\u201d he said.However, as with all new chip technologies, the initial products are likely to be expensive. The Lehi plant will continue to make traditional, cheap 2-D memory chips while gradually expanding production of the newer chips.Both companies have turned to foreign factories to hedge their bets with other products \u2014 less expensive, less capable 3-D flash memory designs aimed at the broad slice of the market that wants better performance but is unwilling to pay top dollar for the best technology available.Micron committed $4 billion to expand a plant it owns in Singapore to make the 3-D flash memory chips, which it began selling last year.Intel converted an aging factory it built a decade ago in Dalian, China, into one that produces state-of-the-art 3-D memory chips.\u201cChina is the largest market for us on the planet,\u201d said Mr. Smith of Intel. \u201cIt made sense to locate some production in China.\u201dIndeed, China is an integral part of Intel\u2019s long-term strategy. Although national security rules restrict the export of certain American chip technologies, the company has found other ways to operate in the country, where most of the world\u2019s computers and smartphones are built.Given China\u2019s position as the biggest buyer of American chips, the industry is concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of a trade battle with China. At the same time, chip makers believe that China has sometimes treated American companies unfairly and relish the idea of help from Washington on that front.Rob Magness, an IM Flash employee who works with the equipment that etches and polishes the silicon wafers, is optimistic, but said he knew just how fragile the industry was.During his 25 years making chips, he has seen employer after employer downsize and move factories offshore as they coped with the brutal economics of chip making.\u201cAll the places I came from are dying,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other two memory companies I worked for actually went under. The prices just got too cheap.\u201dAn article on Feb. 27 about computer chip makers\u2019 hopes that Trump administration policies will keep manufacturing in the United States referred incorrectly to the production of chips by Micron. The majority of them are made in Asia, not in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars Might Need Standards, but Whose?", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe PC revolution, the internet boom, the smartphone economy \u2014 all were propelled along by a common set of technological standards. So will a standard platform or operating system be necessary to get autonomous cars rolling, too?Car companies have come to realize that existing in-car systems, with their tangled layers of software and morass of hundreds of embedded processors, are slow and overly complex by today\u2019s computing standards. If autonomous cars are ever to become a reality, they will require even more powerful, more fully integrated and upgradable computing platforms, designers say.A more centralized approach could bring huge cost savings by reducing the number of processors used in a car and thus reducing the need for the cabling among those processors. Less wiring would also lower a car\u2019s weight to improve fuel economy, Mr. Shapiro said.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Mr. Montague said the challenge today is that every car has a unique constellation of electronic control units, sensors and microphones. The software must be specially tailored to each model.There is no shortage of companies vying to become the equivalent for self-driving cars of the Windows/Intel standard for PCs. Chip makers like Nvidia \u2014 as well as Intel \u2014 hope to establish their hardware as the new brains behind autonomous vehicles. Delphi, QNX and Waymo (the former Google self-driving project) are looking to put their software front and center as the operating system of choice. Each wants to sell its own car platform to automakers.The traditional automotive culture, however, has emphasized independence. And some industry experts point to economic factors that argue against settling on a standard platform. Being dependent on a single vendor can mean higher prices.\u201cAutomakers don\u2019t want to rely on Apple or Google,\u201d said Glen DeVos, vice president for software and services at Delphi. \u201cBut they also don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel all the time.\u201dEmblematic of that carmaker culture is Hyundai, which is mostly going it alone in working on its self-driving entry. The company recently demonstrated how far it has come, ferrying journalists in Las Vegas around in a self-driving version of its Ioniq electric compact car. Hyundai, which likes to emphasize that it even makes its own steel, has developed its own platform, striving for affordability.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use a common system,\u201d said Cason Grover, senior group manager for vehicle technology planning innovation at Hyundai. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to go down one path that hinders us in the future from introducing new innovations.\u201dBosch, which supplies safety and technology systems to automakers, including its own self-parking technology, acknowledges that a single, one-size-fits-all system would be easier to work with. \u201cBut it would be a killer for innovation,\u201d said Detlef Zerfowski, vice president for automotive system integration at Bosch.Douglas L. Davis of Intel, recently charged with spearheading that company\u2019s new self-driving car platform, Go, said, \u201cGiven the amount of computing power necessary for autonomous driving, we think it can benefit from greater commonality and predictable interfaces.\u201d\u201cMobileye already has the computer vision, for example,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if the technology is good, why re-engineer it and take two to three years to get it into a product?\u201dWhich design philosophy one chooses can have significant repercussions when it comes to the security of robotic cars, evoking visions of hackers causing mayhem by crashing cars and trucks into each other at highway speeds. It\u2019s a problem engineers are keenly aware of.\u201cHaving a common platform could have a downside,\u201d Mr. Wall at QNX acknowledged. \u201cIf there\u2019s a vulnerability in one car, it could mean there\u2019s a vulnerability in every car.\u201dConversely, Mr. Wall pointed out that de facto software standards mean that more programmers are focused on making those systems as secure as possible, versus having only a few coders working on a single, narrowly used program.But by developing as much of the technology as possible themselves, some automakers believe they can solve problems more quickly.\u201cA side benefit of controlling the entire thing,\u201d said Mr. Grover at Hyundai, \u201cis that we know everything that\u2019s going on.\u201dA lack of standards and a diversity of self-driving systems does present one other obvious challenge: Variety is not a virtue when cars must interact predictably with human drivers \u2014 and other robotic vehicles \u2014 to guarantee safety.Riding in Hyundai\u2019s self-driving Ioniq, for example, is like taking a Sunday drive with your grandmother. The car is extremely adept at staying squarely in its lane without ping-ponging back and forth, but it is also cautious in the extreme, stopping nine feet short of crosswalks and stubbornly refusing to go forward if a pedestrian looks poised to step off the sidewalk. It is behavior that can ignite road rage in nearby human drivers.By comparison, Delphi\u2019s test car, which uses an Intel computing platform installed in an Audi Q5, is more aggressive. It can easily merge into highway traffic and negotiate complex intersections. However, it treats pedestrians with less deference, taking right-hand corners more quickly \u2014 even though pedestrians may be contemplating entering the crosswalk.\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference in the algorithms and even sensor choices being used,\u201d Mr. Grover said, which can affect how collision-prevention and lane-keeping systems work. When autonomous cars do hit the road, he said, you could have a fair amount of variation in how they behave.\u201cThere are quite a few different approaches to creating autonomous systems,\u201d said Ralf Herrtwich of Here, which is making high-resolution maps for the next generation of vehicles. Mr. Herrtwich said the necessary standards might come not from the car platform itself, though, but from the communications side.Indeed, there are already cars like the 2017 BMW 5 Series that can broadcast information about road hazards over a cellular connection, but only other BMWs can make use of the warnings.Technology suppliers, platform vendors and automakers acknowledge that self-driving cars are still in their infancy and that as the vehicles mature, standards will be forthcoming.Most car manufacturers are still struggling just to establish standards across their own models and brands, Mr. DeVos of Delphi said.\u201cOnce that happens,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we can talk about how to work across different companies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here are some other things that happened.So a shocking thing happened this week: A subsidiary of Facebook copied a feature from Snapchat.I have no problem with this; as I\u2019ve argued repeatedly, I think it\u2019s generally good for consumers and innovation online when companies freely copy each other\u2019s best software ideas. Still, it\u2019s got to be just a little bit embarrassing for Facebook, which has been at the forefront of the social game for so long, to have completely run out of original ideas.As a columnist, I know that feeling well.Anyway, I\u2019m used to social media giants cloning each other\u2019s features, but I don\u2019t think WhatsApp should have gone in this direction.People loved WhatsApp partly because it is a zero-nonsense, intuitive chatting app. So now WhatsApp\u2019s new feature, called Status, basically lets people share images, GIFs or videos before they self-destruct in 24 hours. But do you know anyone who uses WhatsApp and desires features like these?I mostly see people using WhatsApp to keep in touch with others overseas. I\u2019m not sure this will stick with consumers or help Facebook lure people away from Snapchat. All it does is add a layer of complexity to what was otherwise a perfectly solid messaging app that everyone knew how to use.Uber has pledged an investigation on the sexism charges, but it\u2019s not at all clear that will be enough to quell the mounting anger against the company both internally and externally.So, where do you think this goes next?Mike\u2019s reporting on this fiasco was truly stunning, and Uber\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cWe are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone\u201d \u2014 is remarkable in that there is no denial or justification whatsoever of the aggressive, chauvinistic work culture.

{"Headline": "Tech Opposition to Trump Propelled by Employees, Not Executives", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late September, a group of tech leaders started a well-publicized effort to raise $100,000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324.For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent.No longer.Nearly 100 technology companies said that President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries would violate both immigration law and the United States Constitution.\u201cSilicon Valley is stepping up,\u201d said Sam Altman, who runs the valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, Y Combinator. \u201cThe companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don\u2019t support.\u201dIt is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable \u2014 not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.\u201cPeople voted with their feet, and Travis listened,\u201d said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. \u201cWe need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.\u201dResistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a voice with the president if you didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.\u201dWhen President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, he upended the fates of people who had waited for years to get into the U.S. Here are portraits of those affected by the ban.Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,\u201d said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey all have the same leanings.\u201dMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google\u2019s former slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is the most forceful expression of this.\u201cIf you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,\u201d Mr. Shotts said.Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards,\u201d and saying it would create \u201cmuch collateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dThe immigration battle is in Microsoft\u2019s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\u201cIn 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,\u201d said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. \u201cThe most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.\u201dMr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous \u201cfor the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren\u2019t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can\u2019t fix the monetization of fake news.\u201dPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.\u201cI\u2019ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,\u201d said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.He talked about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which asks women, \u201cWhat would you do if you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201d Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women\u2019s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.\u201cWe have to protest in public,\u201d he said. The event raised $30,000 for the legal aid groups.\u201cIt looked like two-thirds of the room were newcomers,\u201d Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement.\u201cI want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re pushing at least as hard as Trump is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buffett\u2019s $1 Trillion Target for Apple Is in Sight", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsWarren Buffett\u2019s $1 trillion target for the iPhone maker Apple is in sight. Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway boss, has bought more stock in Apple \u2014 whose market capitalization at Friday\u2019s closing price was $717 billion \u2014 and reckons it may become the first company with a 13-digit valuation. Breakingviews first suggested that back in 2011. Growth has slowed, but the company still looks undervalued.The tech giant, led by Timothy D. Cook, now trades at about 15 times estimated earnings for its financial year to September 2017. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index trades at about 19 times projected earnings for the same period. Moreover, Apple has nearly $250 billion of cash and equivalents, such a huge pot that most of it is invested in long-term securities \u2014 a category excluded from standard cash and net debt calculations.The quantum and treatment are so unusual that it is worth valuing Apple and its hoard of ready money separately. Put the company\u2019s underlying business on the same price-to-earnings multiple as the S.&P. and it is worth around $850 billion. Add back cash, net of the company\u2019s almost $90 billion of debt, and the company\u2019s potential market cap tops $1 trillion.Investors worry that the global smartphone market is saturated. Analysts think Apple\u2019s revenue will increase at a fairly modest 6 percent this financial year. However, as Mr. Buffett noted on CNBC on Monday, the company\u2019s products are \u201csticky,\u201d meaning most customers stay with the brand when they replace their phones. Services like apps, online data storage, payments and music are steadily growing. Heavy investment in developing new products may yet produce another Apple hit, too.There is also the concern that Apple will make big, overpriced acquisitions. Yet there is no evidence for this. Mr. Cook is stingy \u2014 the company\u2019s largest acquisition in 40 years was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014. It pays out roughly that amount every quarter in dividends, and on average about three times as much in buybacks.Perhaps investors simply can\u2019t get their heads around such a big number. If so, that could also be an issue for Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company Aramco, which is working toward floating an offering with a possible valuation of $2 trillion. It wouldn\u2019t take much of a shift in investors\u2019 attitude to get Apple to the $1 trillion mark first.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Plan Is Most Unfriendly to Outsiders", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorSnap Inc. is aiming to adopt the most shareholder-unfriendly governance in an initial public offering, ever.It is different from its predecessors, Facebook and Google, which went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. In recent years, Facebook and Google have revised this structure to add a nonvoting third class of shares to preserve founder control, yet shareholders have had at least some vote even if they couldn\u2019t sway the results.Snap has followed the natural evolution of this disenfranchisement, simply eliminating shareholder rights from the get-go. And this is not just about replicating the venture capital model, where founders get control but investors get board seats and veto rights over significant transactions. Here, Snap is not even giving crumbs.For gurus of good corporate governance, this is bad enough, but once you dig into the details of how this nonvoting stock works, it gets much worse for shareholders.Snap has set up three share classes. Class A will be offered to the public. These shares have no voting rights and no hope of ever having voting rights.Class B shares have one vote each and are convertible into Class A stock. These are shares held by prior investors and employees.Then there are the Class C shares, with 10 votes each, which are convertible into Class B stock. These shares are held in equal number by the two Snap co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy. Specifically, each of them holds 107,943,924 Class C shares. These shares will give the two men complete voting control over Snap.The two founders have a proxy arrangement that transfers voting control to the other if one dies, but it doesn\u2019t cover whether they vote their shares together while alive, so presumably they could deadlock. Snap has solved this problem by granting a performance stock award to Mr. Spiegel that will be 3 percent of the company\u2019s post-I.P.O. value.This award will be paid out in equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in the third full quarter after the offering. After this, Mr. Spiegel will have total control over Snap and Mr. Murphy will simply be a close second.Snap, which looks a lot like Twitter did at its I.P.O. stage, could also experience bumps in the road as Twitter did. In its prospectus, Snap calls itself a camera company, but it really has just one product, Snapchat, which is beloved by the younger crowd for its disappearing photos and texts.Facebook, Google and Microsoft as well as Amazon have survived because of the ability to provide multiple successful offerings. Twitter has struggled with just one product \u2014 the platform on which people the world over, including the American president, send 140-character messages called tweets.If things are going well, no one is going to question Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy\u2019s control. But if things are bad, then shareholder complaints may be valid, a spur to action. Indeed, control makes sense only if shareholders and the two executives disagree about whether things are going well. But that assumes that shareholders will be irrational or wrong or not know as much as the two men at the helm. The last point may have some validity \u2014 but is it worth complete disenfranchisement, again given that Snap is a very early-stage company and Mr. Spiegel is so young?I suppose it all might be palatable for most diversified investors in exchange for the huge potential upside, except for the last two parts of this scheme. First, in October Snap issued a dividend of one Class A share for each Class C share the two men owned. The result was to allow Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy to sell half their shares without worry of losing control. The company could reload this at any point, issuing out another dividend of Class A shares if the two need more money.So, barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die. This raises some interesting possibilities.Hypothetical Scenario 1: Mr. Spiegel is hit by a bus and dies. Mr. Murphy would now have complete control of the company. Yet Mr. Spiegel is supposed to be the visionary executive who justified this voting structure. Or is Mr. Murphy, 28, equally visionary? (Or perhaps it is more likely they are just executing well on the \u201cdisappearing pictures\u201d concept just as Mark Cuban executed well on \u201cinternet radio\u201d before selling broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for billions of dollars.)Hypothetical Scenario 2: At age 30, Mr. Spiegel decides that life as a billionaire married to a supermodel (he\u2019s engaged to Miranda Kerr) is more fun spent on an island in the Pacific. He quits his job but still holds Class C shares and wields his power to elect directors and run the company part time.Hypothetical Scenario 3: Mr. Spiegel continues to hold the shares and keep his day job and at age 50 is head of a middling internet company with great potential, but he refuses to give up control, or starts behaving erratically.Potential investors, particularly the big money managers like the BlackRocks of the world, should likely be asking themselves: Is it all worth it, given the risks? I\u2019d note here that Google has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Mr. Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook nonvoting stock. Does Mr. Spiegel deserve better than that? And remember the other tech titans, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, all have one share, one vote.In its prospectus, Snap says its team is \u201ckind, smart and creative,\u201d which is kind of like Whitney Houston singing, \u201cI believe that children are the future.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot of other stuff about growth and big ideas. Snap may be right, and Evan Spiegel truly is the second coming, but this just does not justify the extreme governance given the risk. Instead, it just seems silly, but not in the fun Snapchat sort of way.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Amid Immigration Furor, Apple\u2019s Chief Focuses on Apps and Music", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s next big business won\u2019t be a self-driving car or an improved smartwatch. It will be digital services like the App Store and Apple Music.The company said on Tuesday that such services brought in $7.2 billion in the quarter that ended in December, and $25.5 billion over the last 12 months.More difficult to predict is what the impact of President Trump\u2019s policies will be on Apple\u2019s business over the next four years.Mr. Cook said he was optimistic about corporate tax cuts proposed by Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress, and he noted that there was bipartisan support for reducing the tax on overseas profits that American companies must currently pay if they bring the money back to the United States.He said such changes would be good for Apple and for the country. As of Dec. 31, Apple had $246 billion in cash and marketable securities, most of it in foreign accounts.But in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published late Tuesday, he said that he has contacted senior people in the White House and that Apple is studying its legal options.On Friday, the president signed an executive order restricting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, prompting an outcry from Mr. Cook and other tech leaders. The administration is expected to issue another order soon that would change the rules for immigrant worker programs, including the H-1B visa program, which Apple and other tech companies rely on when filling many key jobs.Mr. Trump has also publicly called on Apple to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China.Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview on Tuesday, \u201cWe are working to understand what the new administration\u2019s standpoint is.\u201dThe strong growth in services will partly offset a slowdown in sales of Apple\u2019s flagship product, the iPhone. Apple said the number of iPhones sold rose just 5 percent in the first fiscal quarter, which ended in December, despite the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September. In the past, product upgrades have yielded bigger jumps in sales.\u201cFor a while now, we\u2019ve seen Apple take a step back from the iPhone and try to derive value from services,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst with the research firm Gartner.Over all, the company\u2019s financial results for the quarter were an improvement from the year before, when it struggled with declining revenue. Apple posted revenue of $78.4 billion for the quarter, up 3 percent compared with the previous year. Profits actually fell slightly, to $17.9 billion, but the company used some of its $27 billion in cash flow in the quarter to buy back millions of shares, so earnings per share rose slightly.Apple said it was seeing strong growth globally. In mainland China, sales were flat, after a long run of declines. Apple said its global revenue for the quarter was reduced by 1 percent because of the high value of the dollar. In some countries, Mr. Maestri said, Apple raised prices of its products by as much as 40 percent in local currency terms as the dollar rose.Mr. Cook said that Apple was continuing to explore new services. \u201cWe have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are learning from that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Apple, the richest company in technology, is finally moving into original video content.Apple said Monday night that it would introduce its first two television-style video series on Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, in the spring.Other original videos, including scripted dramas, are planned over the next year as Apple tries to build Apple Music into a cultural platform, said Jimmy Iovine, who heads the $10-a-month service.\u201cThere are a bunch of projects. We\u2019re in it. This is what Apple Music is going to be,\u201d Mr. Iovine said in an interview Monday night. \u201cApple Music will have video and other things that I can\u2019t talk about. We\u2019re going to be aggressive about it.\u201dApple is still primarily a smartphone company. And despite sitting on $246 billion in cash and marketable securities, it insists it has no short-term plans to directly challenge streaming-video giants like Netflix and Amazon, which are increasingly commissioning high-quality original shows to attract and retain subscribers.\u201cWe\u2019re not out to buy a bunch of shows,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for software and services, said during an onstage interview at the Code Media technology conference Monday night.But Apple does intend to use original video to help distinguish Apple Music, which began in June 2015 and has attracted than 20 million subscribers, from competitors like Spotify. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do things that are unique and cultural,\u201d Mr. Cue said.Much like MTV did in its heyday, that means going beyond music.\u201cWhat does it take to be an app developer? Who are they?\u201d Mr. Cue said, showing a trailer of the show with Ben Silverman, the veteran TV producer who brought the project to Apple. \u201cCustomers are going to love it.\u201dMr. Iovine said that Apple Music was also working on other video projects that are \u201cso opposite\u201d to the first two.\u201cWe\u2019re doing dramas,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just take much longer.\u201dAlso under consideration, he said, is a way for musicians to interact with their audiences. \u201cWe\u2019re still experimenting,\u201d he said.Apple, by contrast, had vast resources to invest in building a music service.Discussing Apple\u2019s broader video ambitions, Mr. Cue said that the company was currently focused on two problems: how to make it easier to discover already-available content, and how to make it easier for video creators to innovate.He dismissed suggestions, however, that Apple wanted to compete with cable and satellite companies by bundling a group of video channels and selling subscriptions to its users.\u201cWe are happy doing the things we are doing today,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere it goes, we don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stem Helps Split Royalties, and Takes Off as Music Distributor", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne answer was revealed on Sunday in an online ad promoting \u201cBlonde\u201d as one of the most acclaimed releases of 2016 and noting that it was \u201cpowered by Stem.\u201dThat service, which began only a year ago, has quickly become a player in a fast-growing corner of the music industry: online platforms that cater to independent artists by distributing their music to streaming services and organizing the many strands of royalties that accumulate from fans\u2019 clicks.Stem eliminates that burden by tracking every collaborator on a song, and requiring all parties to agree on percentage splits. Milana Rabkin, Stem\u2019s chief executive and one of its founders, compared the service to online payment apps that let friends easily split a restaurant tab.Stem\u2019s consensus model, however, could also be its Achilles\u2019 heel, since it will not allow any party to be paid until all agree on the splits, a process that gives holdouts bargaining power. Ms. Rabkin said that most projects reached consensus in a few days and that the longest had taken \u201ca couple months.\u201d The service takes a 5 percent cut on royalties.Representatives of Mr. Ocean declined to comment on exactly how he had used Stem. But aside from the album\u2019s initial appearance on Apple Music \u2014 when it was delivered directly to Apple \u2014 Stem appears to have been the vehicle used to release \u201cBlonde\u201d to most major services. Stem distributes music to Spotify, Apple, YouTube, Amazon, Tidal, SoundCloud and several other outlets.\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to reach a demographic that wants to create differently,\u201d said Kevin Breuner, the vice president of marketing at CD Baby. \u201cMusic distribution is a secondary thought to them.\u201dStem, by contrast, is catching on among a class of young professionals who often operate independently but may be involved in the highest creative levels of the business. Its clients include Childish Gambino and the electronic producer Deadmau5. The company says it has distributed 6,000 pieces of content that have been streamed 500 million times.Dina LaPolt, a lawyer representing Deadmau5, said her client was using Stem to track his music on YouTube, but explained that Stem\u2019s royalty-tracking system was particularly important to artists in managing the otherwise daunting task of tracking royalty splits.\u201cMusic is the only business in the world where the artist is responsible for doing all the paperwork,\u201d Ms. LaPolt said.The company\u2019s system, she said, allows her and friends to quickly and transparently arrange deals among themselves, maintaining control and minimizing any disruption to creativity.\u201cIt\u2019s essentially like a smart contract,\u201d Ms. Wise said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier and simpler, and I love easy and simple.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misstated the title of a Frank Ocean album.

{"Headline": "What Facebook Owes to Journalism", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorUnfortunately, his memo ignored two major points \u2014 the role that Facebook and other technology platforms are playing in inadvertently damaging local news media, and the one way they could actually save journalism: with a massive philanthropic commitment.Local news is weak in large part because the business models have collapsed. The main reason: As advertising spending shifted from print, TV and radio to the internet, the money didn\u2019t mostly go to digital news organizations. Increasingly, it goes to Facebook and Google.To be clear, Facebook and Google are not being malicious. This isn\u2019t like the tobacco industry knowingly trying to addict people to a product that kills them. Quite the contrary; these companies are sucking in the lion\u2019s share of digital advertising because the ad products they offer are so damn good. They are saving local businesses massive amounts of money.But just because the result is unintentional doesn\u2019t mean it is fantasy: Newsrooms have been decimated, with basic accountability reporting slashed as a result.A quick word about two other big players, Verizon and Apple. If Verizon, which owns AOL, succeeds in buying Yahoo, the combined company would become the third biggest recipient of digital advertising dollars, earning about 10 percent.I\u2019m not saying that the good stuff \u2014 the mobile revolution, blocking intrusive ads, better marketing options for small businesses \u2014 doesn\u2019t outweigh the bad. And local news organizations absolutely contributed to the problem with their sluggish and often uncreative reaction to the digital revolution. But we still need to accept that \u201cdisruption\u201d does disrupt, and occasionally some of what gets overturned is extremely important. When that happens \u2014 and if adequate market-based solutions haven\u2019t materialized \u2014 philanthropy must step in, too.In the last ten years or so, there has been a bit of an increase in philanthropic support for journalism. But if you look closely, a few things stand out.The next thing you notice is the four names that are missing from the list of 89 foundations that contributed during those two years: the foundations connected to Facebook, Google, Verizon and Apple. The Tulsa Community Foundation donated more to help investigative journalism than those four combined.If we go back further in time, the pattern persists: $145 million was donated for investigative journalism by 374 foundations from 2009 to 2016. There was one from the big four \u2014 $10,000 in 2011 to the Bronx News Network.As a reminder, these companies have not exactly been financially struggling. In 2016, the four posted a combined net income of $88 billion ($19.4 for Google, $10.2 for Facebook, $13 billion for Verizon and $45 billion for Apple). By contrast, the combined net income for The New York Times, Gannett and McClatchy was $41 million.But while training, technology and innovation are critical, what journalism needs most now is money, and lots of it \u2014 to fund full-time local journalists. What these companies have donated so far is too little given how wealthy they are, how much harm they\u2019re (inadvertently) doing \u2014 and how much good they could do.If the leaders of these companies put the equivalent of just 1 percent of their profits, for five years, to the cause, local American journalism would be transformed for the next century.There\u2019s no doubt that the digital revolution \u2014 built in no small part by these four companies \u2014 has made reporting much easier for the journalists still remaining in local newsrooms. But we urgently need far more of those journalists.These companies are among the biggest beneficiaries of the digital disruption that has, among other things, caused the crisis in American journalism. It\u2019s time for the disrupters to solve these problems. They have the money, the know-how and the obligation.An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a Google co-founder. It is Sergey Brin, not Sergie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Long Way From Mexico: Company Bets China Has an Appetite for Taco Bell", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Until he was appointed manager of a Taco Bell in China, Will Cao had never seen a taco before. When confronted with its hard, U-shaped shell in Los Angeles last June, he wondered: How do you eat it?\u201cEverything was spilling all over the place,\u201d said Mr. Cao, a 31-year-old Shanghai resident. \u201cThen I looked at the other customers to learn that, actually, you are supposed to tilt your neck to eat it.\u201dMr. Cao\u2019s employer is betting that other Chinese diners will figure it out. Yum China, the company behind KFC there, last month opened the first Taco Bell in China in years, and says it plans to open an unspecified number more. The company is turning to double-layered tacos and overstuffed quesadillas in hopes of regaining ground in a market where its fried chicken has shown the limits of its appeal.It won\u2019t be easy. First, there is the matter of what\u2019s on the menu: Mexican food. Tacos and burritos are virtually unknown in China, where many diners prize aspirational noshes from America, Japan and Europe and look skeptically at what they see as poorer fare from other developing countries.And in a feature rare in America \u2014 perhaps for good reason \u2014 the China store offers Japanese beer and alcoholic slushes.Yum China is aware of the magnitude of the challenge. Micky Pant, its chief executive, says eating a taco is \u201ca whole new way of learning.\u201dThe company is learning its own lessons. In the 1990s, Chinese consumers flocked to KFC and other Western fast-food chains, drawn by their clean bathrooms and air-conditioning \u2014 a novelty in China at that time. But restaurants like McDonald\u2019s and KFC have since struggled against increasing competition from quick-service Chinese restaurant chains and a shift toward healthier eating.While China is still a lucrative market for companies including Apple, Nike and Starbucks, other American firms are finding the going tougher than it used to be. The once seemingly insatiable appetite for all things foreign has stalled in a marketplace where domestic brands are catching up and consumers are richer, with more choices than ever.That led to Yum China\u2019s gamble on Taco Bell. Instead of Taco Bell\u2019s American approach \u2014 quick, cheap, often unabashedly junky \u2014 the Shanghai restaurant seems intent on easing Chinese diners into ordering. The menu in China features enlarged images of foods on a lighted board and a transparent kitchen, where skeptical customers can watch their food being assembled.Yum dropped fajitas because focus groups said Chinese people did not like the \u201cpeppery type of spiciness that Westerners like,\u201d said Jimmy Chen, senior director of Yum China\u2019s brand development division. Chinese consumers wanted warm cheese on their tacos, not the cold grated variety offered in the United States. They asked for alcohol to be offered.The bean burrito was \u201ccontroversial,\u201d Mr. Chen said; while some Chinese who had studied abroad considered it a must, others found two types of starches layered on top of one another unfamiliar. Ultimately the bean burrito was booted.Said Mr. Chen, \u201cWe just need a little more time.\u201dYum has tried Taco Bell in China before. In 2003 it opened full-service restaurants called \u201cTaco Bell Grande\u201d in Shanghai, then in the southern city of Shenzhen, offering higher-end fare like steaks and fajitas. But it pulled out five years later.\u201cThey had little Chinese girls with sombreros on them looking ridiculous,\u201d said Joel Silverstein, president of the consultancy East West Hospitality Group and a former senior executive with PepsiCo restaurants, the onetime parent of Yum Brands. \u201cThat was a complete disaster.\u201dIn 2012, Chinese news media reported that KFC chicken suppliers used antibiotics and growth hormones in their meat, news that hurt sales and prompted Yum to cut its number of suppliers. The company emphasized that its food was safe. Two years later, a Chinese state-run broadcaster reported that a meat supplier used by Yum was suspected of selling expired meat. Yum terminated the supplier, which was later fined about $3.5 million by regulators in Shanghai. Sales growth weakened after both episodes, and by 2015 sales at stores that had been open for at least a year continued to decline.Adding to the decline: an increasingly sophisticated customer base that eschews Western fast food for other options. \u201cThe biggest challenge is making the connection with the younger generation,\u201d said Ye Liyan, marketing director in China for Pizza Hut.In its own effort to refurbish, Pizza Hut is rolling out \u201cconcept stores\u201d across China \u2014 in Shanghai, one features a robot waiter and a table with a built-in screen for customers to build their own pizzas.Taco Bell may be an unlikely restaurant to connect. \u201cChinese people have mostly admired things from Europe and the United States,\u201d said Darcy Zhang, a food blogger based in Shanghai. \u201cBut Mexico itself is a developing country, and so many Chinese people would wonder why they would have to try Mexican food.\u201dYum China formally opened the Taco Bell on Jan. 9 in Shanghai\u2019s prime Lujiazui area, a popular tourist spot. The former basketball star Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who made the famous \u201cTaco Neck\u201d commercial in 1995, participated in a taco-eating competition.On a recent Tuesday, the store was packed at lunch, with a 15-minute wait to get a table. Diners sat on chairs below surfboards suspended from ceilings. Workers in polo shirts served margaritas and draft beer.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t tell me, I wouldn\u2019t even know this was Mexican food,\u201d said Zang Jing, 30, a bank clerk, adding that she thought the food was \u201cnot bad.\u201dLiu Xiaoyi, chief editor of a local food guide, said she believed Mexican food could take off in China because people are \u201cwilling to try new things.\u201d\u201cThey are willing to listen to people telling them, \u2018You have to look at it from a different angle to appreciate it, it\u2019s not the same as a Chinese meal but it\u2019s also delicious,\u2019\u201d she said after photographing her burrito.Her friend, Zhu Li, disagreed. \u201cIt really does not look good when you eat it,\u201d said Ms. Zhu, 45, an insurance agent.\u201cIt\u2019s all over your hands and dripping on the table. It just makes me uncomfortable.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

How do I decide what to buy?What do you use?Because of my job, I get to know the perfect headphone for every situation. I think I regularly rotate among seven pairs.I always spend a week using any potential top pick before we post a review so I can troubleshoot. I\u2019ve caught a few problems that way. And yes, I\u2019ve even done that with the kids\u2019 headphones. I have a surprisingly small hat size.Why aren\u2019t the new Apple cordless earbuds on the list?Do headphones and earbuds really have to cost so much?Some technology, like a Bluetooth antenna or an active noise-canceling circuit, is going to cost a manufacturer a certain amount for the components and licensing fees. A manufacturer can\u2019t get them into a product for any less. That sets a base manufacturing cost. So a good pair of in-ear sport Bluetooth headphones, a solid product that will last you a few years, costs about $99.Anything below that will likely suffer in some way. To some people, that\u2019s O.K. But you can\u2019t expect magic for $30. On the other end, when you\u2019re paying over $300, you are getting a combination of innovation, product quality and sound quality. But a lot of times, anything much above that, it\u2019s just plain old marketing and hype.Are you thinking of any particular headphones?In the audio quality category, there\u2019s the planar magnetic Oppo, Audeze, Mr. Speakers, brands like that. They range from $400 and up. Bose has the best active-noise-canceling technology available, and it\u2019s because the company spent a ton of money on research and development. And of course, Beats has the market cornered on branding. They\u2019ve been making a lot of improvements to their sound quality. But the difference between them and others priced that high is that you\u2019re paying $150 to $200 for sound and adding on another $100 or so for the Beats label.What\u2019s your dream product?There\u2019s the elusive unicorn: headphones that do everything well and work in any situation.
