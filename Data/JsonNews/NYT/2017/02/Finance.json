{"Headline": "New York Tries to Revive Garment Industry, Outside the Garment District", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike generations of garment workers before him, Max Hernandez came to New York City to get his start behind a sewing machine.Only he could not find any work. After more than a year of looking, Mr. Hernandez, 25, finally spotted a Craigslist ad for a $12-an-hour sewing job with UZI, a tiny company in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, that makes dresses for Anthropologie, among others.\u201cNew York City is the center of the fashion world, but hardly any of it is made here,\u201d said Mr. Hernandez, who beat out a dozen other applicants for the job. After several promotions, he now makes $15.50 an hour.As Fashion Week unfolds on glittering runways this week, the city\u2019s once-thriving garment manufacturing industry has little to celebrate. Many companies are struggling with rising rents and labor costs and outdated work spaces and losing business to competitors overseas who can make clothes more cheaply. Block after block of factories and showrooms have disappeared from the renowned garment district in Manhattan, replaced by technology, media and consulting companies that focus on the design and marketing side of the business, if they are even connected to fashion.There were just 22,626 city residents age 16 and older making apparel, accessories and finished textile products in 2015, a small fraction of the peak of 323,669 workers in 1950, and less than half of the 59,049 workers in 2000, according to an analysis of census data by Queens College.A city-financed marketing and advertising campaign \u2014 \u201cMade in New York\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that promotes film and television productions and technology companies has been expanded to highlight locally made fashions with advertisements on newsstands, bus shelters and in Women\u2019s Wear Daily, a publication that covers the industry.\u201cEverybody thinks of fashion as all glitz, but this is a homegrown industry with everyday New Yorkers working behind the scenes,\u201d said Alicia Glen, deputy mayor, who oversees the city\u2019s economic development. \u201cFashion manufacturing puts food on the table for tens of thousands of families. And it needs room to grow. What\u2019s \u2018Made in New York\u2019 is good for New York.\u201dCurrently, there are 1,568 garment manufacturing companies in the five boroughs. The largest concentration, 419 companies, remains clustered in or around the garment district, even as manufacturing space there has shrunk to 830,000 square feet from 1.1 million square feet as recently as 2009.\u201cThe streets used to be lined with trucks that were picking up or delivering to the garment district,\u201d recalled Frank Dara, 71, who spent decades cutting fabric for companies. \u201cToday, if you see 10 percent of what it used to be, that\u2019s a lot.\u201dSteven Kolb, the chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, said local garment manufacturers were as vital as ever to the city\u2019s fashion industry. Local companies are often more willing to accept small orders and take chances on new designers than overseas manufacturers, he said. They can also turn around clothes more quickly, and their proximity allows designers to monitor production more closely.\u201cThe closer you are to production, the better,\u201d said Mr. Kolb, adding that it was the difference between having \u201ca long-distance relationship with a boyfriend in L.A.\u201d and one in which \u201cyou live in the West Village and he lives in the East Village.\u201dFor many companies, the biggest hurdle is finding a place they can afford. UZI has hopscotched from one home to another on the Lower East Side and in Brooklyn, moving each time the rent increased. Today, it makes about 600 dresses a month in a 900-square-foot studio in a walk-up building in Sunset Park. It is so cramped that fabrics have to be stored in another building three blocks away.\u201cYou know how heavy a bolt of fabric is?\u201d said Mari Gustafson, a co-founder of UZI. \u201cThree long blocks with 70 yards of fabric on my shoulder is going to eventually lead to my body falling apart. The main challenge is getting enough space at a reasonable price.\u201dMore than 100 garment manufacturers have settled in the Sunset Park area, including 10 companies that lease space at below-market rates in the sprawling Brooklyn Army Terminal and another city-owned building. Last month Mr. Kolb took 25 factory owners on a tour of Sunset Park, saying that in the last decade more companies have become willing to leave Manhattan.On a recent morning, jackets were being assembled by women behind Juki industrial sewing machines at Bestec Concept in the Army Terminal. The company, which makes military uniforms, opened a second production site in the 37,500-square-foot space last year after running out of room in its Queens factory.A $300,000 machine that cuts fabric with lasers sat nearby, ready to do the work of three people; its cost was partly covered by a grant from the Fashion Manufacturing Initiative. Peter Kim, 46, a co-president of the company, said the machine \u2014 the size of three pool tables \u2014 would not have fit in the Queens factory, but at the Army Terminal, it was simply loaded onto a huge freight elevator and rolled out onto the floor.Malia Mills is another recent arrival in Sunset Park. Ms. Mills, 50, moved her company to an 11,000-square-foot loft in Industry City, a complex of redeveloped buildings, in 2014 after it outgrew its previous home in the garment district.Ms. Mills now has enough space for a \u201cfabric library\u201d and plans to add more sewing machines and equipment. She declined to disclose her rent, saying only that it was about half as much as what she previously paid. She has used the savings to expand her business, including opening two new stores in California and a temporary pop-up store in Houston. \u201cI wish we had done it sooner,\u201d she said of the move.There has also been an unexpected benefit: neighbors with skills other than fashion. She has called upon a pillow manufacturer, a furniture maker and a technology consultant, among others, for help and ideas about running her business.\u201cYou are learning from one another,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a diversity of products and mind-sets that you find out here that is amazing. It has broadened my perspective.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conservative Groups Unify to Push Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Confirmation", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 They are three dozen of the best-financed, most battle-hardened players in the conservative movement \u2014 among them, the Koch network, the National Rifle Association and leading evangelical and anti-abortion groups.Their grass-roots organizations extend to precincts and parishes in all 50 states. And their causes span the full spectrum of issues that animate the right\u2019s most devoted followers, meaning they don\u2019t always see eye to eye.But on this they agree: They cannot take any chances that President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court is stopped.Mr. Trump\u2019s final choice was almost a moot point.The design and messaging \u2014 \u201cEmergency Call to Action!\u201d \u2014 were already set. All the group needed to do was to plug in Judge Gorsuch\u2019s name and picture into the blank spaces on its template.Where Trump\u2019s nominee falls on the court\u2019s ideological spectrum.\u201cThe Supreme Court unifies our whole team more than anything else \u2014 and we do usually have more trouble than the left in being unified,\u201d said Gary Marx, who is coordinating the coalition\u2019s grass-roots efforts for the Judicial Crisis Network.\u201cIn this Week 1 and Week 2,\u201d he vowed, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see shock and awe.\u201d The Judicial Crisis Network has said it will spend $10 million on a campaign to support Mr. Gorsuch.In a demonstration of how closely Mr. Trump plans to rely on the coalition, he gathered several of its leaders at the White House on Wednesday, including the N.R.A. president, Wayne LaPierre; the antitax activist Grover Norquist; and Marjorie Dannenfelser, who heads the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion. The scene, in the Roosevelt Room, was a vivid reminder of how the changeover in Washington has opened the White House door to conservative movement players who found themselves shut out for the last eight years.The breadth of their effort underscores what the movement considers to be at stake. Business regulations, abortion restrictions, religious expression and voting rights could all be before the court in the coming years.In an attempt to placate skeptical conservatives during his campaign, he took the unprecedented step of providing movement leaders with the list of names from which he would pick, leaving activists reasonably assured that they would be comfortable with his decision. They felt that assurance because many of them \u2014 including those now working on the Gorsuch confirmation campaign \u2014 suggested the names in the first place.\u201cHe was smart enough to understand that he needed to make that promise, and in a highly tangible and credible way,\u201d said Ralph Reed, founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and one of the conservative leaders Mr. Trump invited to the White House on Tuesday to watch the Gorsuch announcement. \u201cThat was, of course, because of the deep paranoia on the right that he would betray them.\u201dNow, many of them \u2014 and more \u2014 are going to battle for him. The Susan B. Anthony List is working to pressure Democratic senators facing re-election in 2018.The Family Research Council is planning a simulcast that will be broadcast in evangelical churches across the country to rally support for Judge Gorsuch. \u201cThe presidential election energized people in a way I have not seen,\u201d said Tony Perkins, the group\u2019s president, who was also at the White House on Tuesday night. \u201cThe evangelical community is engaged. They\u2019re basically waiting for direction.\u201dThe network financed by Charles and David Koch will engage four of their organizations \u2014 Americans for Prosperity; Concerned Veterans for America; Generation Opportunity, a millennial-focused group; and the Libre Initiative, a Hispanic-focused group. Ads, phone calls and door knocking are part of a plan that could reach seven figures, which would be a considerable investment considering the Kochs refused to support Mr. Trump during the campaign.In a Republican Party that is already showing signs of strain over the frenzied first two weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the confirmation process could be a unifier, especially if Democrats begin to quickly and aggressively resist. And it could provide a fresh impetus at a time when the left is showing its own signs of organization and mobilization.\u201cThe fact of the matter is, we\u2019ve never had a movement that has this kind of breadth and depth,\u201d said Leonard Leo, a veteran of previous confirmation fights who has been advising Mr. Trump\u2019s White House on the selection.Mr. Leo attributed the passion to what he said was the emphasis that conservatives place on the court. \u201cArmies that are premised on fundamental principles are bigger and they are more committed,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rethinking Retirement for Longer Lives With Fewer Safety Nets", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive days a week, Kim Moske makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and brown-bags it to work. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing that for 30 years and saving what I would have spent eating my lunch out someplace,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s added up to a lot of money, and truthfully, I don\u2019t care what I eat for lunch.\u201dThat is a small gesture, but it is indicative of the advantages of making daily choices to help save for a financially secure retirement.Ms. Moske, 56, lives in Delaware, Ohio, and is a project manager for a small manufacturing firm. She expects to retire in six years. But it has not been all about homemade sandwiches: She started to save and invest in her late 20s.That foresight and discipline have made it possible for her to envision a fairly traditional retirement \u2014 one that will allow her time to pursue hobbies like gardening, hiking in Hocking Hills State Park or biking along the Olentangy River near her home, and traveling.\u201cI\u2019m not one of these who has to go to Paris, but it would be fun to finish seeing all the 50 states,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve visited 30 of them.\u201dMs. Moske grew up in a family \u201cwhere we were always getting utilities shut off,\u201d she said. \u201cWe lived in fear that our car would be repossessed, and we frequently ran out of milk. I was raised by two people who were very good at wasting money and very poor at managing it. They were a financial disaster.\u201d\u201cMy father worked very hard his entire life and made a good income, yet he died penniless at age 78,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m frugal to a fault. Therefore my retirement is in pretty good shape.\u201dMs. Moske is proof that it is never too early to start working on your retirement plan. Fewer workers today have traditional pensions than in the past, life expectancies are generally longer and, with unknowns like health care costs and inflation in the coming decades, planning is more important than ever.When Ms. Moske was 26 and working full time to pay her way through college, she signed up for a class on finance and investing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a stock from a cornstalk, but I realized that I needed to take control,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband and I immediately started living on less than what we needed, saving and investing.\u201dMoney was tight during the dozen years that she stayed home to raise the couple\u2019s two children, now 20 and 22. She also missed out on those years of employer-provided retirement savings.Then, six years ago, her husband died from injuries sustained in a fall. That caused a seismic shift not only emotionally, but also financially, as she had to live on one income. But she paid off her home, now valued at around $300,000, with a portion of the money she received from her husband\u2019s life insurance policy.\u201cI will be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t go it alone: I meet with a financial planner once a year to make sure I am on track, and I check retirement calculators all the time.\u201dIn many ways, she is an anomaly.Fred Blanton, a business and marketing consultant in Houston, does not have \u201ca big golden nest egg,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be 65 in a few months, but I need an income. I have enough money if I live another 15 years, but am I going to die at 80?\u201d\u201cThe 65 retirement age for Social Security was put in place in 1933 when retirement lasted eight to 10 years,\u201d Mr. Blandin said. \u201cIn the old pension system, people didn\u2019t have to make decisions on how much to contribute to a retirement account, which investments to grow their nest egg, how big of a nest egg they would need, what to do with the nest egg when changing jobs and how much to withdraw on an annual basis in retirement.\u201dIt is essential to get a \u201csnapshot of your financial picture ASAP,\u201d Mr. Blandin said. For example, how much have you already saved for retirement? How much are you saving annually as a percentage of your income? Can you bump it up? How is it invested? Have you used a retirement calculator to run the numbers? Have you worked with a financial planner to help you create a blueprint?Even people who save conscientiously, he said, are not necessarily paying close attention to the details of the financial products they purchase, investment fees, planning for health care in retirement, inflation and other factors that will affect their future.\u201cSaving and planning for retirement among the self-employed requires a do-it-yourself approach,\u201d said Catherine Collinson, president of the Transamerica Center and executive director of the Aegon Center. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t have an employer, they typically lack access to the employer-sponsored retirement benefits that so many workers enjoy.\u201d\u201cThey also often encounter fluctuations in income,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich makes it that much more challenging to save on a consistent basis.\u201dAbout one-third of self-employed workers always make sure they are saving for retirement, according to the report. Less than a quarter say they save for retirement on an occasional basis, or that they have saved for retirement in the past but are not currently doing so.Even for those who have saved enough to retire comfortably, working for pay in retirement can help provide a safety net and peace of mind. It helps people put off dipping into retirement accounts and may even allow some to continue contributing to their retirement savings.The pay can also help provide a cushion to allow someone to delay tapping into Social Security until age 70, which increases annual Social Security income by nearly 8 percent compared with retiring at the full retirement age. The income can also help with medical bills not covered by Medicare.For Michael L. Stark, 66, chief operating officer at American Financial Network in Calabasas, Calif., the decision to stay on the job is straightforward. He loves what he does and believes that he is still on a learning curve. He has flexibility in his hours and a short commute to work, leaving him time to spend with his three grandchildren and on leisure activities like skiing and hiking.\u201cI am not wealthy by any means, but my wife and I have done O.K. saving,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have retired a couple of years ago, but I am not mentally or physically ready to retire right now.\u201dRetirement is about a lot more than just hitting financial targets. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking a more holistic approach to our longer lives,\u201d Ms. Dychtwald said. \u201cDespite the challenges, retirees are generally adaptable. They are willing to make a wide array of course corrections, trade-offs and adjustments \u2014 from continuing some form of work, to downsizing or relocating their home, to renting out a spare bedroom or living with a roommate \u2014 which offer the chance to create more financial security.\u201dAs for Ms. Moske, when she retires she plans to buy a small condo in Florida where she can go for the winter months. Thinking of her brown-bag habits, she laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll name it PB&J.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.S. Monaco: From Billionaire\u2019s Plaything to Soccer Prodigies\u2019 Hub", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONACO \u2014 Looking back, Vadim Vasilyev can pinpoint the precise moment A.S. Monaco changed. Vasilyev, the club\u2019s vice president, can name a place \u2014 the Grimaldi Forum, a grand conference center on the Monte Carlo seafront \u2014 and a date: Sept. 21, 2015.That evening, around 1,000 of Monaco\u2019s most ardent fans packed into a hall to hear what Vasilyev \u2014 accompanied by Leonardo Jardim, the club\u2019s coach, and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan, its captain then \u2014 had to say for himself.Over the previous two summers, those fans had watched as one of the most ambitious projects in European soccer seemed to crumble. Monaco had spent hundreds of millions of dollars acquiring some of soccer\u2019s brightest stars; now they were all being allowed to leave.James Rodr\u00edguez went to Real Madrid in 2014; a year later, Yannick Ferreira Carrasco joined him across the city at Atl\u00e9tico; Radamel Falcao joined Manchester United, then Chelsea; Geoffrey Kondogbia left for Inter Milan.And then, a few weeks before the meeting in Monte Carlo and on the eve of the season, Anthony Martial, a young French forward of blistering promise, had been sold to United. In 12 months, Monaco had gone from a boutique of shimmering luxury to an apparently endless fire sale. The fans wanted answers.\u201cThey were really angry,\u201d Vasilyev said. \u201cWe had many departures that summer. They needed someone to go out and face them.\u201d Over the course of several hours \u2014 at first onstage, and then over drinks and petits fours \u2014 Vasilyev did just that.\u201cIt was not the time to hide,\u201d Vasilyev said. \u201cI decided to go out in front of them and say we had no other way. I asked them, \u2018Do you want to go back to the second division?\u2019 I said it will be tough, but this is the road now.\u201cIt was difficult, yes,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut in the end, they started asking me for pictures. That evening was the turning point.\u201dJust how drastic the transformation has been should be amply demonstrated when Monaco faces Manchester City in the round of 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday.The glamour conjured by the club\u2019s name remains, of course, too intricately woven into the fabric of the team to ever disappear. Monaco is still partly owned by the royal family; its players still wear a jersey inspired, according to the officially endorsed history, by Princess Grace; its home, the Stade Louis II, is still nestled between two marinas, thronged with superyachts. It is still, and always will be, the team from the billionaire\u2019s playground.Since that fractious evening in the Grimaldi Forum, though, Monaco has completely discarded its identity as the team run as if it were a billionaire\u2019s plaything.That is what Monaco was not so long ago, of course, when its benefactor, Dmitry Rybolovlev, bankrolled a spending spree impressive even by European soccer\u2019s inflated standards.Rybolovlev, a Russian petrochemical magnate, bought the club in 2011 when it was languishing in France\u2019s second division.\u201cEven then, he told me quite a few times that his ambition was to win the Champions League,\u201d said Tor-Kristian Karlsen, who became Monaco\u2019s sporting director in January 2012.Rybolovlev poured money into his scouting system and brought in a high-profile manager, Claudio Ranieri. Rybolovlev commissioned a host of signings, most notably the Argentine teenager Lucas Ocampos, a deal inspired by Rybolovlev\u2019s desire to sign \u201cthe most promising teenager in the world who was attainable,\u201d Karlsen said.More important, at Karlsen\u2019s instigation, Rybolovlev established contacts with Jorge Mendes, the most influential agent in the sport. The relationship would prove crucial when Monaco was promoted, in 2013, and promptly signed three of the most expensive players in French league history: Rodr\u00edguez, Falcao and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, all Mendes players, among several others.Monaco seemed the most potent of European soccer\u2019s cadre of arriviste clubs, doubling down on the pattern set by Chelsea, Manchester City and Paris St.-Germain. Four years on, though, only echoes of that era remain: Moutinho and Falcao, who returned last year, will both be in Manchester this week. The club around them is almost the polar opposite to the one they joined.Jardim\u2019s team is built around young talent; Vasilyev declares with pride that Monaco is self-financing and sustainable. Karlsen said Rybolovlev was always \u201cinterested in buying players of a certain age, from certain places, to find out if we could benefit from the transfer market,\u201d even when he was purchasing stars. Now it is those players \u2014 the promising and the hungry \u2014 who are Monaco\u2019s sole focus.The result has been eye-catching. Monaco is in the knockout stages of the Champions League and, more impressive, atop Ligue 1, which many had expected to be a cakewalk for Paris St.-Germain. Monaco is enjoying rather more success as a hothouse for talent than it did as a retreat for stars.And yet, as Vasilyev said, that change was \u201cnot really part of the plan.\u201d Monaco always intended to change, but \u201cnot so quickly,\u201d he said.By the time of that meeting in the Grimaldi Forum, it had become clear there was no other choice. In part, Vasilyev attributes that to errors he and Rybolovlev made: They expected big-name players to draw both sponsors and fans, but they did not. Commercial deals did not materialize. Monaco\u2019s famously sparse crowds did not improve. The club\u2019s revenue would never catch up with its expenditure.In addition, the year that Monaco\u2019s spending stunned Europe, when Falcao and the rest arrived, was the year that UEFA\u2019s financial fair-play regulations \u2014 designed to force clubs to live within their means \u2014 started to bite.By the end of that season, Manchester City and P.S.G. had been fined, and placed under transfer restrictions, for breaching the rules. Vasilyev, too, was summoned to Nyon, Switzerland, where UEFA is headquartered, and asked to explain his club\u2019s finances. Monaco, too, faced onerous penalties.\u201cWhen we started, the rules of financial fair play existed but had not been implemented,\u201d Vasilyev said. \u201cNobody really knew how real it would be.\u201dWhen it became clear it was very real indeed, Monaco knew it had to change tack. Rybolovlev scaled back his spending in 2014, and sold Rodr\u00edguez, too; by 2015, the exodus was in full flow.In hindsight, it would be easy for Monaco to resent its compliance with the regulations, which have since been watered down. As Vasilyev points out, the rules still exist, but they look more like guidelines now. If Monaco had gritted its teeth and accepted the fines \u2014 as Manchester City and P.S.G. did \u2014 it might still have its team of stars.Vasilyev expressed some regret. \u201cWe went to extremes to be in compliance,\u201d he said. \u201cSome other clubs took it less seriously and got off with it.\u201dA better word, though, might be serendipity. \u201cIn the end, it was a good thing for us,\u201d Vasilyev said of the financial fair-play regulations. \u201cIt is one of the reasons we were galvanized to change and find our proper model.\u201dMonaco is in no doubt that while it might have come to this road by accident, it is a happy one. It has a team filled with bright promise and a growing reputation as the ideal place for prodigies. Last summer, Djibril Sidib\u00e9, a defender, chose Monaco ahead of Arsenal.\u201cHe knows if he excels here, he will then be able to choose any club at all,\u201d Vasilyev said.Monaco knows its place, knows that sooner or later it will have to cash in on its prospects and allow them to fly the nest. It does so, though, only when the time is right: A $65 million offer from China\u2019s Tianjin Quanjian in January for the resurgent Falcao was turned down.\u201cEventually, we are a selling club,\u201d Vasilyev said. \u201cBut we do not have to sell if we do not want to.\u201dThat was the plan Vasilyev laid out that evening at the Grimaldi Forum: a road that took the club off in a different direction, but one that may yet lead to the same destination.Advertisement"}

Bannon, on the dining patio. If you are lucky, the president himself could stop by your table for a quick chat. But you will have to pay $200,000 for the privilege \u2014 and the few available spots are going fast.Virtually overnight, Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s members-only Palm Beach, Fla., club, has been transformed into the part-time capital of American government, a so-called winter White House where Mr. Trump has entertained a foreign head of state, health care industry executives and other presidential guests.But Mr. Trump\u2019s gatherings at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 he arrived there on Friday afternoon, his third weekend visit in a row \u2014 have also created an arena for potential political influence rarely seen in American history: a kind of Washington steakhouse on steroids, situated in a sunny playground of the rich and powerful, where members and their guests enjoy a level of access that could elude even the best-connected of lobbyists.President Trump was shown responding to a national security crisis during dinner on Saturday night at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach Fla., as members and guests looked on.Membership lists reviewed by The New York Times show that the club\u2019s nearly 500 paying members include dozens of real estate developers, Wall Street financiers, energy executives and others whose businesses could be affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. At least three club members are under consideration for an ambassadorship. Most of the 500 have had memberships predating Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and there are a limited number of memberships still available.William I. Koch, who oversees a major mining and fuels company, belongs to Mar-a-Lago, as does the billionaire trader Thomas Peterffy, who spent more than $8 million on political ads in 2012 warning of creeping socialism in America.Bruce Toll, a real estate executive who co-founded Toll Brothers, one of the nation\u2019s largest home builders, and who is still active in the industry, owns a home nearby and frequently sees Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, he said. While they did not discuss any of Mr. Toll\u2019s specific projects, he said, the two would occasionally discuss national issues, such as Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to increase spending on highways and other infrastructure projects.\u201cMaybe you ought to do this or that,\u201d Mr. Toll said of the kind of advice that Mr. Trump got from club members.Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric, in an interview on Friday, rejected suggestions that his family was offering access to his father and profiting from it. First, he said, only 20 to 40 new members are admitted per year, and second, the wealthy business executives who frequent the club, among others, have many ways to communicate with the federal government if they want to.\u201cIt assumes the worst of us and everyone, and that is unfair,\u201d Eric Trump said.Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, said the president had no conflicts of interest, a reference to the fact that federal law exempts him from provisions prohibiting federal employees from taking actions that could benefit themselves financially.\u201cBut regardless, he has not and will not be discussing policy with club members,\u201d she said in a written statement.Mar-a-Lago, she added, is \u201cone of the most successful private clubs in the world,\u201d and it \u201cwas intended to be the Southern White House, and the president looks forward to hosting many world leaders at this remarkable property.\u201d\u201cNo one needs to have a long sit-down with Donald Trump,\u201d said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \u201cIf you can whisper in his ear for 40 seconds, that can be decisive on your policy.\u201dBrad Goldstein, a spokesman for William Koch, said that he did not know whether the two men had ever discussed policy matters. \u201cIf I did know,\u201d Mr. Goldstein added, \u201cthe answer would be that I decline to comment.\u201dHistorically, of course, American presidents have often been rich men with mansions, who sometimes conducted the people\u2019s business in weekend haunts of the wealthy: the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Me., for example, or the Kennedy family home in Hyannisport, Mass.But Mr. Trump\u2019s weekend White House appears to be unprecedented in American history, as it is the first one with customers paying a company owned by the president, several historians said.\u201cMar-a-Lago represents a commercialization of the presidency that has few if any precedents in American history,\u201d said Jon Meacham, a presidential historian and Andrew Jackson biographer. \u201cPresidents have always spent time with the affluent,\u201d he added. \u201cBut a club where people pay you as president to spend time in his company is new. It is kind of amazing.\u201d\u201cMost presidents feel very strongly about the dignity of the office they hold,\u201d Mr. Dean said. \u201cMr. Trump has busted every norm in campaigning, and he seems to be doing the same with the traditions of his office.\u201dLike other members interviewed for this article, Mr. Duberstein said he did not bring up business matters with any Trump administration officials when visiting the club, which also is near a home he owns.\u201cIt is a social thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a business thing.\u201dChristopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime donor to and a friend of the president, said Mr. Trump had always conducted what amounted to informal focus groups on a variety of topics, but that face time with him since the election had become restricted to family and old friends.\u201cIt\u2019s a myth to think that anybody could just join the club and go speak to the president,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said, adding that the Secret Service has instituted a de facto rope line around the president\u2019s table in recent weeks, which several other club members confirmed.But the weekly gatherings at Mar-a-Lago have already drawn some scrutiny from Democrats in the Senate, who called for Mr. Trump to release a list of all of the members.Mar-a-Lago has never been snooty in the manner of some private clubs in Palm Beach; under Mr. Trump, it has long welcomed Jews, gay couples, Republicans and Democrats. (So long as they could afford the entry fee, that is: Mar-a-Lago doubled that fee to $200,000 shortly after Mr. Trump was elected; members also pay $14,000 in annual dues.) Mr. Trump spent years populating his club with people rejected by rival clubs, while also urging his friends to join.Several members said Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on hot-button topics such as immigration \u2014 and in particular his recent move to ban visas for visitors from certain nations \u2014 had caused some friction among the members at Mar-a-Lago. But Bernd Lembcke, the club\u2019s managing director, said that applications had risen since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\u201cIt enhances it \u2014 his presidency does,\u201d Mr. Lembcke said, referring to membership in the club. \u201cPeople are now even more interested in becoming members. But we are very careful in vetting them.\u201d And potential members must be sponsored by a current one, he said. \u201cYou still have to be introduced.\u201dThe list of members is a who\u2019s who of the world of global finance and real estate, but it is also sprinkled with other boldface names, like Howie Carr, the Boston radio show host, and Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots, according to three lists reviewed by The Times, from 2015 through earlier this year.Several members are also major campaign contributors to Mr. Trump, like Mr. Ruddy and Brian Burns, a businessman and lawyer whom Mr. Trump has indicated he now intends to nominate as ambassador to Ireland, records show.One longtime member is Richard LeFrak, a fellow New York developer and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest friends, who in turn has recruited some of his own friends to join. Jeff Greene, a Senate candidate in Florida in 2010, said he had joined at the urging of Mr. LeFrak.But Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Trump\u2019s old New York circle blurs easily into his presidency, is now a place where the president of the United States might seek guidance on a major government project the way another New Yorker might ask around for a good orthopedist.When Mr. LeFrak paid a visit to Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend, he appeared a little startled when Mr. Trump, in a brief interlude during the conversation, told him that the Department of Homeland Security was quoting a price of more than $20 billion for the proposed border wall with Mexico.\u201cHe said, would I consider doing it? And then he suggested that the price that was being quoted in the media seemed absurdly high to him,\u201d Mr. LeFrak said. He is not interested in the work, but said, \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t react to him one way or the other because I don\u2019t know what the facts are.\u201dMr. LeFrak said to the president, \u201cI thought you were going to have homeland security deal with this,\u201d he recalled, describing Mr. Trump as stymied by the bureaucracy. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Yes, maybe General Kelly will call you.\u2019\u201dKitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He did say that he was heading to a store near CLSA\u2019s Midtown Manhattan office to buy boxes for those suddenly let go.The cuts also affected employees in sales and trading, as well as other groups, mostly in New York, and were effective immediately. About 85 employees will remain to run trading in the Americas for clients in the United States and trading and sales for clients in Asia.A spokeswoman for CLSA said that there were \u201ctoo many downward pressures\u201d in stock research and that the company had made a decision to shut it down. Another 150 or so research employees are in Asia and Australia.CLSA Americas, which will continue to be run by Rick Gould as chief executive, is part of a Chinese group that was acquired by Citic Securities, China\u2019s biggest brokerage firm, in 2013 for $1.2 billion in one of the biggest overseas purchases by a Chinese company in finance.In a statement, Mr. Gould said: \u201cSince 2009, CLSA Americas has built an outstanding equity research platform with some of the best analysts on the street. Our focus has always been to provide U.S. and global investors differentiated insights on U.S. stocks.

Our focus now is to continue to provide our clients access to liquidity and best execution.\u201dCitic Securities is partly owned by the Chinese-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Good Fight\u2019 Season 1, Episode 2: Minority Status", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Good FightRespect can often be elusive for black people in professional spaces where their presence is the exception not the rule. Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad offers the black people who work for it the freedom from such denigration. That\u2019s why the opening scene of this episode, in which Maia moves through a front office full of black people of various hues and professional standing, has so much weight. Diane and Maia are causing ripples \u2014 they\u2019re the minority at the firm and are changing its culture in ways that one of the founding partners, Barbara Kolstad (an excellent Erica Tazel), bristles at. This is especially evident when it comes to Diane\u2019s hire of a new assistant, who plays a small but pivotal role in this week\u2019s case.During the regular pro bono advice session the firm gives to union workers as part of its retainer, Maia inadvertently finds a client in Frank (James Martinez). His wages are being garnished by the multibillion dollar company he works for because he falsely confessed to theft. But more interesting than the case itself are the dynamics between the characters, as Diane and Maia settle into their new roles.There is a telling moment early in the episode as the union workers line up to get legal advice from Lucca, Maia and other associates. The number of people in line to see Maia is nearly triple that of anyone else. At first I thought that maybe they recognized her from the front pages. But when the far more experienced Lucca walks over to help it becomes clear that these union workers chose Maia over the black associates for another reason entirely. Throughout \u201cFirst Week,\u201d the writers make subtle nods to how the privilege and race of characters like Maia afford them advantages they aren\u2019t aware of.Look at Marissa Gold (Sarah Steele). A young white woman, at one point, she tells the other applicants (both of whom are black women) with cocky nonchalance: \u201cThere may not even be a job here. Just want to warn you.\u201d Marissa is somehow completely unaware of how that would come across. When Marissa asks Maia about the case she\u2019s working on and then finds more than twenty retail workers that can join the class-action suit, it proves her worth as a potential assistant. Marissa is spunky, whip smart, and dedicated. But she also shares a history with Diane, which gives her a privileged standing the other applicants don\u2019t have.When Barbara sees that Marissa has been hired, she asks Diane if she didn\u2019t like the other applicants. \u201cIt\u2019s just I know Marissa and she\u2019s on the ball,\u201d Diane answers. Barbara grows tense, aware of how Diane is already starting to shift the firm she had a hand in building. It reminds me of Chicago\u2019s problems with segregation and racial dynamics. Watching all this play out is at times painful because of how the writers choose to provide no easy answers.Maia may be too worried about her new career and her splintered family life to notice all this. During the beginning of the case, she ends up going to a seminar about the Friedman method, an interrogation technique that was used against Frank. Lucca thinks the method is bad psychology. But Maia finds herself using it to discern whether her mother, Lenore, lied about the return of her breast cancer in order to see her.In increasingly close-up shots, Maia unsuccessfully studies Lenore\u2019s facial expressions, hoping for a revelation that may never come. \u201cWe were always a boring family,\u201d Maia later says to Amy when they\u2019re in bed at night. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re paying for all those years of happiness.\u201d Maia gets the answers she\u2019s looking for at the end of the episode, but it comes at a painful price.Throughout the first two episodes, Maia\u2019s uncle has been mentioned by both of her parents. He\u2019s the one responsible for the Ponzi scheme, they\u2019ve argued. When Maia goes to Lenore\u2019s home, she finds this uncle moving through the home in a way that indicates an unexpected intimacy. This suggests that not only has Lenore been cheating on Henry, but that she may also be a key reason for his downfall.It\u2019s a bombshell moment that would land with more force if Maia were a compelling lead character. \u201cFirst Week\u201d does make you feel for her, though. She\u2019s becoming a convenient target for scorn by the various people undone by the Ponzi scheme. The voice mail messages and texts are cruel, homophobic and increasingly disturbing. She\u2019s also a brand new associate who has yet to find her footing. But she\u2019s blind to the culture she has stepped into, which is where \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d might find its most interesting stories.Other Gossip\u2022 The animosity between Lucca and Andrea Stevens (Christine Lahti), is cleverly constructed. They hide their insults by asking seemingly innocent questions and employing compliments and strained smiles that can easily be mistaken for grimaces. These scenes also demonstrate how deft \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d is at balancing various forms of subtext in even passing exchanges.\u2022 It\u2019s very uncomfortable to watch the callous indifference of the (white) litigation finance team that funds Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad\u2019s cases. The team decides to go forward with the class action suit, which means that Frank might not get a penny, depending out the outcome. That\u2019s exactly what happens because of last minute evidence that casts doubt on his testimony.\u2022 Given Lucca\u2019s anger over how the finance team made this decision instead of the client it\u2019s meant to serve, I\u2019m curious how she\u2019ll continue to wrestle with the sometimes morally compromised nature of being a successful lawyer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Takes In a Broadway Show, but Shuns the Spotlight", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBarack Obama has kept a relatively low profile since leaving office last month, and he largely avoided the spotlight on Friday night \u2014 at least as much as a former president can when he is attending a Broadway show.Shortly after the lights went down at the American Airlines Theater on West 42nd Street, there was a blur, and the brief shining of a flashlight. Three people quickly took their seats several rows back from the stage: Mr. Obama; his eldest daughter, Malia; and Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior adviser to the president.A woman sitting nearby let out a small yelp, but most of the audience at the revival of Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Price\u2019\u2019 did not realize they were watching a Broadway show with someone who was, until recently, the most powerful person in the world. The play, starring Mark Ruffalo, Danny DeVito, Jessica Hecht and Tony Shalhoub, centers on two estranged brothers and their quest to reconnect.\u201cWell, I actually didn\u2019t know he was sitting in the row,\u201d said Laralyn Mowers, 37, who lives in Astoria, Queens. She was sitting five seats to the right of Mr. Obama and did not realize he was there until a friend told her at intermission. \u201cI had a really bad day and it all just changed.\u201dMs. Mowers said she was actually irritated when the trio first came in. \u201cWho is so rude to come in after the show starts with the flashlights and everything?\u201d she said.Mr. Obama wore glasses during the show. At one point during the second act, he and his daughter sat in identical poses: right hands pressed to their chins while intently observing the drama before them. Just before intermission, again in darkness, Mr. Obama, his daughter and Ms. Jarrett were whisked backstage to greet the cast and to take pictures with the crew. Once more, most of the crowd was oblivious to his presence.After the play ended, the Obamas and Ms. Jarrett joined the crowd in a standing ovation for the cast, the most visible they had been all night. Minutes later, they were gone. The audience members who managed to see the former president were heard expressing surprise that he had been there.Of course, Mr. Obama is not alone among politicians who attend Broadway shows.During Friday\u2019s performance of \u201cThe Price,\u201d a line from Mr. DeVito\u2019s character, a furniture dealer, about the federal government being unreliable drew the biggest laugh of the night.

{"Headline": "The Major Blind Spots in Macroeconomics", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyThere was an unusual degree of consensus among economists about what would happen if Britain voted for Brexit in the referendum on June 23 last year. The language used by the International Monetary Fund was typical: It expressed fears of an \u201cabrupt reaction,\u201d adding that this \u201cmay have already begun.\u201d The head of the organization, Christine Lagarde, said that the consequences of Brexit would range from \u201cpretty bad to very, very bad.\u201d The Bank of England warned of a recession, a contraction in gross domestic product and an increase in unemployment. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development published a paper called \u201cThe Economic Consequences of Brexit,\u201d predicting a \u201cmajor negative shock to the U.K. economy.\u201d Even pro-Brexit economists expected an immediate downturn: Gerard Lyons, former economic adviser to the prominent Brexiter Boris Johnson, said that the trajectory would resemble the \u201cNike swoosh\u201d \u2014 down then up.What happened instead was that Britain enjoyed the best growth of any major advanced economy in 2016. The doomsayers have been quick to point out that Brexit hasn\u2019t actually happened yet, so all the promised shock has been postponed rather than averted \u2014 which, for the record, is what I think, too. Still, it\u2019s all a bit embarrassing for everyone who made those overconfident forecasts. Andy Haldane, the chief economist for the Bank of England, which was one of the sources of those doomy prognostications, agrees. He compared the pitfalls of economic prediction to the single most famously wrong weather forecast in British history, made on the BBC on Oct. 15, 1987. A woman had called the BBC to say she was worried there was a hurricane on the way. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there isn\u2019t,\u201d the weatherman responded. That night, 22 people died amid hurricane-force winds.This isn\u2019t the first time Haldane has been critical of the current state of macroeconomics \u2014 that\u2019s the big-picture, whole-economy side of the profession. Last fall he gave an important, broad-ranging speech with the elegant title \u201cThe Dappled World,\u201d in which he argued that the unexpected global downturn that began in late 2007 has left behind \u201ca crisis in the economics and finance profession.\u201d Economic forecasts on the eve of the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, he says, \u201cnot just wrong but spectacularly so.\u201d The overall trajectory of precrisis forecasts was upward; the reality was a brutally deep capital V.The reason this poses a deep intellectual crisis for macroeconomics is that the entire point of the field, as it has developed since the work of John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, is to prevent just this sort of severe downturn. Keynes once spoke of a future in which economists would be \u201chumble, competent people on a level with dentists,\u201d while the brilliant up-and-coming French economist Esther Duflo recently gave an admired I.M.F. lecture called \u201cThe Economist as Plumber.\u201d It seems to me, though, that what macroeconomists do is really most like bomb disposal. Uniquely in the social sciences and humanities, macroeconomics was developed with a specific, real-world purpose, and a negative purpose to boot: to stop anything like the Great Depression from ever happening again. Given this goal \u2014 to avert systemic crises and downturns \u2014 the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, for macroeconomics, an intellectual disaster.In retrospect, the failure of the discipline to predict and prevent the crisis was based on deep conceptual faults. One of these concerned a mysterious refusal to engage with the role of the banking and finance system in the economy. Another was the assumption that the discipline makes about individual motivations, assuming that individuals \u201coptimize\u201d their decision-making to behave, in economic terms, rationally. This is a convenient intellectual shortcut for building models, but it is also a fiction, as we know not just from our own human experience but even from within economics itself, where microeconomics has recently made exciting progress in the study of human irrationality, bias and cognitive error. It is a matter of provable fact that our decision-making is not entirely rational. Economic models built on the premise of our rationality will always have a creaky underpinning.The focus of Haldane\u2019s speech is on this second point. He talks about the need for macroeconomics to learn from other disciplines in both the natural and social sciences in order to seek \u201ca different perspective on individual behavior and systemwide dynamics.\u201d He argues that the profession has \u201cborrowed too little from other disciplines\u201d and become \u201ca methodological monoculture,\u201d with the associated risk that everybody in the field can be wrong in the same way and at the same time. He finds compelling evidence in a survey of American professors of social science, who were asked whether \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d knowledge was better than knowledge \u201cobtained by a single discipline.\u201d Most social scientists sensibly thought that the answer was yes, by overwhelming margins. But 57 percent of economists disagreed or strongly disagreed. Economists literally think they have nothing to learn from anyone else. The field also suffers from its rigid hierarchies and its lack of gender and racial diversity. As Haldane puts it, \u201cIt is difficult to escape the conclusion that economics remains an insular, self-referential discipline.\u201dHaldane\u2019s proposed solution to the problem lies in an emerging new field called agent-based modeling, in which large amounts of computer power are used to build models where individual actors have their own motives and their own agency. These agents collide and overlap and interact and generate predictions through a messy process more akin to real life than the clean models of old-fashioned macroeconomics. Agent-based modeling has been shown to have promise in other fields, especially physics \u2014 and also in modeling real-world problems like the tendency for Brazil nuts to levitate toward the top of the mixed-nut package. (That might sound kooky, but Haldane points out that the nut research \u201chas since found real-world applications in industries such as pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.\u201d)Haldane isn\u2019t the only prominent nonacademic economist to think there are profound problems in macroeconomics. Paul Romer is a highly regarded macroeconomist who recently became chief economist at the World Bank. (It was Romer who is credited with having coined, in 2004, the famous slogan that \u201ca crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\u201d) Last winter he, too, issued a lacerating critique of his field, titled \u201cThe Trouble With Macroeconomics.\u201d His argument focuses on the question of \u201cidentification,\u201d which is shorthand in the field for how economists identify the cause of an event. Identification is a huge deal for economics, because if you can\u2019t tell if x, y or z caused something, you don\u2019t know which of those variables to study or measure or change. The omission of finance and the role of money from economic models is the biggest weakness in the field, Romer believes. It is hard for noneconomists to get our heads around the fact that the dominant macroeconomic models (including the ones used by central banks) made no allowance for how money works \u2014 especially not for fluctuations in how much of it is around. Such an oversight seems weird, and entirely counterintuitive. But that\u2019s what happened, and it played a big role in macroeconomists\u2019 ability to, as Romer puts it, \u201cdismiss mere facts.\u201dThe Bank of England and the World Bank are two of the most important noncommercial banks in the world. It is striking, and exhilarating and scary too, that the chief economists of these two institutions each thinks that their trade is in crisis. Not so long ago, leading macroeconomists thought that the main part of their work was basically over. The Nobel winner Robert Lucas claimed as much in his presidential address to the American Economic Association in 2003. Macroeconomics, he said, \u201chas succeeded: Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved.\u201d That now looks wildly hubristic. Maybe the field is roughly where physics was at the end of the 19th century, when some scientists thought that their own field\u2019s main problems had been solved, within a Newtonian framework that is now known to be inadequate to describe reality. Maybe, like physics in the 20th century, macroeconomics is about to have a heroic period. If it does, it will begin in the work of people like Romer and Haldane, who are unflinchingly willing to talk about its huge recent failures. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.John Lanchester has written eight books, including the novel \u201cCapital\u201d and, most recently, \u201cHow to Speak Money: What the Money People Say \u2014 and What It Really Means.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Picks Wall Street Over Main Street", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPresident Trump fired the first round in his war against financial regulations by signing two executive orders on Friday.Though they don\u2019t do too much by themselves to roll back these reforms, the directives do offer important details on how Mr. Trump will approach the financial industry in the next four years \u2014 and provide three reasons that people on Main Street should be scared about how Mr. Trump will help Wall Street.The first is that President Trump, contrary to the hopes of many, has no intention of getting tough with finance. During the election campaign, Mr. Trump benefited from not having a political record. Though he was clear on repealing the Dodd-Frank law, many people believed that he would take alternative actions to strengthen financial regulation. Reinstating a modern Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that separated commercial banking from investment banking \u2014 a reinstatement championed by, among others, Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 was part of the Republican platform, and Mr. Trump talked about the unfairness of hedge-fund salaries.That this is how he starts his tenure should confirm that Mr. Trump has no intention of taking on Wall Street. For people who follow these issues, this was noticeable during the campaign and transition, and Friday\u2019s action will make it crystal clear for everyone else. His first executive order in the area of finance and Wall Street could have focused on anything, but there\u2019s nothing in his orders that indicates, in any way, that he wants to take on financial reform more aggressively than President Barack Obama did (or than Hillary Clinton would have).The executive order mentions worries about the international competitiveness of our banks, but nothing about whether there\u2019s sufficient checks against fraud and corruption. It takes the time to admonish regulators, but shows no dismay about the size, concentration or power of Wall Street.People hoping Mr. Trump would upset, rather than restore, global financial capitalism are in for a rude awakening.Third, rather than meet with regulators, small businesses or community banks, Mr. Trump met with the titans of Wall Street before announcing the directives.For all the talk of the \u201cforgotten man,\u201d conservatives and Mr. Trump will approach attacking Dodd-Frank as a straightforward list of priorities from the most powerful heights of the financial industry. That the fiduciary rule, rather than any of the other things Dodd-Frank does, is President Trump\u2019s first target demonstrates that the administration is giving priority to the donor class, which has obsessed about the rule for years.With the help of Dodd-Frank, there\u2019s been significant progress made toward ensuring that a systemically risky financial institution can be wound down. Mr. Trump could have taken actions to push reform further.It\u2019s clear with his orders that he won\u2019t take that choice.Mike Konczal is a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute.Advertisement"}

The Democrats on the committee twice boycotted a vote on his confirmation, leading Republicans to breach protocol and push Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s vote to the full Senate on their own.Just one Democrat, Senator of Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broke with his party and supported Mr. Mnuchin. In a sign of the backlash that Democrats will face for siding with any part of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee warned that Mr. Manchin\u2019s vote would not go unnoticed.\u201cWe will ensure that Joe Manchin hears from his West Virginia constituents who disapprove of his voting with Wall Street against working families,\u201d the group said in a statement after the vote.For Republicans, the resistance was chalked up to political theater.On Monday, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, accused Democrats of making Mr. Mnuchin a political pawn and described their concerns as a stall tactic.\u201cUnder any objective standard, Mr. Mnuchin has ample experience, credentials and qualifications for this important position,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cMy colleagues have done all they can under the rules \u2014 even to the point of casting aside some longstanding customs and traditions of the Senate \u2014 in order to delay his confirmation.\u201dWhile Mr. Mnuchin struggled to show fluency with some aspects of the job during his confirmation hearing, Republicans and Democrats generally agreed that he was well versed on economic issues. He also struck a more moderate tone than Mr. Trump on issues such as trade and dealing with China. And Mr. Mnuchin left some experts dumbfounded after suggesting that \u201cthere would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class\u201d \u2014 a promise that appears to be at odds with plans presented by Mr. Trump and House Republicans.Mr. Mnuchin was not the only member of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet to be confirmed on Monday night. The Senate also voted in favor of David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. A holdover from the Obama administration, Dr. Shulkin is currently the department\u2019s under secretary of health and was approved by a unanimous vote.Things could become more complicated on Thursday, however, when Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for labor secretary, faces a committee hearing. Several Republicans on the committee have declined to support Mr. Puzder, a fast-food chain executive who critics say promotes policies that are harmful to workers.Advertisement"}

Trained as a civil engineer, he got his start in business from his father, who had a successful construction company. He shifted the focus of his father\u2019s company to real estate and then turned his eye to luxury goods. Through his Groupe Arnault, the silver-haired Parisian sits at the helm of the luxury goods companies Christian Dior and LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. He is also a major art collector, having acquired works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol.His vast wealth sits predominantly in companies he controls. He has $34.8 billion held among Christian Dior, LVMH and Carrefour, a French retail chain. The next largest distribution is in cash at $2.9 billion; this is money from salaries, dividends and holdings that give him liquidity when he needs it. Then come the homes. He has a mansion in Paris worth $55 million and a home in the Bahamas worth $30 million, as well as yachts and art. His wealth shows how a single concentrated position in a company can increase your worth tremendously.Steven A. Ballmer, 60, scored a perfect 800 on the mathematics portion of the SAT and punched his ticket from an elite private school in Detroit to Harvard University. In his sophomore year, he lived in the same dorm as Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft. In 1980, he dropped out of Stanford University\u2019s business school to start working for Mr. Gates. He was paid $50,000 but given a stake in the nascent company. He rose to become chief executive in 2000 \u2014 a post he held for nearly 14 years. Shortly after stepping down, he bought the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team for a record $2 billion. The team had been mired in controversy with a previous owner, Donald Sterling.Even though Mr. Ballmer left Microsoft, the vast bulk of his wealth remains in company stock \u2014 $21.4 billion. He has $7.3 billion more in cash. It makes his stake in the Clippers seems paltry. He also has $450 million in Twitter shares. He owns a $14 million home in Hunts Point, Wash., and properties on Whidbey Island worth about $4 million.Susanne Klatten, 54, the richest woman in Germany, can trace the source of her wealth to \u201cthe ultimate driving machine,\u201d BMW. Her grandfather founded an industrial conglomerate that owned the German automotive company \u2014 and had a stake in its more staid rival, Daimler-Benz. The company also owned the chemical giant Altana. Her father, Herbert Quandt, took over the family businesses when his father died in 1954. When he died in 1982, Ms. Klatten received stakes in BMW and Altana, of which she is now the sole owner. As her father was credited with saving BMW from bankruptcy, she is credited with making Altana a top company in Germany. She is also chairwoman of the SGL Group, which produces graphite and carbon-fiber products.Her wealth is tied up in her companies, with over half, or $12.1 billion, in the BMW Group. An additional 16 percent is in Altana, and 1 percent is in the SGL Group. She has 22.5 percent in cash. She has a family office that creates privacy around the breakdown of her wealth.Azim Premji, 71, was born into the family that started Western India Vegetable Products, which produced hydrogenated oils. When Mr. Premji was at Stanford University, his father, who started the company, died, and he left college to take it over. At 23, he became chief executive. He diversified the Mumbai-based company\u2019s offerings into soap and baby care products. In 1981, he ventured into information technology. The company boomed through the 1980s and \u201990s, and in 2000 the renamed Wipro went public in New York. In 2009, Mr. Premji handed over the day-to-day running of the company. He devotes time to philanthropy, having given half his Wipro shares to a charity that supports education and health causes in India.His wealth appears to remain fairly concentrated, with 64 percent of it in Wipro shares. An additional 13 percent is in a related company, Wipro Enterprises, and 20 percent is shielded by his family office. Public records show that he has a $20 million stake in JM Financial (about 0.2 percent of his wealth), $180 million in cash and $1 million in property in Mumbai. Given his total worth, his properties and holdings are probably much greater, but he has structured his wealth to protect his privacy.Carlos Alberto Sicupira, who turns 69 this year, hails from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, which ranks just behind New York City (where he keeps a residence) for the most billionaires in the Americas. He began his career in finance at Banco de Investimentos Garantia. He later served as chief executive of Lojas Americanas, a Brazilian shopping chain. He is a founder of 3G Capital, a private equity firm that has become known in recent years for partnering with Warren E. Buffett, the second-wealthiest man in the world, on deals like the acquisition of Heinz in 2013 and, two years later, its merger with Kraft.Much of Mr. Sicupira\u2019s wealth rests in a series of deals 3G did with breweries starting in 1999. He has a $5.8 billion stake in the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev, which accounts for nearly 67 percent of his wealth. He has nearly $1 billion more in 3G itself. He still holds a $220 million stake in Lojas Americanas, where he remains chairman.

Her father, Ted Arison, started Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. In 1990, he moved back to Tel Aviv, where he was born, and established Arison Investments. It later acquired Bank Hapoalim, Israel\u2019s largest bank, and renamed itself the Arison Group. It has investments in finance, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and water. When her father died in 1999, Ms. Arison inherited 35 percent of his wealth. (She has a brother, Micky, who owns the Miami Heat basketball team.) As owner of the Arison Group and a philanthropist, she promotes good deeds. The investment group\u2019s motto is \u201cDoing good is good for business,\u201d and through her charity she has sponsored Good Deeds Day, which encourages people to volunteer.Ms. Arison\u2019s wealth is divided fairly evenly among different investments. She owns $1.6 billion of stock in Carnival Cruise Line, $1.6 billion of stock in Bank Hapoalim, $1.1 billion in the Arison Group itself and holds $1 billion in cash. She has a stake in an Israeli housing and infrastructure company and homes in the Bal Harbour section of Miami and in Tel Aviv.Ever worn Nike, Adidas, Puma or Uniqlo? Those items may have come from one of Ma Jianrong\u2019s factories. His company is the leading textile manufacturer in China. Mr. Ma, 52, began working in the textile industry as a teenager and later earned a master\u2019s degree from Zhejiang University of Technology. His father, Ma Baoxing, was chairman of the weaving company that became Shenzhou International Group Holdings. In the late 1990s, the younger Mr. Ma took over the company and increased its revenue and net profit by 23 times in seven years. A member of the Chinese Communist Party, he is an official in the Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Congress.The exact composition of his wealth is hard to determine. He seems to have about $340 million in cash, with the rest in Shenzhou International Group Holdings.Patrice Motsepe, 55, was born in Johannesburg and began his career as a lawyer with American firms in South Africa. He attended university and law school during the apartheid era and practiced law for six years, becoming the first black partner in a South African law firm. In 1994, after Nelson Mandela became the country\u2019s first black president, Mr. Motsepe quit law to start Future Mining, a mining services company. With that as his start, he began acquiring mines and other mining companies. By 2004, the accumulated entities became African Rainbow Minerals. He owns the Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club, a soccer team in South Africa\u2019s premier league, and last year he started a private equity firm and financial services company.His wealth, which places him among South Africa\u2019s richest people, is well diversified. The largest portion of his wealth, 36 percent, is in cash and its equivalents. He has nearly 30 percent in Africa Rainbow Minerals, and a similar amount in Sanlam, a financial services firm of which he is deputy chairman. Some 5 percent of his wealth is in the Harmony Gold Mining Company. Two homes are worth $7 million, or one-third of 1 percent of his wealth.In search of quick Chinese food? Panda Express, with its 1,900 locations around the United States, is there to serve some up. Peggy Cherng, 69, founded the chain with her husband, Andrew. When the restaurant began expanding from Glendale, Calif., into the full-fledged chain it is today, she used her science background to make the business tech-savvy early on and then applied her knowledge of logistics to streamline the process. Ms. Cherng, who was born in Myanmar (then Burma), was raised in Hong Kong and met her husband at Baker University in Kansas. She holds a master\u2019s degree in computer science and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, and began her career at the defense contractor McDonnell Douglas. She and her husband live in California.Her largest holding is in the Panda Restaurant Group, which also owns Panda Inn. It is worth $1.2 billion, or 77 percent of her wealth.

{"Headline": "Greeks Turn to the Black Market as Another Bailout Showdown Looms", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 During seven years of a grinding economic crisis, Dimitri Tsamopoulos has lost at least half the clients from his once bustling tax consultancy. But in the past few months, business has jumped, not because the Greek economy is finally recovering but because it is falling even deeper into the abyss.\u201cMost of these people will keep working,\u201d Mr. Tsamopoulos said, arching an eyebrow from behind his desk as clients waited in a smoky room outside. \u201cBut now, they\u2019ll do it on the black market. They\u2019re saying they need a way to survive.\u201dAs of last month, unpaid taxes in Greece had soared to 95 billion euros, up from \u20ac76 billion two years ago. Most of that is considered uncollectable.\u201cThe heart of the matter for an ever-rising number of citizens and businesses is that they simply do not have the financial resources anymore to meet their rising tax obligations,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economist and a member of a team of European Union specialists that helped supervise the country\u2019s earlier bailouts.Short on alternatives, he said, \u201cmany are falling back into the gray economy.\u201dShutting down this gray economy is a priority for Greece\u2019s creditors, even as the two sides are bracing for another showdown, with Athens and its creditors arguing over the latest bailout, worth \u20ac86 billion. Greece is aiming to strike a deal with creditors by Monday, when European finance ministers meet in Brussels to assess if Athens has done enough in overhauling the economy \u2014 and combatting tax evasion \u2014 to unlock bailout funds.Blended into that equation is a standoff between the International Monetary Fund and European countries over how much more austerity to require of Greece. The I.M.F. wants European creditors to further reduce Greece\u2019s mountainous debt, now at 180 percent of economic output, warning that it will spiral out of control otherwise.An essential piece of Greece\u2019s recovery plan has been to collect more taxes from a population that has long engaged in tax evasion. An independent tax authority was created and auditors were hired, helping to pull in about \u20ac5 billion more in revenue than expected last year. But businesses and individuals say they have less to give for taxes that keep rising, and a growing incentive to avoid paying.Unemployment remains about 23 percent, and for some people the shadow economy is a lifeline. Others see it as a way to prevent a government they don\u2019t trust from putting their money into a black hole, which is the national debt.Electricians, plumbers, hairdressers, journalists, computer consultants and a variety of other self-employed workers have all taken the plunge. On a recent afternoon, Yiannis, a young television production designer, stood in line in a government office to de-register as a consultant. Had he not, he said, his take-home pay this year would amount to just 30 percent of earnings.\u201cIt\u2019s like they force you to become illegal,\u201d said Yiannis, who, like many people, refused to give his full name for fear of attracting the tax authorities. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to work on the black market. I need to make ends meet.\u201dYiannis said he had also registered a company in Bulgaria, where the business tax rate is 10 percent, so that he could keep issuing receipts for freelance work. Tens of thousands of Greeks have been registering companies in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Luxembourg and other low-tax countries to avoid paying the higher tax bills at home \u2014 which means less revenue for Greece\u2019s coffers and creates unfair competition for tax-paying entrepreneurs who could potentially play a bigger role in the revival of Greece\u2019s economy.When he bid on a contract to fireproof a new building, another firm offered to work off the books for half his rate. Mr. Ladas won the job because he provided insurance that the competitor could not. But he had to lower his price, sapping revenue that he wanted to reinvest in the business. More income was lost when clients bought his equipment and hired off-the-book electricians for the installation.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to be responsible,\u201d said Mr. Ladas, who wants to build a future in Greece rather than leave, as his friends have done. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to compete against others who don\u2019t pay the same tax as you.\u201dThe revenue that he does earn is steadily being eaten away. When he opened, he kept around 60 percent of his profit, after taxes. Today, his take is about 30 percent, after tax increases approved by the Greek government to meet budget-cutting and revenue targets imposed by creditors.\u201cThose who play by the rules are the ones getting punished,\u201d Mr. Ladas said.Even electricians, in a profession rife with shadow economy workers, complain about the competition. In a brightly lit office in central Athens, members of the national electricians union huddled around a table one evening to discuss their plight.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting against people who don\u2019t pay taxes,\u201d said Emmanouil Kafkalas, the general secretary, adding that at least half of electricians worked in the shadow economy. \u201cWe\u2019re losing work because they can charge less.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified Periklis Ladas. He is the man on the left, not the right.An article on Feb. 19 about the growth of a shadow economy in Greece misstated the day that European finance ministers were to meet in Brussels to discuss the latest Greek bailout package. The session began Monday, Feb. 20 \u2014 not Tuesday, Feb. 21.Pavlos Zafiropoulos and Anna Psaroudakis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Deforestation, Once Tamed, Comes Roaring Back", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "A decade after the \u201cSave the Rainforest\u201d movement captured the world\u2019s imagination, Cargill and other food giants are pushing deeper into the wilderness.Supported byCOLONIA BERLIN, Bolivia \u2014 A few months ago, a representative from Cargill traveled to this remote colony in Bolivia\u2019s eastern lowlands in the southernmost reaches of the vast Amazon River basin with an enticing offer.One of those farmers, Heinrich Janzen, was clearing woodland from a 37-acre plot he bought late last year, hustling to get soy in the ground in time for a May harvest. \u201cCargill wants to buy from us,\u201d said Mr. Janzen, 38, as bluish smoke drifted from heaps of smoldering vegetation.His soy is in demand. Cargill is one of several agricultural traders vying to buy from soy farmers in the region, he said.Cargill confirmed the accounts of colony residents, and said the company was still assessing whether it would source from the community. That decision would depend on a study of the area\u2019s productivity and land titles, said Hugo Krajnc, Cargill\u2019s corporate affairs leader for the Southern Cone, based in Argentina. \u201cBut if a farmer has burned down its forest we\u2019ll not source from that grower,\u201d he said.A decade after the \u201cSave the Rainforest\u201d movement forced changes that dramatically slowed deforestation across the Amazon basin, activity is roaring back in some of the biggest expanses of forests in the world. That resurgence, driven by the world\u2019s growing appetite for soy and other agricultural crops, is raising the specter of a backward slide in efforts to preserve biodiversity and fight climate change.Here across the border in Bolivia, where there are fewer restrictions on land clearance, deforestation appears to be accelerating as well.Now, a new study by an environmental advocacy group points to fresh indications of large-scale forest-clearing by Bolivian and Brazilian farmers who trade soybeans with Cargill.That organization, Washington-based Mighty Earth, used satellite imaging and supply-chain mapping information from the Stockholm Environment Institute, an environmental think tank, to identify deforestation in Brazil where two American-based food giants, Cargill and Bunge, are the only known agricultural traders. The supply-chain mapping by the environmental institute uses customs, shipment and storage data, as well as production data from Brazilian municipalities to trace agricultural exports back to producers.In Bolivia, where supply-chain mapping is not available, Mighty Earth sent employees to areas where Cargill operates. The organization used drones to record the clearing of forests and savannas in areas where Cargill operates silos.The study was funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation and a nongovernmental organization, Rainforest Foundation Norway.A reporter for The New York Times independently traveled to remote areas of Bolivia described in the environmentalists\u2019 report and interviewed farmers engaged in deforestation who said they sold soy to Cargill. The farmers described what they called Cargill\u2019s push to increase its purchases of locally produced soy and its attempts to enhance bonds with local producers.Both Cargill and Bunge said the report seemed to inflate its role in the region\u2019s deforestation. Cargill\u2019s share of soy in the Bolivia municipalities in which it operates came to about 8 percent, Cargill said. Meanwhile, in Brazil\u2019s Matopiba region, Bunge\u2019s share was about 20 percent, the company said.And soy is just one crop behind deforestation, said Stewart Lindsay, Bunge\u2019s vice president for global corporate affairs.\u201cOne company alone cannot solve this issue,\u201d Mr. Lindsay said. \u201cA positive step would be for more companies to adopt zero deforestation commitments, apply controls to block crops grown in illegally cleared areas from entering their supply chains, report publicly on progress and invest millions of dollars to support sustainable land use planning efforts, all of which Bunge has done.\u201d (Bunge, however, is not a signatory to the New York Declaration of Forests.)In an interview, Cargill chief executive David MacLennan said the company was studying the allegations of deforestation in Bolivia and Brazil linked to the company. \u201cIf there\u2019s something there, if it\u2019s substantiated, we\u2019ll do something about it,\u201d Mr. MacLennan said. \u201cIf that\u2019s accurate, it\u2019s not acceptable.\u201cWe\u2019re going to honor our obligations and our commitments,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve committed to ending deforestation and to do our part in ending deforestation. Our word is our bond.\u201dOnly about 15 percent of the world\u2019s forest cover remains intact, according to the World Resources Institute. The rest has been cleared, degraded or is in fragments, wiping out ecosystems and displacing indigenous communities, scientists say.Behind the rise in deforestation is a strategy by multinational food companies to source their agricultural commodities from ever more remote areas around the world. These areas tend to be where legal protections of forests are weakest.The uptick in forest loss since then, however, has raised concerns that the progress is far from secure.Brazil was aware of the challenge of keeping deforestation at bay, Everton Lucero, the secretary of climate change and forests of Brazil\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, said in an interview.\u201cWe are very uncomfortable with the bad news that we had a rise in deforestation, and we are taking every possible measure to reverse it next year,\u201d Mr. Lucero said. Budget shortfalls amid Brazil\u2019s recent economic and political turmoil, he said, had wreaked havoc with its policing of its rain forests.When traveling to remote regions, \u201cSometimes our command and control units were without fuel for helicopters,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we are on a recovery path.\u201dBolivia, on the other hand, presents a different situation. President Evo Morales, a socialist, has made securing \u201cfood sovereignty\u201d a major part of his agenda, driving Bolivia\u2019s agricultural expansion. There are relatively few forest protections, and the government\u2019s Forestry and Land Authority is tasked with the potentially conflicting roles of regulating land use, forestry and agriculture, and issuing concessions for logging and farming. The landlocked country has declared that it expects to clear almost 14 million more acres of forest by 2025, to convert into farmland.A major culprit is the cultivation of soy, which has jumped more than 500 percent in Bolivia since 1991, to 3.8 million hectares in 2013, according to the most recent agricultural censuses. Little of that soy is consumed domestically. The vast majority is processed and exported as animal feed in a commodities trade that serves a global appetite for hamburgers, chicken and pork.\u201cThe forest is seen as useless land that needs to be made useful,\u201d said Nataly Ascarrunz, executive director of the Bolivian Institute of Forestry Investigation, a Bolivian nongovernmental organization that monitors and researches the country\u2019s forests.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure for economic development,\u201d Ms. Ascarrunz said. \u201cWhen resources are flowing, production is happening and people have work. It\u2019s very hard to argue with that.\u201dVictor Yucra, the director general of Bolivia\u2019s forest and land management at the Forestry and Land Authority, stressed the need for the Bolivian government to balance the protection of its forests with the needs of its agricultural sector.\u201cOur concern is in ensuring that intensive agricultural production takes place within a framework that also provides for sustainable forestry and protection for standing forests,\u201d Mr. Yucra said.Mr. MacLennan, the chief executive of Cargill, described a business trip to Brazil last year, during which he saw the Amazon from a plane window. \u201cYou look down and you see this beautiful forest,\u201d he said. \u201cKilometers and kilometers of forest. But you also see these big chunks of dirt.\u201cThe brown really contrasts with the green,\u201d he continued, comparing the forest and deforested areas. \u201cWhen you see it, it\u2019s like, \u2018Holy cow. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\u2019 It just hit me when I saw it in broad daylight \u2014 the impact the deforestation has.\u201dMr. MacLennan initially garnered praise among environmentalists for pledging to extend the no-deforestation pledge it had made regarding palm oil to cover every commodity the company handles. Cargill\u2019s commitment was called one of the most sweeping environmental pledges ever made by a large agricultural company. It earned Mr. MacLennan a photo opportunity with Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general at the time.Even before the New York Declaration, Cargill had made significant efforts to buy palm oil sourced only from land not linked to fresh deforestation, according to a supply-chain expert with extensive experience working on Cargill\u2019s global sustainability efforts. The expert spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying that to do so openly would jeopardize professional relations with the company.Cargill continued to invest millions of dollars adding extra staff members and hiring third-party auditors to verify that the palm oil was coming from established fields, not farmland freshly carved from the forest, he said. But Cargill has been less aggressive with other commodities, he said.Part of the issue was Cargill\u2019s decentralized setup, the expert said. Another problem was the resistance from commodities traders, whose incentive is to seek supplies from as many sources as possible in order to drive down costs. Buying only sustainably grown commodities would mean a more limited supply.Now, environmental groups accuse Cargill of backtracking on its 2020 deadline. In recent statements, Cargill has adopted a 2030 deadline for elimination of deforestation from its supply chain \u2014 a separate deadline, mentioned elsewhere in the New York Declaration, that was meant to apply to ending all forms of deforestation, not just those related to agricultural commodities.\u201cThey\u2019re willfully misinterpreting the Declaration,\u201d said Glenn Hurowitz, chief executive of Mighty Earth. \u201cThey\u2019re breaking their own pledge.\u201dCargill is committed, Mr. MacLennan said, to eliminating by 2020 deforestation from its production of palm oil, a commodity widely used in food, detergents and cosmetics. But, he said, Cargill had always understood the declaration to give all signatories until 2030 to tackle deforestation.\u201cI don\u2019t think I or others appreciated the vast complexity of the task,\u201d Mr. MacLennan said. \u201cLet\u2019s say that we are trading or buying and selling soybean meal. Where did the soybeans come from? And did they come from deforested land? Maybe we weren\u2019t buying the soybeans directly. I don\u2019t know.\u201dHolly Gibbs, an expert in tropical deforestation and agriculture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, called the 2030 deadline interpretation devastating. \u201cIf we were to wait until 2030,\u201d Ms. Gibbs said, \u201cthere would be no forest left.\u201dIn Mr. Janzen\u2019s newly cleared field, a long strip of land flanked by vivid vegetation, blue-white smoke drifted from a smoldering landscape.The German-speaking Mennonites, who live amid horse-drawn buggies and farmhouses that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in rural Ohio or Pennsylvania, trace their origins to 16th-century Protestant reformists who migrated to Russia, the United States, Canada, Belize and Mexico in search of farming opportunities and religious freedom. Some moved to Bolivia in the last century, and about 57,000 Mennonites now live in 55 secluded settlements here, eschewing some aspects of 21st century technology, like modern cars, but enthusiastically embracing others, such as tractors and genetically modified seeds.Their trade with companies like Cargill has transformed their communities into a bloc of relatively prosperous landowners. But in recent years, they have also been targeted by land reforms enacted by Mr. Morales, who has pledged to reverse the centuries of subjugation of Bolivia\u2019s indigenous majority.The farmer, Mr. Janzen, with the help of two laborers, spent the day digging roots from the earth, between smoking woodpiles. There was a brown jumble of slender trees, saplings, shrubs, bushes, vines and roots. Occasional larger trees showed gashes where the bulldozer first made contact, pushing them to the ground.Farther downfield lay more long, neat cordons of debris, waiting to be burned. \u201cIf the rain holds off, I\u2019ll burn the rest tomorrow,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Want You in a Health Savings Account. So Now What?", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIf you\u2019ve been watching the debate in Washington over what is to become of our health insurance plans, you know that Republicans already disagree on a whole bunch of things. They\u2019re not sure about what any new plan will cost. They\u2019re not sure how any new tax credits should work or who should get them. They\u2019re not sure about how Medicaid should operate.But there\u2019s one thing they do know for sure: They want a whole lot more of us to have health savings accounts.There\u2019s a great deal to like about these accounts, which you can open and contribute to only if you are enrolled in a health insurance plan that has a pretty high deductible. They offer a rare triple threat to the tax man: You get a tax break on the money that goes in. You pay no taxes on the money as it grows, potentially over decades. Finally, you pay no taxes when the money comes out, as long as you use it on a long list of health expenditures.Seems like magic, right? Well, it works nicely just as long as you can afford to save in the first place and as long as you don\u2019t skimp on necessary care to keep your account balance high. A high balance doesn\u2019t help if you die because you did not want to spend your H.S.A. money to have a doctor check a mysterious lump.For the lucky among us with at least a bit of money to spare, however, the biggest problem with these accounts is their maddening complexity. Even people who have followed personal finance for a while confuse them with the more popular health care flexible spending account, which \u2014 unlike an H.S.A. \u2014 does not allow you to invest the money and spend decades watching the earnings compound.H.S.A.s and the campaign to goad more of us into them represent yet another step in the decades-long fetishization of private accounts in general. The big idea here is to shift more of the responsibility for our financial well-being away from employers and the government and directly toward us, whether we know a lot about money or not.These \u201caccount-based solutions,\u201d as government enthusiasts like to refer to them (sounds innocuous, right?) have been proposed so often \u2014 over the last 30 years or so \u2014 that we have wound up with a big bowl of alphabet soup. There are 401(k)\u2019s, I.R.A.s, Roths, 529s, F.S.A.s, D.C.A.s and T.R.A.s \u2014 and that\u2019s before you start filling out your annual Fafsa (student financial aid application) and 1040 (you know this one) to track all this stuff. None of it goes down easy, and it\u2019s probably going to get worse.To prepare yourself, begin with a quick review session on H.S.A.s. To qualify, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan. This year, that deductible has to be at least $1,300 for individual coverage and $2,600 for family coverage. As for the health savings account itself, individuals can drop in as much as $3,400 (including any employer contribution), and families can deposit $6,750.Let\u2019s step into a cold bath of realism before we go too much further here. The criticisms of the Affordable Care Act are overwrought. Of course anything that big and complicated would not be perfect \u2014 or anything close to it \u2014 for many years. Nor should we expect the Republicans who are in power now to have a quick and easy blueprint for the necessary repair work. It\u2019s just too complex, and every proposal above is merely a starting point for negotiation. We will be at this for a very long time.Still, one clear pattern is emerging. Rather than just letting the government directly buy and pay for the thing that we all seem to want more of \u2014 good, affordable health insurance \u2014 the politicians in power want to push us toward a system that uses the levers of the tax system and individual accounts to make this happen instead. It is not simple, and complexity usually adds costs. It also leaves the less educated and overly busy behind and tends to produce other consequences that we cannot predict and do not intend.We shouldn\u2019t expect things to work out any differently with H.S.A.s unless large piles of money go into them automatically, as they might under some of the proposed plans. If free money does show up through some kind of tax break, they\u2019ll at least be difficult for people to ignore.So as you watch and listen and wonder how the health insurance debates will unfold, consider the following as you decide if it\u2019s worthwhile to lobby your elected representatives: Health savings accounts today are most useful for the affluent, who earn the most, have the most left over and have the most to gain by avoiding income taxes, given that they pay them at higher rates.Is that something we wish to cement and perpetuate? Because if we do, our health care system will start to resemble a wealth care system, too.Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Baby in a Box? Free Cardboard Bassinets Encourage Safe Sleeping", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAMDEN, N.J. \u2014 Jernica Qui\u00f1ones, a mother of five, was the first parent in New Jersey to get her free baby box \u2014 a portable, low-tech bassinet made of laminated cardboard. But first, she had to take an online course about safe sleeping practices, which experts say can sharply reduce the chances of sudden infant death syndrome.\u201cBasically, you want to have the baby on the mattress, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she said after watching a 20-minute series of videos.The message may not be new. But health officials say it is critical to keeping babies safe. To reduce infant mortality, parents must put babies to sleep on their backs on a firm mattress in either a bassinet or a crib \u2014 with no pillow, blanket, stuffed animal or bumpers.\u201cHonestly, people like free things,\u201d she added. \u201cThe box is the incentive for the education. And the box comes with Pampers, baby wipes, a onesie, breast-feeding pads and other goodies.\u201dIn 2014, the most recent year for which statistics were available, 57 of New Jersey\u2019s 61 cases of sudden unexpected infant death, or 93 percent, involved an unsafe sleep circumstance, Dr. McCans said. The risks included the presence of a blanket, which poses a strangulation or suffocation hazard; parents who sleep next to their babies, creating the potential of rolling onto them; and instances of entrapment in which an infant becomes wedged between couch cushions or between an ill-fitting crib mattress and a crib frame.\u201cI understand that that\u2019s a small sample size, but that\u2019s still a lot of babies who died,\u201d Dr. McCans said. \u201cRelative to other states, New Jersey has good statistics for sudden, unexplained infant death. And that\u2019s great, but if we are still losing 50 babies a year \u2014 or even one \u2014 and there is something we can do to increase the knowledge base, to me that just makes sense.\u201dNationwide, New Jersey has the lowest rate of sudden unexpected infant death, or SUID, an umbrella category that encompasses the more familiar sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, as well as accidental suffocation or strangulation and unknown causes. Federal data captures three-year segments, and from 2011 to 2013, New Jersey\u2019s SUID rate of 0.5 per 1,000 live births was tied with California for the lowest. The national rate for this period was 0.87 per 1,000 live births.Last spring, Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia began its own baby box program. Camden, a postindustrial city confronting high crime, unemployment and poverty, is across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, so Dr. McCans and her colleagues quickly learned about Temple\u2019s initiative.New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board already had a safe-sleep program, using about $40,000 each year from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state will use that financing for the new program, but the Baby Box Company has pledged to come up with the rest of the money needed to provide free baby boxes statewide.Company officials declined to say what the projected costs were for the state, citing proprietary information.Companies like Pampers and Lansinoh, which sells breast-feeding products, supply the items inside the box.In New Jersey, parents can opt to have the baby box shipped to their home for free, or can pick it up at distribution sites like hospitals or social service agencies \u2014 and eventually public libraries.The distribution network in New Jersey is still being developed. Cooper University Hospital was the first such site, starting its program in January.\u201cThe plan is to have at least several distribution sites in every county,\u201d Dr. McCans said.In the first two weeks of the program, more than 12,000 people took the online course, according to the Baby Box Company.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it did not endorse any products, including the baby box. Still, a spokeswoman for the agency, Nikki Mayes, said parents should take sufficient steps to help reduce the risks of sudden infant death.Nationwide, about 3,700 infants died suddenly and unexpectedly in 2015, according to the agency. Such deaths have fallen significantly since the 1990s, when the American Academy of Pediatrics released safe-sleep recommendations, including urging parents to put infants to bed on their backs. Sudden infant death syndrome rates declined from 130.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 38.7 in 2014.While many new parents already have proper gear for their newborns, New Jersey officials say everyone can benefit from the baby box program. The boxes are a useful supplement to a bassinet or crib and can be easily transported for an overnight stay in a hotel or with grandparents.Ms. Qui\u00f1ones, 33, said she had already owned a bassinet for her 3-month-old son, Bless\u2019n, but kept it upstairs. Before she picked up the baby box, which is now in the living room, she had to run upstairs to check on him.\u201cIt came in handy for me,\u201d she said.Dr. McCans said many new parents laid a sleeping infant on a couch during the day, when family life revolves around the kitchen and living room. Couch cushions, like crib bumpers, can lead to poor air flow around a baby\u2019s mouth.\u201cTen or 15 years ago, we may not have recognized that couches were particularly dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if a baby turns partially, the face might not clear. If there is a gap, the baby can get wedged.\u201dWhile putting babies in cardboard boxes might strike some as too downscale, especially in an era of $1,000-and-up cribs, Dr. McCans thinks the boxes might appeal to millennials who value minimalism.\u201cThere are a lot of people who are trying to simplify their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cIf millennials see that this is cool and renewable and nontoxic, and if it catches their attention so they get the education in a format that is acceptable to them, then I don\u2019t see any harm. We\u2019re trying to target everybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Former I.M.F. Leader Sentenced for Embezzlement", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Rodrigo Rato, a former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was convicted on Thursday on charges of misusing the funds of a Spanish bank that he led to near-collapse. He was sentenced to four and a half years in jail.Mr. Rato is the most prominent person to have been convicted since the rescue of the bank, Bankia, in 2012. As such, he has been the face of anger against elites and financial industry executives in Spain, which had to bail out its ailing banks during the European debt crisis.He was sentenced alongside 64 other Bankia directors and executives, who were accused of making unlawful credit card purchases that totaled 12.5 million euros, or $13.2 million, over a decade.The conviction represents a drastic shift in his reputation. Once thought to be a potential Spanish prime minister, Mr. Rato had been finance minister in the conservative government of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar. In 2004, he left for Washington to take the helm of the I.M.F., winning the job because of his reputation for having presided over the early stages of Spain\u2019s construction-led economic boom.After returning to Spain, Mr. Rato was appointed in 2010 to run Caja Madrid, a regional lender. He soon spearheaded a seven-way merger to form Bankia, consolidating banks after Spain\u2019s construction bubble burst in 2008. But instead of shoring up the sector, the move led to the near-collapse of the new bank.Mr. Rato was forced to resign in May 2012, just before Bankia was nationalized and the Spanish government negotiated a European bailout to rescue the country\u2019s banking sector.The sentence handed down on Thursday can be appealed, but Mr. Rato and other former Bankia executives are also awaiting a ruling in a separate, broader case that is centered on claims of mismanagement of the lender.In that case, he and others are accused of misrepresenting Bankia\u2019s financial soundness as it prepared a public stock offering in 2011. The bank went on to report a loss in 2012 of \u20ac19.2 billion, the largest in Spanish corporate history.He is also being investigated separately for tax evasion relating to purchases of property.The case against Mr. Rato and his former colleagues for mismanaging Bankia and misstating its accounts began shortly after the bank\u2019s bailout.The following year, Mr. Rato and others were ordered to stand trial for misusing their credit card privileges from 2003 to 2012. They also stood accused of providing unauthorized company credit cards to dozens of board members and friends.The cards were used for personal purchases that included clothing, restaurants and travel, as well as cash withdrawals. Some were also used to pay for golf, seats at the bullring and private parties.At the time, the prosecution said Mr. Rato made illegal purchases of \u20ac54,800 while he led Bankia, while Mr. Blesa spent \u20ac436,700 with his corporate cards. Both eventually reimbursed the amounts.The ruling on Thursday focused, however, on Mr. Blesa\u2019s role as architect of the corporate credit card scheme and that of Mr. Rato in extending the scheme once he took charge. The court said that Mr. Rato not only benefited personally but also maintained \u201cthe same dynamic in every aspect\u201d as his predecessor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Economic Arrogance", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI guess this was only to be expected from a man who keeps insisting that crime, which is actually near record lows, is at a record high, that millions of illegal ballots were responsible for his popular vote loss, and so on: In Trumpworld, numbers are what you want them to be, and anything else is fake news. But the truth is that unwarranted arrogance about economics isn\u2019t Trump-specific. On the contrary, it\u2019s the modern Republican norm. And the question is why.Before I get there, a word about why extreme growth optimism is unwarranted.For one thing, in the Reagan years baby boomers were still entering the work force. Now they\u2019re on their way out, and the rise in the working-age population has slowed to a crawl. This demographic shift alone should, other things being equal, subtract around a percentage point from U.S. growth.The only way we could have a growth miracle now would be a huge takeoff in productivity \u2014 output per worker-hour. This could, of course, happen: maybe driverless flying cars will arrive en masse. But it\u2019s hardly something one should assume for a baseline projection.And it\u2019s certainly not something one should count on as a result of conservative economic policies. Which brings me to the strange arrogance of the economic right.As I said, belief that tax cuts and deregulation will reliably produce awesome growth isn\u2019t unique to the Trump-Putin administration. We heard the same thing from Jeb Bush (who?); we hear it from congressional Republicans like Paul Ryan. The question is why. After all, there is nothing \u2014 nothing at all \u2014 in the historical record to justify this arrogance.The evidence, then, is totally at odds with claims that tax-cutting and deregulation are economic wonder drugs. So why does a whole political party continue to insist that they are the answer to all problems?It would be nice to pretend that we\u2019re still having a serious, honest discussion here, but we aren\u2019t. At this point we have to get real and talk about whose interests are being served.Never mind whether slashing taxes on billionaires while giving scammers and polluters the freedom to scam and pollute is good for the economy as a whole; it\u2019s clearly good for billionaires, scammers, and polluters. Campaign finance being what it is, this creates a clear incentive for politicians to keep espousing a failed doctrine, for think tanks to keep inventing new excuses for that doctrine, and more.And on such matters Donald Trump is really no worse than the rest of his party. Unfortunately, he\u2019s also no better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the G.O.P. Wants Trump to Say Tonight", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 When he addresses Congress for the first time on Tuesday night, Donald J. Trump will do so as one of the most untraditional and unexpected presidents in American history. The election, however close, was a decisive statement by the American people against the status quo, an expression of the hope that he would break the stalemate in Washington and lead the country in a new direction.Mr. Trump can take pride in his cabinet choices, the deregulatory thrust he and the Republican Congress have initiated and the boldness he has shown in shaking up the established order and the elites in Washington. His decision to push ahead on the Keystone pipeline is the triumph of common sense over environmental orthodoxy. And his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a master stroke that conservatives celebrate and even liberal jurists respect.I have no doubt that President Trump will spend much of his speech making the case for three initiatives that are already underway in Congress: the rebuilding of the military, the repeal and replacement of the failing Affordable Care Act and the long overdue reform of the tax code. And he will surely discuss his proposals for something most Americans strongly favor \u2014 enhanced border security.However, President Trump will need to do more than merely wait upon a Republican Congress to produce the legislation he has championed. He must become an active participant in the legislative process.There are many knotty issues that must be resolved with respect to all these points in his agenda. How much money will be pumped into the Pentagon, and will it be offset by reduced spending on domestic priorities such as early childhood education, biomedical research and clean drinking water?Do Republicans finance their new health care system by keeping some of the Obamacare taxes or, as some suggest, taxing upper-end health insurance plans \u2014 an idea they previously opposed?There are divisions within Republican ranks in Congress on all these issues. Many support a border-adjustment tax, for example, but a large number passionately oppose the idea. Only presidential leadership can resolve them. And resolving each issue will require President Trump to take ownership of the final decision and sell it to different factions within the Republican Party, and to the country as a whole. Presidents must lead, and leadership will be required to meet the objectives Mr. Trump has laid out.There are other initiatives I hope the president addresses in this speech and those to come. In the opinion of many on both sides of the aisle, President Obama conducted unauthorized and therefore illegal wars in Libya, Syria and other parts of the Middle East. A new effort against the Islamic State requires a new congressional authorization for the use of force. President Trump should ask for it.Preserving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and putting America on a sound fiscal footing requires the reform of the entitlement system. President Trump should embrace that cause. Ronald Reagan did it with respect to Social Security, and won 49 states in his re-election. And as much as all Americans embrace President Trump\u2019s call for enormous new investments in infrastructure, he owes the country an explanation of how he is going to pay for it. President Dwight D. Eisenhower did just that when he built the Interstate System of highways.Finally, there is the vexing issue of illegal immigration. President Trump is right to focus first on border security. Previous administrations have promised to do so, yet failed to deliver. And he is correct to demand that those who entered America illegally and committed serious crimes be deported.But that\u2019s just the start. Once the public is convinced that these tasks are being undertaken, the president will have to decide what to do with those who entered the country illegally but, once here, have obeyed the law, contributed to our economy and often had children who are citizens. Eventually, the president will have to address this issue in a manner which is practical, just and comprehensive. No previous president has managed to do so. Given his reputation for toughness on immigration, Mr. Trump might have the credibility to create a consensus.Our last two presidents tried and failed to unite the country. Indeed, each left it more divided than he found it. President Trump instead has opted to do big things in the hope that by achieving them he can renew the American spirit and bring the country together through deeds, not words. It is a worthy goal. Every American should hope he succeeds.Tom Cole is a Republican representative from Oklahoma.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.T.F. Filled Secret Bank Account With Millions From Shadowy Cigarette Sales", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Working from an office suite behind a Burger King in southern Virginia, operatives used a web of shadowy cigarette sales to funnel tens of millions of dollars into a secret bank account. They weren\u2019t known smugglers, but rather agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.The operation, not authorized under Justice Department rules, gave agents an off-the-books way to finance undercover investigations and pay informants without the usual cumbersome paperwork and close oversight, according to court records and people close to the operation.The secret account is at the heart of a federal racketeering lawsuit brought by a collective of tobacco farmers who say they were swindled out of $24 million. A pair of A.T.F. informants received at least $1 million each from that sum, records show.The scheme relied on phony shipments of snack food disguised as tobacco. The agents were experts: Their job was to catch cigarette smugglers, so they knew exactly how it was done.Government records and interviews with people involved reveal an operation that existed on a murky frontier \u2014 between investigating smuggling and being complicit in it. After The New York Times began asking about the operation last summer, the Justice Department disclosed it to the department\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office, which is investigating. The inspector general \u201cexpressed serious concerns,\u201d court records show.It is unclear how broadly the A.T.F. adopted this practice, at what level it was approved, and whether it continues. Nearly all references to the A.T.F. have been blacked out of public court records, and most documents are entirely sealed.The investigation and the looming racketeering trial will bring renewed scrutiny to the A.T.F., which has been buffeted in recent years by the botched gun-tracking operation known as Fast and Furious and its mismanagement of undercover investigations. Representative Jason Chaffetz, whose House oversight committee investigated Fast and Furious, asked the A.T.F. on Wednesday for reams of documents related to the secret tobacco account.Members of Congress, particularly Republicans, have heaped criticism on the agency for decades, and the National Rifle Association has lobbied to limit the agency\u2019s authority and funding.Documents in the racketeering lawsuit outline the A.T.F. operation. The tobacco cooperative is suing a former employee and a consultant who, according to court documents, both worked as A.T.F. informants. The informants have denied all wrongdoing.Part of their defense, records show, is that they acted on behalf of the government. In response, a judge recently added the United States government as a defendant.In spring 2011, U.S. Tobacco Cooperative was looking to expand its distribution network. The co-op is made up of about 700 tobacco farmers \u2014 from Virginia to Florida \u2014 who pool their crops and share the profits. Based in Raleigh, N.C., the company is a major exporter to China and produces discount-brand cigarettes including Wildhorse, Traffic and 1839.\u201cThese are really, really good people,\u201d said Stuart D. Thompson, the cooperative\u2019s chief executive. \u201cEvery year, they take all their chips. They put them on the table, and they hope they get them all back.\u201dThe company began negotiating to buy a tobacco distributor in Bristol, Va., Big South Wholesale. Big South\u2019s owners, Jason Carpenter and Christopher Small, had a network of customers and owned a warehouse.They also had an existing secret relationship with the A.T.F., records show.A.T.F. agents try to disrupt these networks. Often that means working with informants to buy and sell tobacco on the black market, much the way agents pose as drug dealers to investigate cartels.Because so much of the case remains sealed, Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small are prohibited from answering questions about nearly every aspect of the case. \u201cEverything we did that is being attacked now in litigation, we did in good faith,\u201d they said in a statement.Exactly who at U.S. Tobacco knew about their A.T.F. ties and what they knew are a matter of dispute. But there were signs that Big South was not a simple tobacco distributor. Its assets included more than two dozen vehicles, including expensive S.U.V.s and a fleet of Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and Jaguar sports cars.Early 2011 was a time of intense pressure inside the A.T.F. The agency was under fire from Congress over the Fast and Furious operation, in which agents allowed gun traffickers to buy weapons and ship them to Mexico, hoping the shipments could lead them to major weapons dealers. Justice Department auditors began scrutinizing how A.T.F. agents managed their tobacco smuggling investigations.With that audit continuing, the A.T.F. issued new rules to tightly monitor undercover investigations. Soon after those rules went into effect, U.S. Tobacco completed its purchase of Big South for $5.5 million, a deal that gave Big South the authority to buy and sell cigarettes on behalf of the cooperative. Almost immediately, the farmers say, Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small began defrauding them.It worked like this: An export company working with the A.T.F. placed an order for cigarettes to be shipped internationally \u2014 thus not subject to American taxes. Big South would instead ship bottled water and potato chips, making it look as if cigarettes had been exported. Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small would then buy the tobacco at a slight markup through a private bank account. Lastly, they would sell the tobacco to Big South, again at a markup.Because they had the authority to buy on behalf of the tobacco cooperative, \u201cCarpenter and Small simply sold products to themselves,\u201d the farmers wrote in court documents. All of these transactions occurred on paper. The cigarettes never left the Virginia warehouse.\u201cIt\u2019s what I saw with my own eyes,\u201d said Brandon Moore, the warehouse manager and one of the people who discussed the transactions in the case. Their accounts fit with descriptions in court records.Mr. Moore said he was aware of the A.T.F. operation but became troubled by it as he learned more. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be going on, even if it is the A.T.F.,\u201d he said.In one deal described in the lawsuit, the informants bought tobacco at $15 a carton and sold it to U.S. Tobacco at $17.50. The profit, about $519,000, went into what was known as a \u201cmanagement account.\u201d That account, while controlled by Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small, helped pay for A.T.F. investigations.Mr. Moore, the warehouse manager, said agents often told him what to buy on the company\u2019s credit card. For instance, he recalled spending tens of thousands of dollars at Best Buy on iPads, televisions and other gifts to curry favor with potential criminal targets.Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small have also acknowledged in court documents receiving more than $1 million each, though it is not clear from public documents whether that was profit or reimbursement for expenses paid on behalf of the government.How that arrangement began is unclear. Ryan Kaye, an A.T.F. supervisor, testified that the management account was created \u201cas a result of verbal directives from the A.T.F. program office and other headquarters officials.\u201d Mr. Kaye\u2019s full statement is sealed, but excerpts are cited in one publicly available document.The defendants in the lawsuit contend that U.S. Tobacco got a good deal on the cigarettes, even at the prices they paid. The farmers tell a different story, saying they never would have purchased Big South if they understood that Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small had a side arrangement that involved selling them tobacco at inflated values.Thomas Lesnak, a retired A.T.F. agent who was involved in the operation, dismissed suggestions that anything was done improperly. He said he could not discuss Big South because the Justice Department was still conducting investigations based on information developed during operations based at the warehouse.The arrangement began to break down in late 2012, when Mr. Thompson joined U.S. Tobacco as the chief financial officer. He was curious why his warehouse was placing so many orders for a brand of cigarette that competes against U.S. Tobacco. He could not get a straight answer, the company said in court documents.In March 2013, Mr. Moore picked up the phone, called Mr. Thompson and explained what was happening. \u201cI did what I did because of the ethics of it,\u201d Mr. Moore said recently. \u201cWhat was happening there was wrong.\u201dOnce U.S. Tobacco discovered the bookkeeping irregularities, it reported them to the Justice Department, which investigates white-collar crime and government misconduct. Records show that the Justice Department, which includes the A.T.F., investigated some aspects of the case but no charges were filed.\u201cWe voted unanimously to give everything we had to the government,\u201d said Charlie Batten, a U.S. Tobacco board member whose family has worked the same North Carolina soil for generations. \u201cWe thought they would take it and run with it. What happened was, they\u2019ve fought us tooth and nail.\u201dBecause of the sealing order, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Batten and others are prohibited from discussing what happened to the money \u2014 even with their own farmers.Three years into its lawsuit, U.S. Tobacco still cannot disentangle itself from the government. The cooperative recently told a judge that it was under investigation by the Treasury Department.All those secret tobacco sales, it turns out, should have been taxed. And the government wants its money.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Foodies Know: Boulder Has Become a Hub for New Producers", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOULDER, Colo. \u2014 Quinn Snacks was founded in Arlington, Mass., in 2011. The company\u2019s goal was to \u201cclean up\u201d microwave popcorn, which had come under fire for the material used in its bags, and trans fats and other ingredients that many of today\u2019s consumers find offensive.But just a couple of years later, Quinn\u2019s founders and three of its employees picked up stakes and moved to this city, which Coulter Lewis, a co-founder, described as the ideal place for a small food company.\u201cWhen we were getting started, Kristy was calling all over the place to figure out where to get ingredients and the packaging we\u2019d need,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, referring to his wife, also a company co-founder. \u201cOver time, she was calling people in Boulder three, four, five times a week for advice, and we just realized that our support network was here.\u201dBoulder is perhaps best known for craft beer and bicycles \u2014 there\u2019s almost one for every person living here \u2014 and for being home to Mork and Mindy. But among foodies, it is also known as the place where new companies are challenging the old guard in the food business.Up-and-coming food companies like Purely Elizabeth, Made in Nature and Good Karma Foods have relocated to Boulder to take advantage of the city\u2019s deep bench of food executives, a food retail environment that prizes innovation and experimentation, and a growing pool of money for investments in food companies, among other things.And the infrastructure such companies need \u2014 brokers, distributors, contract manufacturers \u2014 is arriving as well. The second-largest natural foods distributor, KeHE, opened an office here in 2013, and the Rodale Institute, a nonprofit research group devoted to organic farming, is opening a satellite office here.\u201cThere\u2019s an ecosystem here that supports food entrepreneurs that you just don\u2019t find in other places,\u201d said Justin Gold, who founded Justin\u2019s, a nut butter company, here in 2004. \u201cEverything you need, including a lot of experience and expertise, is right here.\u201dThe money flowing to food start-ups here still trails New York and Silicon Valley. Food and beverage start-ups in Boulder, which has just over 100,000 residents, attracted $76 million from September 2012 to September 2016, according to CB Insights, a research firm, compared with $315 million in New York and $616 million in Silicon Valley.But the vast majority of the money in New York and Northern California has gone to just a few companies. In Boulder, the money is more widely spread among dozens of companies that make everything from gluten-free cereals to probiotic drinks.And its monthly networking nights attract as many as 200 people, including luminaries like Steve Demos, the founder of Silk, which produces dairy substitutes, and Todd Woloson, a founder of Izze, the fizzy fruit-flavored drink company, who built businesses here long before Boulder became a foodie mecca.Then, of course, there is Boulder\u2019s reputation for good food. The city frequently is listed in foodie magazines as a great place to dine, and its denizens prize \u201cclean\u201d foods, making it a natural place to test new products.\u201cThe household penetration of natural products is disproportionately high,\u201d Mr. Demos said, \u201cand the risk factor to prove viability is lower than it might be in the big cities on the coasts.\u201dAnd if entrepreneurs can\u2019t make one of Naturally Boulder\u2019s networking nights or morning mixers, they have a good chance of running into someone like Mr. Demos at the Whole Foods on Pearl Street downtown \u2014 a place that is to spotting food celebrities what the Polo Lounge is to spotting movie stars.\u201cI think that\u2019s Mo in the checkout line over there,\u201d said Tom Rich, vice president of Whole Foods\u2019s Rocky Mountain region, squinting across the store at Mo Siegel, one of the founders of Celestial Seasonings.\u201cIt\u2019s a small place, really, and you just bump into people like that here and they\u2019re going to give you their phone number or email address and actually respond when you call or write them,\u201d said Mr. Rich, who got his start bagging groceries in the Pearl Street store and is now considered something of a legend by many food entrepreneurs.Mr. Rich gave start-ups like Justin\u2019s and Madhava Sweeteners a stab at selling in Whole Foods and has helped cultivate the infrastructure here that supports them.In addition to Whole Foods, other grocery stores in Boulder, like Lucky\u2019s Markets, Alfalfa\u2019s Market and even King Soopers, a regional Kroger chain, serve as a testing ground for young companies.Birch Benders, a pancake mix business that is working to dent sales of Bisquick and Aunt Jemima, got its first shot at Lucky\u2019s, an organic grocery chain that Kroger took a stake in last year. Matt LaCasse, one of Birch Benders\u2019s founders, had landed in Boulder in 2011 after graduating from Yale and was looking for a way to stay at the end of a long ski season.In 2011, Lucky\u2019s asked Birch Benders to demonstrate its product in one of its stores. Customers flocked to its table for samples served with juice. But it didn\u2019t move off the shelves.The grocer stuck with Birch Benders, however, through four or five iterations of the product, Mr. LaCasse said. Once the company got the price down to $4.99 and $5.99 for a one-pound pouch, Birch Benders began flying off the shelves.Now Birch Benders mixes are sold in Target, Safeway, Giant Eagle and Whole Foods.Birch Benders also tapped into other local resources. The company started with money from friends and family but was quickly able to get financing from Boulder Food Group, a private equity firm started by Tom Spier using money from the sale of Evol Foods, which he co-founded.But B.F.G., as it\u2019s known here, isn\u2019t the only local investment firm focusing on the local food scene. Mr. Woloson, formerly of Izze, heads up Greenmont Capital Partners, which has made investments in Madhava Sweeteners, based in nearby Longmont, and Door to Door Organics, a grocery delivery business in Lafayette.Now, other financial interests are circling. Last fall, Rabobank, a big Dutch bank, held its third Food Bytes conference in Boulder, attracting more investors and company executives than it had to previous rounds of the event, which were held in San Francisco and Brooklyn.Then there\u2019s New Resource Bank, which provides services for companies with so-called triple bottom lines \u2014 social and environmental, along with financial. It chose to open its second branch in Boulder last year.\u201cWe looked at Los Angeles, Seattle and a few other places, and the Boulder area really came out on top in terms of having a critical mass of the types of companies we work with,\u201d said Vincent Siciliano, the bank\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOne of the big draws in Boulder is the fact that they have hundreds of start-up food businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Watchdog Protecting Consumers May Be Too Effective", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWhy would the president want to rein in the only federal agency dedicated to the consumer finance beat? Perhaps it has been a little too effective in pursuing wrongdoing by banks, consumer credit reporting companies, credit card issuers and student loan collectors.Republican lawmakers like Mr. Hensarling have been trying to hobble the bureau ever since its creation in 2012 under Dodd-Frank. But none of these efforts have gotten far.Future rule-making could also come under fire, Ms. Truong said. \u201cIf the C.F.P.B. was to adopt new regulations,\u201d she said, \u201cthere would be greater potential for Congress to put a stop to it by removing C.F.P.B.\u2019s authority to adopt those rules or taking action after the fact to undo the regulations.\u201dAnd in a blinding glimpse of the obvious, the Fed also urged banks that \u201ccommunications with consumers should provide clear and balanced information about the relative benefits and risks of the products.\u201dOne of the C.F.P.B.\u2019s best features is its unusual complaint process, in which it acts as intermediary between consumers who believe they have been wronged and the companies they have had problems with.Since July 2011, the bureau has handled over one million such complaints, sending them to the companies and ensuring that they respond. It has published more than 700,000 of these grievances on its website.\u201cComplaints can really tell us about business practices that pose risks to consumers,\u201d said Darian Dorsey, deputy assistant director for the office of consumer response at the bureau, in an interview. \u201cWe take all this information together to understand the problems consumers are experiencing and to enable the bureau to improve the marketplace.\u201dThis system is the largest database of consumer finance complaints in the country, bureau officials say. Monthly reports analyzing the grievances received by the bureau are available on its website, providing a real-time snapshot of problems consumers are experiencing in their financial lives.On the website, consumers can also describe their experience with a financial company. So far, more than 130,000 of these narratives have been published.\u201cIf you reach out to C.F.P.B. with a complaint, not only does it get saved in this transparent database for others to look at,\u201d Mr. Hounanian said, \u201cyou will receive a response within a couple of days, and within weeks should have a response from your student loan servicer.\u201dThe reports are also a help to consumers because they name names. For example, in the November analysis, the companies receiving the most complaints were the three top credit reporting firms: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, with almost 4,000 complaints combined.Of course, the C.F.P.B. also allows companies to give their side of the story, Ms. Dorsey said. As such, the database provides a glimpse into how companies respond to consumer complaints.\u201cListening to consumers has been so valuable to our work,\u201d Ms. Dorsey said. \u201cAnd it can be very valuable to the marketplace as well.\u201dAmong federal regulators, that\u2019s a novel approach, and one that should be cheered, not jeered.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Cities Should Take Care of Their Housing Problems", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhile President Trump talks repeatedly about fixing America\u2019s inner cities, it\u2019s a good bet that in the coming years, New York and other large metropolitan areas will need to be more self-reliant in solving pressing problems, especially low-income housing.After all, many big cities face a triple threat: Mr. Trump wants to cut funding to sanctuary cities; his nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, is unlikely to be a strong and creative leader; and the Republican Congress is eager to chip away at federal housing programs. In response, cities need local financing initiatives that make up for the coming reduction in federal assistance.While no city has such a plan in place, this strategy has been tried right here in New York. The city has already channeled approximately $1 billion from luxury development for affordable housing into communities like Harlem and the South Bronx.The history of this financing dates back three decades, when the Battery Park City development in Lower Manhattan was in its nascent stages. Planners intended to include low-income housing with the offices and luxury apartments and condos.But when Sandy Frucher, the head of the Battery Park City Authority, asked leaders of poor and minority communities if they would prefer a few apartments in this new neighborhood or money to fix up far more housing in their own, he says they chose the latter.As part of this strategy, the authority dropped most of its affordable housing plans, which helped jump-start high-end development in this once isolated part of the city. It then took a slice of the \u201cexcess profits\u201d the authority generated from expanding ground rents and real estate taxes it collected from new buildings and directed them to finance low-income projects in distressed areas.These recurrent flows backed a $150 million bond, issued in 1987. Use of debt expedited renovation. Improved units, which were designated rent stabilized, remain affordable to this day.This highly rated, triple-tax-free issuance enabled reasonable interest costs. The same thing could happen today with similarly structured bonds, likely paying less than 1 percent.Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who approved the deal, felt it gave Battery Park City a soul. Today, a similar plan would also give the city a hand up in dealing with Washington.Levying a luxury-housing tax citywide is straightforward; the trick is justly defining what price makes a rental or condo \u201cluxury,\u201d then determining an appropriate annual tax rate.Targeting properties for improvement is another challenge. Back when the Battery Park City program started, the city regularly took ownership of rundown buildings for failure to pay property taxes, then used the program\u2019s money to fix them up.Abandoned buildings have largely disappeared in a booming real estate market, but there\u2019s still tax-delinquent and bank-foreclosed inventory available on the cheap. Slum landlords in litigation could be forced to turn over their properties. These properties could be handed to nonprofit groups that would undertake renovations, ensuring adequate maintenance and responsible tenancy.According to Carol Lamberg, who was executive director of one such organization, the Settlement Housing Fund, from 1983 to 2014, there are dozens of well-run nonprofit housing and community development operations in the city that could manage the entire process, from site identification and redevelopment to tenant selection and property management.The money could finance new construction over municipal parking lots and abandoned industrial areas and along coastlines in the Bronx, in Brooklyn and on Staten Island.But this luxury housing tax diverges from Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s \u201cinclusive\u201d strategy of mixing struggling tenants in with affluent occupants, for which developers get a tax credit. But that approach has problems: Low-income residents often can\u2019t afford daily living expenses in affluent neighborhoods; it drains municipal finances; and a substantial number of affordable units revert to market price within 30 years.An affordable-housing tax, in contrast, would exploit development forces without dampening them or draining public budgets and borrowing capacity. It would fund improvement where it\u2019s not happening and aid households the market has left behind.Providing safe, clean homes for those who can\u2019t afford them is key to helping needy citizens become more productive and independent citizens \u2014 a concept lost on President Trump.This approach is applicable countrywide, where there are strong luxury housing markets and low-income working residents who can\u2019t afford permanent shelter.We need to start responding to President Trump\u2019s new reality. One way to do this is to restart this proven form of local revenue sharing.Eric Uhlfelder is a financial journalist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have We Lost Sight of the Promise of Public Schools?", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsIn the days leading up to and after Betsy DeVos\u2019s confirmation as secretary of education, a hashtag spread across Twitter: #publicschoolproud. Parents and teachers tweeted photos of their kids studying, performing, eating lunch together. People of all races tweeted about how public schools changed them, saved them, helped them succeed. The hashtag and storytelling was a rebuttal to DeVos, who called traditional public schools a \u201cdead end\u201d and who bankrolled efforts to pass reforms in Michigan, her home state, that would funnel public funds in the form of vouchers into religious and privately operated schools and encouraged the proliferation of for-profit charter schools. The tweets railed against DeVos\u2019s labeling of public schools as an industry that needed to adopt the free-market principles of competition and choice. #Publicschoolproud was seen as an effort to show that public schools still mattered.But the enthusiastic defense obscured a larger truth: We began moving away from the \u201cpublic\u201d in public education a long time ago. In fact, treating public schools like a business these days is largely a matter of fact in many places. Parents have pushed for school-choice policies that encourage shopping for public schools that they hope will give their children an advantage and for the expansion of charter schools that are run by private organizations with public funds. Large numbers of public schools have selective admissions policies that keep most kids out. And parents pay top dollar to buy into neighborhoods zoned to \u201cgood\u201d public schools that can be as exclusive as private ones. The glaring reality is, whether we are talking about schools or other institutions, it seems as if we have forgotten what \u201cpublic\u201d really means.Early on, it was this investment in public institutions that set America apart from other countries. Public hospitals ensured that even the indigent received good medical care \u2014 health problems for some could turn into epidemics for us all. Public parks gave access to the great outdoors not just to the wealthy who could retreat to their country estates but to the masses in the nation\u2019s cities. Every state invested in public universities. Public schools became widespread in the 1800s, not to provide an advantage for particular individuals but with the understanding that shuffling the wealthy and working class together (though not black Americans and other racial minorities) would create a common sense of citizenship and national identity, that it would tie together the fates of the haves and the have-nots and that doing so benefited the nation. A sense of the public good was a unifying force because it meant that the rich and the poor, the powerful and the meek, shared the spoils \u2014 as well as the burdens \u2014 of this messy democracy.At the same time, the New Deal stoked the ire of a small-government, antiregulation minority, who began to push back, though it would take some decades before their views became mainstream. They promoted free-market principles, deregulation and the privatization of functions normally handled by the government and sought to define all things \u2014 like the benefits of education \u2014 strictly in terms of their economic value.Nonetheless, Roosevelt\u2019s government expansion was widely supported, and Americans elected him to an unprecedented four terms as president. But the broad support of public programs and institutions hinged on a narrow definition of who that public was: white Americans. To get his New Deal passed, Roosevelt compromised with white Southerners in Congress, and much of the legislation either explicitly or implicitly discriminated against black citizens, denying them many of its benefits.As the civil rights movement gained ground in the 1950s and 1960s, however, a series of court rulings and new laws ensured that black Americans now had the same legal rights to public schools, libraries, parks and swimming pools as white Americans. But as black Americans became part of the public, white Americans began to pull away. Instead of sharing their public pools with black residents \u2014 whose tax dollars had also paid for them \u2014 white Americans founded private clubs (often with public funds) or withdrew behind their fences where they dug their own pools. Public housing was once seen as a community good that drew presidents for photo ops. But after federal housing policies helped white Americans buy their own homes in the suburbs, black Americans, who could not get government-subsidized mortgages, languished in public housing, which became stigmatized. Where once public transportation showed a city\u2019s forward progress, white communities began to fight its expansion, fearing it would give unwanted people access to their enclaves.And white Americans began to withdraw from public schools or move away from school districts with large numbers of black children once the courts started mandating desegregation. Some communities shuttered public schools altogether rather than allow black children to share publicly funded schools with white children. The very voucher movement that is at the heart of DeVos\u2019s educational ideas was born of white opposition to school desegregation as state and local governments offered white children vouchers to pay for private schools \u2014 known as segregation academies \u2014 that sprouted across the South after the Supreme Court struck down school segregation in 1954.\u201cWhat had been enjoyed as a public thing by white citizens became a place of forced encounter with other people from whom they wanted to be separate,\u201d Bonnie Honig, a professor of political science and modern culture and media at Brown University and author of the forthcoming book \u201cPublic Things: Democracy in Disrepair,\u201d told me. \u201cThe attractiveness of private schools and other forms of privatization are not just driven by economization but by the desire to control the community with which you interact.\u201dDemocracy works only if those who have the money or the power to opt out of public things choose instead to opt in for the common good. It\u2019s called a social contract, and we\u2019ve seen what happens in cities where the social contract is broken: White residents vote against tax hikes to fund schools where they don\u2019t send their children, parks go untended and libraries shutter because affluent people feel no obligation to help pay for things they don\u2019t need. \u201cThe existence of public things \u2014 to meet each other, to fight about, to pay for together, to enjoy, to complain about \u2014 this is absolutely indispensable to democratic life,\u201d Honig says.If there is hope for a renewal of our belief in public institutions and a common good, it may reside in the public schools. Nine of 10 children attend one, a rate of participation that few, if any, other public bodies can claim, and schools, as segregated as many are, remain one of the few institutions where Americans of different classes and races mix. The vast multiracial, socioeconomically diverse defense of public schools that DeVos set off may show that we have not yet given up on the ideals of the public \u2014 and on ourselves.Nikole Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Early Trump Backer Awaits His Reward", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore he bet big on Donald J. Trump last spring, Duke Buchan III was a mostly anonymous figure on Wall Street.He was financially successful and played polo, but unlike many of the large donors that flock toward presidential candidates in an election year, he was not a billionaire or a big-name financier.Now, Mr. Buchan is looking to reap a juicy dividend on his winning trade: an ambassadorship to Spain, Argentina or Uruguay.Of course there is no guarantee that he will be so rewarded, even though it is widely accepted among Republican money men that Mr. Buchan was an early backer at a time when most of Wall Street was hedging its bets, either wary of being associated with such a fiery figure or predicting that Hillary Clinton would win the election.And Mr. Trump has proved to be unpredictable in his appointments, often casting aside his most ardent advocates.Still, that Mr. Buchan is even in the mix highlights the extent to which those on Wall Street who were timely and generous in terms of deploying their checkbook are now poised for an outsize payoff. It is also a reminder that while bankers and traders may now be cheering Mr. Trump as the stock market surges, many of these same people were ducking fund-raising calls in the months before the election.As president, Mr. Trump has tapped a powerful circle of superwealthy businessmen to advise him, although only a few of them were among his original patrons. In fact, going into the election, his support was insubstantial among rank-and-file financiers, the many thousands of midtier executives in investment firms and hedge funds who are often the financial spine of a winning presidential campaign.All of which makes Mr. Buchan stand out, despite his attempt to keep a low profile. He declined to comment for this article.Mr. Buchan first emerged on the Republican fund-raising scene as one of the many who supported Jeb Bush in 2015, when he served on the executive committee of Mr. Bush\u2019s political action committee, Right to Rise.Unlike many of Mr. Bush\u2019s supporters, however, Mr. Buchan decided to dedicate his time and resources to Mr. Trump last spring. When the Trump campaign announced last May that it would accept outside money for the first time, Mr. Buchan leapt at the opportunity and, along with his wife, committed $898,000 to the candidate\u2019s fund-raising vehicle, Trump Victory \u2014 the maximum allowed under federal campaign laws.Some $10,800 went to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The rest was allocated to the Republican National Committee, thus endearing Mr. Buchan to Reince Priebus, then the head of the committee and now Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff.In explaining his decision, Mr. Buchan told people that he saw the candidate as a disrupter, a fixer and a builder who would bring business acumen to the White House and upset the status quo in government.He also told friends that he had tired of the politically correct strictures of the day and was looking forward to a time when Americans can say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d again, said people who spoke with him about his choice. As a hedge fund investor, Mr. Buchan embraced the candidate\u2019s promises to slash taxes and regulations as well.At a time when Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was struggling and traditional fund-raisers were giving him a wide berth, the donation had a powerful impact, catapulting Mr. Buchan into the candidate\u2019s inner circle.While Mr. Buchan \u2014 and his wife, Hannah, a former investment professional herself \u2014 had known Mr. Trump socially (his children and Mr. Trump\u2019s youngest son went to the same prekindergarten school in New York City), the relationship suddenly became fairly intimate.They tagged along for the rallies, attended the Republican convention and all three presidential debates and co-led nearly 20 fund-raising events for Mr. Trump. That included one of the first major gatherings held for the candidate in New York City last June.At the inauguration, the Buchans went to church with the Trumps, sat nearby while he was sworn in and returned to the White House for lunch.This was heady stuff and a far cry from the farm in Henderson, N.C., where Mr. Buchan grew up. He calls himself a 10th-generation North Carolinian and received his undergraduate degree nearby at the University of North Carolina.His hunger for a top diplomatic job in Madrid dates back to his junior year in Chapel Hill, when, he has said, a year abroad in Seville in southern Spain transformed his life.Mr. Buchan started his career as an investor in 1997 at Maverick Capital in Dallas, the hedge fund set up in 1990 to manage the wealth of the Wyly brothers, Sam and Charles, who became billionaires from their investments in the computer industry and other businesses.There, he had a near brush with regulators. From 1998 to 2000, Mr. Buchan was on the board of Scottish Annuity and Life, one of the many offshore companies that the Wylys established in the 1990s to conduct financial transactions away from the eyes of regulators.Mr. Buchan decided to strike out on his own in 2001 and set up Hunter Global Investors. The fund reached a peak size of $1.5 billion \u2014 a fairly small amount as far as hedge funds go \u2014 before experiencing a surge in investor outflows in 2011, when performance suffered during the European debt crisis.\u201cWe have not weathered the ensuing volatility well,\u201d Mr. Buchan said in a letter to his investors explaining why he was returning their money.Since then Mr. Buchan has turned Hunter Global into a vehicle for his private wealth, with one main fund that is closed to outside investors and another that invests in outside funds.But people who know Mr. Buchan well say that making the rounds at polo tournaments, cultivating truffles and heirloom tomatoes at his estate in the Hudson Valley and putting the work in to become a certified master sommelier (while also tending to his diminished hedge fund) is not going to satisfy him.Going back to the 1990s, when he was a junior investment banker at Merrill Lynch pitching companies and governments in Argentina and Colombia on banking deals, Mr. Buchan has always had a distant ambition to represent the United States in a Spanish-speaking land, said people who have worked with him.Now all he has to do is wait \u2014 and hope.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dysfunction and Deadlock at the Federal Election Commission", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIt pains me to report that the agency remains dysfunctional, more so than ever, as I prepare to depart at the end of this month as my term nears its end. This is deeply worrisome, because the F.E.C.\u2019s mission is to ensure fairness in elections. One of its core responsibilities is to make sure that all money in political campaigns is disclosed. As Justice Louis Brandeis said, sunlight is \u201cthe best of disinfectants.\u201d This quotation graces the street-facing window of the F.E.C.These commissioners have been enabled by the commission\u2019s very structure. By law, no more than three of its six members can be from the same party. Four must agree to begin an investigation.So what we are left with is an agency mandated to ensure transparency and disclosure that is actually working to keep the public in the dark.But in fact, legislative history demonstrates that gridlock was not Congress\u2019s intention. After Watergate, when Americans were outraged by the campaign finance violations of the Nixon administration, Congress established the F.E.C. to enforce the law fairly. The balance of party membership on the commission was seen as its virtue, to prevent partisan enforcement. Commissioners were expected to come to the table in good faith.As we have seen in recent years, that was wishful thinking.When citizens feel that their voice doesn\u2019t matter, that their vote cannot make a difference, and that they are powerless, our democracy is in danger. We should encourage efforts at the state and local level to enact campaign finance and other reforms that enable greater participation in the political life of the community.There are still opportunities to solve the problem of gridlock at the F.E.C. The terms of all five of my fellow commissioners have expired; they are now serving in what\u2019s known as \u201choldover status.\u201d President Trump is thus in the position to appoint a commission with members who believe in the agency\u2019s mission and purpose and who will enforce the law.The judiciary also has a role to play. If the commission deadlocks on an enforcement action, the aggrieved party is entitled to seek a judicial review. Unfortunately, courts have routinely deferred to the three commissioners who decline to move forward \u2014 deeming them the \u201ccontrolling bloc.\u201d This deference is undue, and further undermines Congress\u2019s intent for fair administration of the law. Courts should account for the views of the commissioners who sought to address wrongdoing \u2014 not just the views of those who consistently obstruct.Only then will our country be protected from the scandalous federal inaction that we now see.Advertisement"}

But when it comes to finance, instead of trying to overthrow traditional players, start-ups have instead begun working with them.What\u2019s the difficulty? There are a few factors:\u2022 Start-ups have not managed to displace banks, even as financial services change rapidly.\u2022 Banks are absorbing new ideas from the world of technology.\u2022 The venture capitalists who invested billions of dollars in new financial technology are still waiting for a breakout star.Post-crisis regulations had forced lenders to reduce their risks, providing an opening for companies willing to fill the gap.Bad behavior at Uber had, until this week, only been whispered about in Silicon Valley.Then Susan Fowler, an engineer who left the company in December, published a blog post detailing discrimination and sexual harassment by her managers, which she said was shrugged off by the human resources department.An internal investigation has been opened: The board member Arianna Huffington and the former United States attorney general Eric H.

SolarCity said that the lawyer had been mistaken in his numbers.If his figures are correct, however, SolarCity could be facing a threat to its financial performance that it had not disclosed to the government or to investors.In either case, the situation raises questions about how well the company vets its potential customers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Your Money Last as Long as You Do", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringHow long should you plan to live?No one can really know, of course. But the answer to that question may be the most critical factor in making a successful financial plan for retirement.And those figures are only averages, said Vickie Bajtelsmit, a professor of finance at Colorado State University whose research focuses on retirement and financial planning. Working with Social Security Administration mortality data, Professor Bajtelsmit calculated that a 65-year-old man has a 20 percent chance to live to 90, and the odds jump to 30 percent if he is in better-than-average health.Meanwhile, she concluded, 31 percent of women who reach age 65 will make it to 90. And for those with better health, the figure is 42 percent.Those odds produce what experts call longevity risk, which is the danger of exhausting resources before the end of life. The risk is significant even for more affluent households, Professor Bajtelsmit said.\u201cThe problem is especially large for widows over age 85,\u201d she said, because income typically falls by roughly one-third after the death of a spouse.Some expenses also fall with only one person still alive, especially for food and medical care. Yet 14.5 percent of widowed women over age 65 live in poverty, according to Social Security Administration data; the figures are higher for divorced women (17.1 percent) and those who never married (23.2 percent).The most conservative retirement plan assumes that you will live to 100, Mr. Vernon said, but there are trade-offs if you take that approach. \u201cEven though I may want my money to last a long time, I also might want to spend money in the early years of retirement, while I\u2019m healthy enough to enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very personal choice.\u201dAn aggressive target also can paralyze people, Professor Bajtelsmit said, adding: \u201cIf you make the target too hard, a lot of people will throw up their hands and say they can\u2019t do it, and they won\u2019t try at all.\u201dDespite the uncertainty, experts offer several steps for mitigating longevity risk:Social Security benefits are calculated using a formula called the primary insurance amount, or P.I.A. Although you can claim benefits as young as 62, by waiting until your full retirement age (currently 66), you\u2019ll receive 100 percent of P.I.A.; every 12 months that you delay beyond that point, until age 70, tacks on an additional 8 percent. And benefits are protected from inflation by the program\u2019s annual cost-of-living adjustment.How is it an investment, exactly? \u201cSay I claim Social Security at 70 instead of 66,\u201d Mr. Tomlinson explained. \u201cThe cost is the amount I give up by claiming later, and the payoff is the difference in annual income when I do claim later on.\u201dBut it also reduces the number of years you will need to spend drawing down your nest egg, and perhaps adds more years of saving. Even part-time work can make a big difference, Mr. Vernon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very effective strategy for people in their early 60s,\u201d he added.Mr. Tomlinson created a custom projection for The New York Times that illustrates the challenges of managing longevity risk with savings alone (see accompanying chart). A key finding: even retirees with sizable savings face significant risk of exhausting their accounts during their lifetimes. Relying on the so-called Monte Carlo method of risk simulation, which analyzes thousands of possible outcomes, Mr. Tomlinson found that a hypothetical couple who had managed to amass $1 million in 401(k) and I.R.A. accounts, and whose annual expenses for essentials would reach $70,000 , faced a 47 percent chance that their retirement plan would \u201cfail\u201d during their lifetimes, assuming they retired at age 65 and claimed Social Security benefits then.Failure means a forced, sharp cut in living standards. Those whose plans fall into that unfortunate 47 percent \u201cwill, on average, fall short of being able to pay for essentials by $168,000 over their lifetimes,\u201d Mr. Tomlinson said. And that\u2019s without considering any high-cost emergency expenses, like home repairs or uninsured medical costs.Waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security brings the risk of failure down to 38 percent. And, just as important, the magnitude of the corresponding lifetime shortfall is much smaller: $58,000.Annuities come in many flavors, but Mr. Tomlinson and other experts who study longevity risk recommend sticking with the most basic types. A single-premium immediate annuity is a straightforward proposition: You plunk down a lump sum of cash and begin receiving payments immediately. Or, pay a much smaller premium for a deferred-income annuity, which begins payments at a future date.Many retirement planning experts view income annuities as a sensible component to add to a retirement plan. The Obama administration tried to encourage their use in I.R.A. and 401(k) plans by approving rules in 2015 for a new type of deferred-income annuity, called a qualified longevity annuity contract, which can be held in a retirement account but excludes its value from required minimum distributions. Legislation approved late last year by the Senate Finance Committee would further encourage the availability of annuities in workplace plans, by limiting plan sponsor liability in the event of an insurance carrier failure.Mr. Carey co-founded Abaris to help address those retirees\u2019 objections. The company built a technology platform aimed at making it simpler and less expensive to buy income annuities; it focuses mainly on deferred-income annuities, which require less upfront investment, and specifically target longevity risk.In return for a smaller investment, lifetime payouts of deferred-income annuities begin only if the buyer lives to a certain age. For example, a $100,000 purchase of a deferred-income annuity by a 65-year-old man, with income starting 10 years later, would generate roughly $14,000 in annual income, according to Abaris.Mr. Tomlinson is skeptical about deferred-income annuities, arguing that they expose buyers to excessive stock market risk while waiting for the payments to begin. \u201cAll you have to do is manage your portfolio well until you reach age 80 or 85,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is easier said than done.\u201dBut retaining liquidity during retirement has its benefits. \u201cThere could be an investment shock or a long-term care need or high medical expense \u2014 even something as simple as a roof that needs to be replaced,\u201d Professor Bajtelsmit said. \u201cIt might not happen until you\u2019re 80 or 85, but someplace along the line, something will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Out of the Office: More People Are Working Remotely, Survey Finds", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore American employees are working remotely, and they are doing so for longer periods, according to a Gallup survey released on Wednesday.Last year, 43 percent of employed Americans said they spent at least some time working remotely, according to the survey of more than 15,000 adults.That represents a four percentage point increase since 2012, a shift that meets the demands of many job seekers.\u201cEmployees are pushing companies to break down the long-established structures and policies that traditionally have influenced their workdays.\u201dHere is a look at some of the report\u2019s findings.It is not just that more working Americans are working off-site; they\u2019re doing so more often, too.The share who said they spent a day or less a week working remotely shrank substantially from 2012 to 2016, falling to 25 percent from 34 percent.At the same time, the share that reported working remotely four to five days a week grew by nearly the same amount, rising to 31 percent from 24 percent.Although widespread, the shift toward remote work is not universal.Remote work was less common last year than in 2012 for Americans employed in the fields of community and social services; science, engineering and architecture; and education, training and library.Most industries, however, have embraced the idea \u2014 none more rapidly than the finance, insurance and real estate industries. The share of workers in those fields who report working remotely at least sometimes rose eight percentage points, to 47 percent, from 2012 to 2016.In the transportation, computer, information systems and mathematics industries, well over half of employees work remotely some of the time.In 2012, the workers who said they felt most engaged while working remotely were those who spent the least amount of time off-site. By 2016, that was no longer true.Workers who spend none or all of their time out of the office reported feeling equally engaged last year. Those who spent 60 percent to 80 percent of their time away from the office had the highest rates of engagement.\u201cIn spite of the additional time away from managers and co-workers, they are the most likely of all employees to strongly agree that someone at work cares about them as a person, encourages their development and has talked to them about their progress,\u201d Gallup reported.Those who spend three or four days a week working remotely were also the most likely to report thinking that they had a best friend at work and had opportunities for professional growth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scheme Tied to UnitedHealth Overbilled Medicare for Years, Suit Says", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnitedHealth Group, one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, is accused in a scheme that allowed its subsidiaries and other insurers to improperly overcharge Medicare by \u201chundreds of millions \u2014 and likely billions \u2014 of dollars,\u201d according to a lawsuit made public on Thursday at the Justice Department\u2019s request.The accusations center on Medicare Advantage, a program through which people 65 or older agree to join private health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.s, whose costs the government reimburses.The program was created in 2003 after UnitedHealth and other insurers said that managed care could help contain the overall cost of Medicare, which has strained the federal budget by rising faster than the rate of inflation.Instead of slowing Medicare costs, UnitedHealth may have improperly added excess costs in the billions of dollars over more than a decade, according to the lawsuit, which was unsealed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles.A spokesman for UnitedHealth disputed that assertion, saying it was based on faulty interpretations of Medicare rules.\u201cWe reject these more than five-year-old claims and will contest them vigorously,\u201d said the spokesman, Matthew A. Burns. He said the company served millions of Medicare Advantage members and was \u201cproud of the access to quality health care we provided, and confident we complied with the program rules.\u201dInsurers and the federal government have been at odds for years over how private plans bill Medicare. A number of UnitedHealth companies sued the Health and Human Services Department last year, challenging proposed rules for how companies should handle overpayments by Medicare.At the same time, whistle-blowers have filed lawsuits against insurers, claiming they overcharged the programs, and government audits have uncovered a widespread problem with private plans overcharging Medicare over a number of years.The Justice Department\u2019s court notice that it was joining the case involving UnitedHeath was filed by Chad Readler, a lawyer who joined the agency\u2019s civil division as part of the Trump administration. It is intervening in the whistle-blower\u2019s claims about erroneous coding and inflated billing but is not taking part in other claims. The government has 90 days to file its own complaint.The newly public accusations were first made in 2011, when a former UnitedHealth executive, Benjamin Poehling, filed a complaint under the False Claims Act, a federal law that allows private citizens to take legal action when they believe a government program has been defrauded.Such cases are typically filed under seal to give federal or state investigators time to follow up and decide whether to join the litigation. In successful False Claims Act cases, where the government ultimately recovers money, the original whistle-blower receives a portion.Mr. Poehling\u2019s complaint, which was among the documents unsealed on Thursday, named 15 companies as defendants. Of those, the Justice Department told the court it wanted to intervene in the cases involving two, UnitedHealth and WellMed Medical Management, which UnitedHealth acquired in 2011.UnitedHealth Group bilked Medicare out of perhaps billions of dollars by making people look sicker than they were, a whistle-blower suit says.The Justice Department asked the court to grant access to all documents produced while Mr. Poehling\u2019s case against the other defendants proceeds, and it reserved the right to join those cases later.Mr. Poehling was finance director for UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement, a subsidiary that works with the Medicare Advantage program. His complaint describes \u201ca corporate culture that demands and rewards financial success from its employees,\u201d including initiatives to increase a billing practice known as \u201crisk adjustment.\u201dThe federal government has allowed people to receive Medicare benefits through private H.M.O.s for decades as an alternative to conventional fee-for-service Medicare.Medicare initially paid the H.M.O.s a fixed rate per member, no matter what chronic conditions members had. That made the H.M.O.s avoid signing up unhealthy people, because they required more care, reducing the companies\u2019 profits.The approach changed in 2003, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services added a \u201crisk adjustment factor\u201d to its reimbursement schedules for managed care. That made H.M.O.s more willing to sign up unhealthy people, but it also gave them a new incentive: to make people appear sicker than they were. UnitedHealth had a unit that helped its subsidiaries and other insurance companies perform risk adjustment calculations.Mr. Poehling said that he and other employees were given \u201crisk adjustment\u201d targets and their performance was evaluated based on how well they achieved them. In a 2008 performance review, for example, he was judged on whether he had increased risk scores by 3 percent.\u201cThere were no similar performance goals for the overall accuracy of risk adjustment submissions,\u201d he wrote in his complaint. \u201cNor was there any accountability assigned for reducing the number of false claims\u201d submitted to the Medicare program for reimbursement.Attached to his complaint was an email message from his division\u2019s chief financial officer, Jerry Knutson, urging staff members \u201cto really go after the potential risk scoring that you have consistently indicated is out there.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s turn on the gas!\u201d Mr. Knutson wrote. \u201cWhat can we do to make sure we are being reimbursed fairly for the members and risk we take on more than what we are currently doing.\u201cWhen we meet next on our steering committee, I\u2019d like to see what it would take to add another $1OOM to our 2008 revenue from where we are. What would be doable? What resources would you need? What technology would you need?\u201dMedicare Advantage\u2019s rules require that for patient care to qualify for risk adjustment factors, a patient\u2019s condition must be verified in person on a regular basis by a qualified professional.But Mr. Poehling said that coding specialists would instead mine patient records, looking for hints of a possible long-term condition. When they found one, they would request the higher payment without going through the required in-person evaluation.The realization that medical records could be mined for extra money appears to have given rise to a cottage industry of consulting firms offering to screen patient histories and look for indications of long-term health problems that could be used to increase Medicare reimbursements.Federal audits of the Medicare Advantage program have suggested that H.M.O.s have driven Medicare costs higher, but a federal effort to issue tighter rules in 2014 was unsuccessful. The proposed rules were withdrawn, and UnitedHealth subsequently sued.An article on Friday about the Justice Department\u2019s joining a whistle-blower lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group misstated the given name of the chief financial officer for a division of UnitedHealth. He is Jerry Knutson, not Jeffrey.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Victory for Trump Is a Victory for Big-Name Traders", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCarl C. Icahn is one of several billionaire investors who have bet big on a Donald J. Trump presidency.So bullish was Mr. Icahn that he said he made $1 billion worth of bets in the stock market the morning after Mr. Trump won the election.In a regulatory filing on Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Icahn, 80, revealed some of the other bets he made in the last three months of 2016. He loaded up on shares of his company, Icahn Enterprises, which invests in a variety of industries. Mr. Icahn also increased his position in Herbalife, the beleaguered vitamin supplements company in which he already owned more than 20 percent of the outstanding shares.Mr. Icahn\u2019s stock trading since the election has interested some Democratic senators, who recently raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest given his role as a special adviser to Mr. Trump on overhauling regulation.It is not just Mr. Icahn who is betting big on Mr. Trump. More broadly, Wall Street has turned bullish in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, pinning its hopes on a new administration \u2014 with a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 delivering big tax cuts and rolling back regulation.The American stock market has risen to a record high even as the White House has come under scrutiny for a ban on immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries \u2014 blocked while the matter is argued in court \u2014 and the resignation on Monday of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser over concerns about conversations he had with Russian officials before Mr. Trump was sworn into office.In the months since the election, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index has soared about 9 percent. Banks and other financial stocks have risen about 20 percent, while industrial stocks, including manufacturing and construction firms, have risen about 11 percent. Consumer company shares have gained roughly 9 percent.Mr. Icahn was one of hundreds of hedge fund and other investment fund managers to make their quarterly declarations to the S.E.C. about which stocks they bought in recent months. Known as 13-Fs, these reports offer investors a glimpse at where these professional traders placed their bets during a given quarter, though they are filed roughly 45 days after the quarter ends.But the filings offer an imperfect window into the holdings of money managers because they are a snapshot of the past. They include only stocks traded in the United States but do not include short positions, or bets a manager might have made that a stock will fall in price. They also do not include bets on the future direction of the market, a favorite trade of Mr. Icahn and his firm.This time, however, the regulatory filings reveal the big rush of money into the market over a quarter that coincided with Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory.Many of the hedge fund managers jumping on the so-called \u201cTrump Bump\u201d trade loaded up on financial stocks in the final quarter of the year, riding shares of banks like Goldman Sachs Group, which are up more than 37 percent since the election, and Bank of America, which has had a more than 40 percent gain over the same period. Some of the big-name managers whose firms added stakes in financial stocks in the final months of 2016 included Daniel S. Loeb, Julian Robertson, David Tepper and O. Andreas Halvorsen.Nelson Peltz\u2019s firm, Trian Fund Management, took a big 4.86 percent stake in Procter & Gamble, one of the largest manufacturers of family, personal and household care products. Mr. Peltz has a reputation as an activist investor who takes stake in companies and then pushes for corporate changes to increase shareholder value. His firm also added shares of Bank of New York Mellon.Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage finance firms that the federal government placed in conservatorship during the financial crisis, also have surged since Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Shares of Fannie, for instance, are up more than 160 percent. The rally has been prompted in part by comments from Steven T. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary and a former hedge fund manager.Mr. Mnuchin said he favored the recapitalization of the two firms and would plan to cut the government\u2019s hold over them. Mr. Mnuchin, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, made those comments a day after Mr. Trump nominated him.His early comments on Fannie and Freddie were welcome news to a group of hedge fund managers, like Paulson & Co. and William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management, that bet on mortgage finance firms.

{"Headline": "At 35, Canadian Ski Racer Is Finding His Groove", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. MORITZ, Switzerland \u2014 Erik Guay believes that downhill ski racers can improve with age.He would know. At 35, Guay became the oldest skier to win a world championship title, charging to a gold medal in the super-G at the Alpine World Ski Championships this week.\u201cIt\u2019s always taken me a bit of time to get comfortable with some things,\u201d Guay said.Brimming with confidence and free of injury, he is looking to add a downhill victory on the 2,774-meter Corviglia course on Saturday.\u201cAnything is possible, absolutely,\u201d Guay said of the speed event double. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a certain amount of pressure come Saturday. I think I\u2019m going to have to ski again with a free spirit. You need intensity, but you also have to be relaxed on the way down.\u201dGuay, a resident of Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, was the men\u2019s world downhill champion in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, in 2011. If he achieves another downhill win in St. Moritz, he will join the ski racing greats Jean-Claude Killy, Toni Sailer, Bernhard Russi, Zeno Col\u00f2 and Aksel Lund Svindal, each of whom has two downhill world championships.Guay, the father of three daughters, is the most decorated Canadian racer in World Cup history, with 24 career medals.He has been working to regain his form since two knee operations wiped out his 2014-15 season.\u201cI\u2019ve had a strange career with a lot of missed time, a lot of injuries and a major knee operation, which took me out for well over a year,\u201d Guay said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a building process \u2014 my body is a lot better, I\u2019ve changed my training techniques, I\u2019m not hurting anymore and I\u2019m able to run again.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m 35 anymore, I feel like I\u2019m 25,\u201d he added.The American skier Travis Ganong, the 2015 world championship downhill silver medalist and a likely contender on Saturday, agreed that age was an asset for skiers.\u201cIt takes experience as long as you can stay somewhat healthy \u2014 then you can progress every year and also get tactically smarter,\u201d Ganong, 28, said.After Guay\u2019s super-G victory, Lindsey Vonn, 32, congratulated him on Twitter, saying, \u201cAge is only a number.\u201dAdding to Guay\u2019s elation in the super-G was his teammate Manny Osborne-Paradis\u2019s winning a bronze medal on his 33rd birthday. It was the first time that two Canadian Alpine skiers stood together on a world championship podium.Guay called it \u201ca little bit of a fairy tale.\u201dThe Canadian Ski Team racers have persevered, hindered by a lack of financing in recent seasons. They do not have a permanent training base in Europe and bounce around resorts to prepare for competitions.\u201cWe have had a tough time \u2014 I\u2019m hoping this result can help the team and spur on some corporate sponsorships,\u201d Guay said.He is also coming back from a spectacular crash three weeks ago in a downhill event on the Kandahar course in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Charging down the mountain at about 70 miles per hour, Guay appeared to catch an edge just before a jump and went tumbling head over heels. He was fortunate to walk away with only bumps and bruises.\u201cIt\u2019s not always easy, and the best-case scenario is you get back on skis as soon as possible and you sort of forget about it as soon as you can,\u201d Guay said. \u201cIn my case, I had to take a few days off because I was quite sore.\u201dGuay, who has never won a medal at the Olympics despite coming close on three occasions, is looking forward to a fourth Games next winter in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Having started in 224 career World Cup races dating to December 2000, Guay said he realized he was getting close to hanging up his racing skis and boots.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve loved about skiing is traveling all over the world and seeing different places, but now with a family it\u2019s hard to leave home, especially for long periods of time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough on the family when you\u2019re not around, and it\u2019s very tough on me, but it\u2019s part of life. We\u2019ve made a game plan that after the Olympics that we\u2019ll reassess when I\u2019ll retire, but it will not last forever, and then I will be there with them full time.\u201dAfter light snowfall and limited visibility on Friday in St. Moritz, weather conditions appeared favorable for Saturday\u2019s men\u2019s downhill.\u201cI\u2019m feeling great, I like my chances, I\u2019m having fun now and looking forward to the race,\u201d Guay said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apocalypse Now: What\u2019s Behind the Volatile Mood of Today\u2019s American \u2014 and European \u2014 Voters", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Across the world, a spirit of anarchy is in bloom \u2014 an aimless desire to smash the liberal order, with only the distant, inchoate hope that a better world will emerge from the wreckage. That spirit apparently motivated many Trump voters, who didn\u2019t mind that their tribune spoke in clownish generalities, possessed no relevant experience and exhibited an itchy trigger finger. Many of these voters admitted, with little compunction, that they wanted to implant his brash persona in the seat of power to shock the system, because the system deserved a shock. That sentiment inspired Brexit, which passed over warnings of financial doom, and it has transported populists to the cusp of power across Europe. In Pankaj Mishra\u2019s telling, a near identical craving for blind revenge leads confused teenagers to join ISIS. He calls it a \u201cbroader and more apocalyptic mood than we have witnessed before.\u201dThis book presents itself as a \u201chistory of the present.\u201d His premise is that broad swaths of the globe are retracing the past, reliving the same traumas and violent dislocations that accompanied Europe\u2019s transition to modernity in the 18th and 19th centuries. A trauma felt most acutely by the \u201cyoung man of promise\u201d in the countries late arriving to capitalism and Enlightenment, especially Germany and Russia. The prospect of freedom and cultural transformation stirred unachievable expectations, which predictably ended in humiliation and rage. This self-righteous West, Mishra argues, obscures its \u201cown bloody extraordinarily brutal initiation into political and economic modernity,\u201d as it arrogantly presses the rest of the world to make that same difficult progression.There\u2019s more history than present in Mishra\u2019s telling. Just when lessons from the past seem to be building toward a point about ISIS or globalization, he layers on another digression about Dostoyevsky or Ataturk. This tendency can be frustrating \u2014 and one begins to suspect it is a crutch, since our current spate of anarchists, populists and terrorists are so much less theoretically minded and articulate than their antique antecedents. It\u2019s a strange imbalance, but Mishra writes with enough style, energy and incision that he carries the reader through.The antihero of Mishra\u2019s tale \u2014 the prophet who best anticipated the crises of our times \u2014 is Jean Jacques Rousseau. And a primary source of his greatness is his hatred of Voltaire. Mishra paints Voltaire as the archetypal elite intellectual, and the worst villain of them all. Voltaire celebrated reason as society\u2019s highest virtue. That is, he believed that society should reward talent and brains, not inherited titles. He trumpeted trade and consumerism in language that anticipated the 1990s boosters of globalization. His writings and personal example set terms for the liberalism that would ultimately prevail in Europe.All this, in Mishra\u2019s view, makes Voltaire a world historic hypocrite. Mishra charges Voltaire with creating a society that benefited thinkers like himself, at everyone else\u2019s expense. Voltaire preached tolerance but cozied up to authoritarians, especially Catherine of Russia, and apologized for their violent misdeeds. Thanks to his connections, he lived a cosseted life and made a small fortune from financial speculation and the watches he manufactured. Voltaire is portrayed as the spiritual forefather of Davos, Thomas Friedman and all the other clubbable paragons of neoliberalism. Mishra calls him a \u201cpaid-up member of the globally networked elite.\u201dRousseau, the graceless outsider, could see straight through Voltaire\u2019s cosmopolitan suavity \u2014 and he shredded him.More to the point, he understood the underlying pathologies of the rising capitalist civilization that Voltaire championed. The market society, Rousseau warned, would dangerously unmoor individuals. He saw how humans aspired to surpass one another in wealth and status, which meant they were capable of great cruelty. The modern world weakened religion and the family, the emotional buffers that provided comfort. Without these supports, individuals came to depend on the opinions of others for their sense of self-worth, which inflicted terrible cases of insecurity, envy and self-hatred. This, in Mishra\u2019s argument, remains the nub of the world\u2019s problems: \u201cAn existential resentment of other people\u2019s being, caused by an intense mix of envy and sense of humiliation and powerlessness, ressentiment, as it lingers and deepens, poisons civil society and undermines political liberty, and is presently making for a global turn to authoritarianism and toxic forms of chauvinism.\u201dThere\u2019s no doubting Rousseau\u2019s prescience. His criticisms of finance and warnings about inequality are proto-Piketty. But he\u2019s a troubling hero. Isaiah Berlin called him the \u201cgreatest militant lowbrow in history and guttersnipe of genius.\u201d Rousseau celebrated militarism and xenophobia. He unabashedly held up Sparta as his ideal. Mary Wollstonecraft, and generations of subsequent feminists, have charged him with contributing to misogyny in its modern form. Mishra knows all this and should be far warier of his own attraction to Rousseau \u2014 but that would require him to admit a central lapse in his own argument.Mishra persuasively damns the arrogance of neoliberals, but let\u2019s say a few kind words for neoliberalism. On the whole, thanks to the advance of capitalism, we live in a world with less abject poverty, less disease, less oppression and greater material prosperity. Mishra dwells in the realm of ideas and emotions, which get short shrift in most accounts of global politics. So it\u2019s bracing and illuminating for him to focus on feelings, what he calls \u201cthe wars in the inner world.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t have much to say about the material reality of economics and politics other than angry bromides about the \u201cWestern model\u201d and broad, unsupported statements about stagnation. (A sample of his glibness: He notes that \u201cmost people have found the notions of individualism and social mobility to be unrealizable in practice.\u201d Why then, we might ask, do so many keep trying for it?) Mishra can\u2019t find the redeeming qualities in liberal democracy and he can\u2019t posit anything to replace it with \u2014 which explains why he must resurrect the repulsive Rousseau, brushing aside his least appealing ideas. Like Rousseau, Mishra sympathizes with traditional society. But it\u2019s impossible to defend traditional societies without accounting for their misogyny and xenophobia, which are hardly incidental features. Mishra can\u2019t bring himself to make the case, which means he has no hint of prescription for the crisis he dedicates his book to describing.When the galleys of \u201cAge of Anger\u201d arrived, I dived for them. They slipped through the mail slot just after the Trump victory rocked my own faith in progress. Liberalism has no choice but to sincerely wrestle with its discontents, to become reacquainted with its moral blind spots and political weaknesses. Technocracy \u2014 which defines so much of the modern liberal spirit \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a natural grasp of psychology and emotion. But if it hopes to stave off the dark forces, it needs to grow adept at understanding the less tangible roots of anger, the human experience uncaptured by data, the resentments that understandably fester. A decent liberalism would read sharp critics like Mishra and learn.Franklin Foer is a correspondent for The Atlantic and former editor of The New Republic.

{"Headline": "China Names Guo Shuqing, a Rapid-Fire Regulator, to Oversee Troubled Banks", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As a top stock market regulator, Guo Shuqing cemented a reputation as an economic reformer who tried to bring market-oriented changes to China\u2019s fraud-ridden and heavily politicized financial system.Now Mr. Guo has returned to Beijing to tackle an even bigger problem: the murky, debt-laden Chinese banking system.On Friday the state news media said that he was named chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, succeeding Shang Fulin, who had reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. The Chinese commercial news media widely reported and filmed Mr. Guo\u2019s arrival at that agency on Friday morning, where he was greeted by Mr. Shang.Mr. Guo\u2019s appointment offers a sign that China is taking a financial overhaul seriously, though it was made among other moves that could send mixed signals about that commitment. The stakes are high: Experts widely believe that China\u2019s weak financial system is holding back its economy, the world\u2019s second largest.Yet other appointments suggested a commitment to the status quo. The state news media on Friday said the No. 2 officials at the National Development and Reform Commission, China\u2019s top economic planning body, and the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees trade, among other things, were named to succeed their retiring bosses, who were also 65.The choice to run the National Development and Reform Commission, He Lifeng, served from 2009 to 2012 as the deputy secretary of Tianjin. He helped oversee the construction of a forest of office and residential skyscrapers at the city\u2019s fringes that have barely been occupied and have become one of the many symbols of China\u2019s dependence on investment-led growth that is often wasteful.China could signal its commitment to a financial overhaul with any changes at the top of its central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China. Zhou Xiaochuan, widely considered a reformist voice in China, is more than two years past retirement age, so predicting his departure has become a popular parlor game in China\u2019s financial world. Appointing Yi Gang, Mr. Zhou\u2019s deputy, to the top could be seen as an endorsement of Mr. Zhou\u2019s gentle advocacy of reform, though elevating Mr. Yi could also reflect Beijing\u2019s lack of interest in rocking the boat.The shuffle comes at a delicate time for China\u2019s financial leadership. Its competence was called into question in 2015, when conflicting signals contributed to a stock market crash and increased government controls. Experts say either the banking commission or the central bank could get added responsibilities should China try to streamline financial regulation.Mr. Guo faces an immediate challenge in reasserting the authority of the banking commission, also known as the C.B.R.C. Like the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Chinese central bank has clawed away from banking regulators a considerable part of their authority to oversee whether banks are lending prudently. The Chinese central bank has also played an increasingly critical role in fighting money laundering and capital flight.China could tip its hand on that matter after the annual gathering of the National People\u2019s Congress, its top lawmaking body, which begins March 5. It may then hold a top-level financial work conference in April on reorganization that was originally planned for January or February.Some experts viewed the recall of Mr. Guo to Beijing as a sign that policy changes are coming. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a signal for fundamental reforms in China\u2019s financial regulatory framework,\u201d said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.In a country where officials tend to either have political experience in running provinces, or economic and financial experience in working at regulatory agencies and state-controlled banks in Beijing, Mr. Guo is a rare example of someone who has done both. He served as a deputy governor of impoverished Guizhou Province in the late 1990s, then as director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. He then became the chairman of the China Construction Bank, one of China\u2019s four main banks, from 2005.He took the top job at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top stock market regulator, in late 2011, unleashing a fury of reform efforts in just 17 months. Then just as quickly, he was gone, sent south to coastal Shandong Province as the acting governor.Rather than a setback to his career, it was another way to develop his economic and political chops. Within months, he rose to become the governor of Shandong Province, helping clean up the financial sector there.Political analysts had said that Mr. Guo might stay in Shandong and be promoted to Communist Party secretary, the top job, above even the governor.Previous party secretaries of Shandong, a large and economically important province, have sometimes joined the Politburo, a top Communist Party leadership group, and gone on to become vice premiers with broad economic powers. Vice premiers are much more important in China than the governor of the central bank, because the central bank has no political independence in China and answers to the cabinet.Time may be running out for Mr. Guo, who will turn 61 this year. The ministers who run the central bank and the main regulatory commissions typically retire at 65, making it harder for Mr. Guo to do a stint at the banking commission and then move on to another senior position.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tom Price Is Sworn In as Health Secretary Amid Senate Disunity", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, took office on Friday with a promise to fix what he called a \u201cbroken health care system\u201d that was \u201charming Americans and their families.\u201dRepublicans said that Mr. Price, 62, an orthopedic surgeon, would bring a physician\u2019s insights to managing a federal agency that they said had become addicted to heavy-handed federal regulation and blind to problems spawned by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\u201cDr. Price has a thorough understanding of health care policy and the damage that Obamacare has caused,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, where consumers this year saw rate increases averaging 44 percent to 62 percent in the law\u2019s marketplace.Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee, said Mr. Price would be \u201can excellent partner\u201d as Congress tries to devise a replacement for the health care law championed by former President Barack Obama.Senate Democrats and the chamber\u2019s two independents said they feared the worst, based on Mr. Price\u2019s 12-year record as a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Georgia. They said that Mr. Price had led efforts to repeal the health care law and slow the growth of Medicare and Medicaid by shifting some costs to beneficiaries and trimming payments to some health care providers.\u201cThis is a sad evening,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cPeople will look back and say that the Republicans\u2019 war on seniors began at 2 a.m. Friday morning when the Senate unfortunately confirmed Representative Price.\u201dThe depth of concern about Mr. Price was illustrated by the comments of Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats but is not given to hyperbole.\u201cTo put somebody in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services that is inimical to Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 this guy is a wrecking ball,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cHe is not a secretary. He is going into this agency to destroy it. He wants to undercut and diminish and, in some cases, literally destroy some of the major underpinnings of providing health care to people in this country.\u201dBy contrast, at the swearing-in ceremony, the vice president said Mr. Price had emerged as \u201cthe most principled expert on health care policy in the House of Representatives, if not the entire Congress.\u201dMr. Trump said again on Friday that the Affordable Care Act was \u201ca total and complete disaster.\u201d With the confirmation of Mr. Price, he said, the administration will \u201cget down to the final strokes,\u201d devising a plan that can provide \u201ctremendous health care at a lower price.\u201dIn a farewell address to the House submitted for publication in the Congressional Record, Mr. Price said that, as chairman of the Budget Committee, he had begun an important effort to \u201cfix our nation\u2019s broken health care system\u201d and \u201cget Washington out of the way\u201d of patients and doctors.One of the first challenges facing the new secretary is to stabilize insurance markets and decide the future of financial assistance provided to insurance companies that say they have lost large amounts of money treating patients under the Affordable Care Act.A judge on the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled on Thursday that the Obama administration had illegally reneged on a promise to pay subsidies to an Oregon insurer, Moda Health Plan. Many other insurers have filed similar claims. The Obama administration\u2019s failure to pay the claims was cited as a reason for the collapse of many nonprofit insurance cooperatives created under the Affordable Care Act.The Trump administration has not decided whether to appeal the decision.The next prospective member of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet to be voted on will be Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, on Monday evening.Congressional reaction to Mr. Mnuchin, as to Mr. Price, has been divided along party lines. Republicans have been impressed with the former Goldman Sachs banker\u2019s business acumen, while Democrats have argued forcefully that he is ill-equipped to steer America\u2019s economy.Those divisions were on stark display during Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s confirmation hearing at the Senate Finance Committee last month, when Democrats questioned him over his business record and ultimately boycotted votes on his nomination.Mr. Mnuchin has also been accused by Senate Democrats of lying to Congress when he said during his hearing that OneWest Bank did not engage in the foreclosure practice of \u201crobo-signing\u201d when he was its chief executive. Local news reports suggested that the bank did engage in such practices in some states.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said on Friday that such discrepancies should disqualify Mr. Mnuchin, who she said was unlikely to look out for working-class Americans.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s record to suggest that he would want to stand up to Wall Street,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a speech on the Senate floor. \u201cMr. Mnuchin is the ultimate Wall Street insider.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Wary of Its New Neighbor in Djibouti: A Chinese Naval Base", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDJIBOUTI \u2014 The two countries keep dozens of intercontinental nuclear missiles pointed at each other\u2019s cities. Their frigates and fighter jets occasionally face off in the contested waters of the South China Sea.With no shared border, China and the United States mostly circle each other from afar, relying on satellites and cybersnooping to peek inside the workings of each other\u2019s war machines.But the two strategic rivals are about to become neighbors in this sun-scorched patch of East African desert. China is constructing its first overseas military base here \u2014 just a few miles from Camp Lemonnier, one of the Pentagon\u2019s largest and most important foreign installations.With increasing tensions over China\u2019s island-building efforts in the South China Sea, American strategists worry that a naval port so close to Camp Lemonnier could provide a front-row seat to the staging ground for American counterterror operations in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa.Beyond surveillance concerns, United States officials, citing the billions of dollars in Chinese loans to Djibouti\u2019s heavily indebted government, wonder about the long-term durability of an alliance that has served Washington well in its global fight against Islamic extremism.Just as important, experts say, the base\u2019s construction is a milestone marking Beijing\u2019s expanding global ambitions \u2014 with potential implications for America\u2019s longstanding military dominance.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge strategic development,\u201d said Peter Dutton, professor of strategic studies at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, who has studied satellite imagery of the construction.\u201cIt\u2019s naval power expansion for protecting commerce and China\u2019s regional interests in the Horn of Africa,\u201d Professor Dutton said. \u201cThis is what expansionary powers do. China has learned lessons from Britain of 200 years ago.\u201dChinese officials play down the significance of the base, saying it will largely support antipiracy operations that have helped quell the threat to international shipping once posed by marauding Somalis.\u201cThe support facility will be mainly used to provide rest and rehabilitation for the Chinese troops taking part in escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia, U.N. peacekeeping and humanitarian rescue,\u201d the Defense Ministry in Beijing said in a written reply to questions.In addition to having 2,400 peacekeepers in Africa, China has used its vessels to escort more than 6,000 boats from many countries through the Gulf of Aden, the ministry said. China\u2019s military has also evacuated its citizens caught in the world\u2019s trouble spots. In 2011, the military plucked 35,000 from Libya, and 600 from Yemen in 2015.As China\u2019s navy has assumed these new roles far from home, its commanders have struggled to maintain vessels and resupply them with food and fuel.Capt. Liu Jianzhong, a former political commissar of a Chinese destroyer plying the Gulf of Aden, said the lack of a dedicated port in the region took a toll on personnel forced to spend long stretches at sea.Professor Dutton said Beijing would most likely try to \u201cacclimatize\u201d the world by using the facility for commercial purposes when it begins operating this year and then gradually increase the number and variety of warships that dock there.\u201cIt will be relatively incremental in the forward deployment of naval power. You are not going to see a Yokosuka,\u201d he said, referring to the base for the United States Seventh Fleet in Japan.In its written answers, the ministry said that China was not budging from its \u201cdefensive\u201d military policy and that the base did not indicate an \u201carms race or military expansion.\u201dChina\u2019s decision to establish an overseas military installation comes as little surprise to those who have watched Beijing steadily jettison a decades-old principle of noninterference in the affairs of other countries.The shift is an outgrowth of China\u2019s evolution from an impoverished slumbering introvert to deep-pocketed mercantilist with economic interests across the globe.\u201cNot only will it give them a huge shot in the arm in terms of naval logistics, but it will also strengthen China\u2019s image at home and abroad.\u201dAt the base\u2019s front gate recently, Chinese workers in construction helmets waved away a reporter who tried to ask questions. China\u2019s Defense Ministry declined a request to tour the site.American officials say they were blindsided by Djibouti\u2019s decision, announced last year, to give China a 10-year lease for the land. Just two years earlier, Susan Rice, the national security adviser under President Barack Obama, had flown here to head off a similar arrangement with Russia.If the Pentagon\u2019s current base restrictions are any guide, American and Chinese troops are unlikely to be sharing beers any time soon. American officials, citing possible security threats, keep most personnel confined to the 570-acre rectangle of scrubland, which is a 10-minute drive from the center of Djibouti city. It is a policy that stirs some discontent among those who often spend yearlong stints at Camp Lemonnier without venturing outside.By contrast, French military personnel can often be seen jogging through the city and socializing with locals. Americans who work for the United States Embassy also live in the community and say they feel little threat to their safety.Life on base can be monotonous, broken up by visits to the fitness center or meals at the camp\u2019s Subway sandwich outlet. Capt. James Black, the camp\u2019s commanding officer, said one of his primary challenges was to provide salubrious distractions for those stationed here. The distractions include free Wi-Fi, a movie theater, Texas Hold \u2019em tournaments and the occasional soccer match with Italian and German troops.\u201cWe\u2019re like a landlocked aircraft carrier,\u201d Captain Black said during a recent tour of the installation, which is blasted in summer by broiling heat. \u201cPart of my job is to create opportunities to give people a break and attend to their mental health needs.\u201dLocal residents also crave more face time with the Americans. Some say Camp Lemonnier personnel could play a more active role in helping to alleviate Djibouti\u2019s crushing poverty by building schools, painting hospitals or simply taking part in language exchanges.Others, like Mohamed Ali Basha, the owner of a Yemeni-style restaurant that serves grilled fish and massive discs of baked flatbread, said he would welcome business from military personnel.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the Americans are so obsessed with security here, but I would be happy to close the restaurant for them if they would come,\u201d Mr. Basha, 26, said. \u201cJust call in advance.\u201dCritics say the surge of loans, which amount to 60 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, raises concerns about China\u2019s leverage over the Djibouti government should it fall behind on debt payments.\u201cSuch generous credit is itself a form of control,\u201d said Mohamed Daoud Chehem, a prominent government critic. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what China\u2019s intentions really are.\u201dBut on the city\u2019s dusty, potholed streets, most people are pleased to see China joining the club of a half-dozen foreign militaries that have a presence here, among them Japan, Italy and Britain. Also here is a large contingent of French soldiers who stayed on after 1977, when the colony formerly known as French Somaliland gained independence.Abdirahman M. Ahmed, who runs Green Djibouti International, an environmental social enterprise, said many people viewed foreign militaries as a stabilizing force, given their country\u2019s diminutive size, its lack of resources and the potential threats from neighbors like Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea, where expansionist sentiments continue to burble.\u201cWe don\u2019t see any problem having the Chinese here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey provide revenue and help play a deterrence to those who would love to annex Djibouti.\u201dFor American military strategists, the security implications of the Chinese base are unclear, though practically speaking, many experts say the military threat is minimal.\u201cA port like this isn\u2019t very defensible against attack,\u201d said Philip C. Saunders, director of the Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at the National Defense University. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t last very long in a war.\u201dAndrew Jacobs reported from Djibouti, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

{"Headline": "When Retirement Comes With a Daily Dose of Cannabis", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRuth Brunn finally said yes to marijuana. She is 98.She pops a green pill filled with cannabis oil into her mouth with a sip of vitamin water. Then Ms. Brunn, who has neuropathy, settles back in her wheelchair and waits for the jabbing pain in her shoulders, arms and hands to ebb.\u201cI don\u2019t feel high or stoned,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I know is I feel better when I take this.\u201dMs. Brunn will soon have company. The nursing home in New York City where she lives, the Hebrew Home at Riverdale, is taking the unusual step of helping its residents use medical marijuana under a new program to treat various illnesses with an alternative to prescription drugs. While the staff will not store or administer pot, residents are allowed to buy it from a dispensary, keep it in locked boxes in their rooms and take it on their own.From retirement communities to nursing homes, older Americans are increasingly turning to marijuana for relief from aches and pains. Many have embraced it as an alternative to powerful drugs like morphine, saying that marijuana is less addictive, with fewer side effects.For some people, it is a last resort when nothing else helps.Marijuana, which is banned by federal law, has been approved for medical use in 29 states, including New York, and the District of Columbia. Accumulating scientific evidence has shown its effectiveness in treating certain medical conditions. Among them: neuropathic pain, severe muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis, unintentional weight loss, and vomiting and nausea from chemotherapy. There have also been reports that pot has helped people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other types of dementia as well as Parkinson\u2019s disease.A medical marijuana education and support club started by residents of Rossmoor Walnut Creek, a retirement community east of San Francisco, has grown to 530 members \u2014 so many that it has changed meeting rooms three times.\u201cI would be in a lot worse shape if I wasn\u2019t using cannabis, both physically and mentally,\u201d said Anita Mataraso, 72, a grandmother of six who is the program director and takes marijuana daily for arthritis and nerve pain, among other ailments.\u201cPeople are using it, and we need to know how to respond,\u201d she said.But as older people come to represent an emerging frontier in the use of marijuana for medical purposes, questions are being raised about safety and accessibility. Even in states where medical marijuana is legal, older people who stand to benefit often cannot get it. Most nursing homes do not openly sanction its use, and many doctors are reluctant to endorse pot use, saying not enough is known about the risks in the oldest age groups.While there is no shortage of research on marijuana, relatively little of it has focused explicitly on older users even as their numbers grow \u2014 and not just in the United States. In Israel, for instance, older people have been treated with medical marijuana for years. And Americans for Safe Access, an advocacy group, helped open a research center in the Czech Republic that is evaluating its impact on older people.\u201cOlder people can be more sensitive to medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible a dose safe for a 40-year-old may not be in an 80-year-old.\u201dDr. Thomas Strouse, a psychiatrist and palliative care doctor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that just as sleeping and pain medications could harm older people, marijuana could possibly make them confused, dizzy or more likely to fall.\u201cThere is no evidence that it is particularly helpful to older people, and some reason that it could be harmful,\u201d he said.Most nursing homes have also taken a cautious position, often resorting to a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d approach.\u201cIf residents are taking it, they are taking it undercover without the staff knowing so it\u2019s not part of their care plan,\u201d said Dr. Cheryl Phillips, senior vice president for public policy and health services for LeadingAge, an industry group representing more than 2,000 nursing homes. \u201cI think that creates a safety problem.\u201dFred Miles, a Colorado lawyer who represents nursing home operators, said nursing homes \u2014 unlike assisted living facilities \u2014 were regulated by the federal government, and were fearful of jeopardizing their Medicare and Medicaid funding. Staff members who administer marijuana could also theoretically face criminal prosecution under federal law, he said, though he has never heard of that happening.The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said no nursing home had specifically lost financing or been penalized for permitting the use of marijuana. In New York State, which started a medical marijuana program in 2016, its use is restricted to people with designated medical conditions, including neuropathy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s, H.I.V., AIDS and cancer.At the Hebrew Home in the Bronx, the medical marijuana program was years in the making. Daniel Reingold, the president and chief executive of RiverSpring Health, which operates the home, said he saw its powers firsthand when his own father, Jacob, was dying from cancer in 1999. To ease his father\u2019s pain, Mr. Reingold boiled marijuana into a murky brown tea. His father loved it, and was soon laughing and eating again.\u201cThe only relief he got in those last two weeks was the tea,\u201d Mr. Reingold said.When Mr. Reingold requested approval from the nursing home\u2019s board members, there were no objections or concerns, he said. Instead, they joked that they would have to increase the food budget.Then Dr. Zachary Palace, the medical director, developed a program that seeks to offer marijuana as an option but also comply with federal regulations: Though the nursing home recommends and monitors its use, residents are responsible for buying, storing and administering it themselves.Last fall, the first three residents started taking marijuana pills. Their families obtain the pills at a dispensary in Yonkers run by Etain, a company licensed by the state to sell medical marijuana to qualifying patients or their designated caregivers, who must live in New York. Dr. Palace said that as the program expanded this month, as many as 50 residents could be using marijuana.Marcia Dunetz, 80, a retired art teacher who has Parkinson\u2019s, said she worried at first about what people would think. \u201cIt\u2019s got a stigma,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really believe you\u2019re not really getting high if you take it.\u201dBut she decided to try it anyway. Now, she no longer wakes up with headaches and feels less dizzy and nauseated. Her legs also do not freeze up as often.For Ms. Brunn, the marijuana pills have worked so well that she has cut back on her other pain medication, morphine.Her daughter, Faith Holman, 61, said the pills cost $240 a month, which is not covered by health insurance. Ms. Holman, who lives in New Jersey, also has to ask a family friend to go to the Yonkers dispensary.\u201cObstacles had to be overcome,\u201d Ms. Holman said. \u201cBut I think she was meant to have it because everything has worked out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Battered in Washington, Is Buoyed at Boeing Rally", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 President Trump, seeking to reset his stumbling presidency, hit the road for a photo op and returned to the simple economic message that got him elected, telling aircraft factory workers that \u201cwe\u2019re here to celebrate jobs.\u201dThe president toured a sprawling Boeing complex here, next to the airport, en route to a weekend in Florida that includes a stay at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, and a Saturday rally in Melbourne. Both are the kind of campaign-style events he has often turned to for a political and personal jolt in times of turmoil.\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for every last American job,\u201d said Mr. Trump, adding that his \u201cfocus\u201d was on jobs. He spoke after slowly walking in front of a gleaming new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner at a slickly produced event that erased the lines between corporate and political branding.\u201cGod bless Boeing,\u201d Mr. Trump said after offering a similar benediction for the nation.Swerving from the script loaded into the teleprompter, he joked with Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, about continuing negotiations over the cost of building a new fleet of Air Force One jets (the current models are more than three decades old).\u201cWhat can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane,\u201d he said, as the audience guffawed.He left Washington after a week of humbling setbacks that included the forced withdrawal of his choice for labor secretary and the firing of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, in the wake of reports that Mr. Flynn misled investigators and Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington.Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance at the manufacturing complex, in a state he won by 15 points in November, vividly illustrated the second side of his split-screen presidency. It was a disciplined drumbeat of events, including meetings with labor and business leaders intended to demonstrate his commitment to ensuring working-class economic security. That was the pledge that moved skeptical swing state voters to his cause.\u201cThere\u2019s the palace intrigue story about them not being very well coordinated, that the White House isn\u2019t ready for prime time, that he\u2019s still setting things up,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and frequent Trump critic. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cracks in the armor. And then you have the whole Flynn situation.\u201d\u201cBut you have a very disciplined president when it comes to economic messaging,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who was in Washington on Friday with the Senate in session. \u201cHow can that be? I just think he\u2019s more comfortable talking about how we are going to make America a better place for jobs than he is at articulating foreign policy.\u201dMr. Trump, a president obsessed with optics, could not have chosen a more impressive backdrop to emphasize his commitment to preserving jobs. His staff spent about a week prepping for his visit to the facility here, a six-story factory hangar with four massive Dreamliners under construction, cowlings peeled back to expose the inner workings of the engines, signs affixed to their bodies to indicate their purchasers \u2014 in one case, Aerom\u00e9xico.South Carolina is a so-called right-to-work state, with a low level of union participation. Since it began production here in 2009, Boeing has hired 7,500 employees spread around several facilities, investing more than $2 billion in land and infrastructure, while spending about $355 million each year on local suppliers and vendors, according to the company.\u201cThis is our house, and our house is going to remain union free!\u201d said Joan Robinson-Berry, one of plant\u2019s managers, to the applause of about 2,000 employees and local officials who gathered for the president\u2019s visit.But that was about it for substance or controversy.Mr. Trump has criticized Boeing for what he suggested was an overpriced Air Force One replacement. On Friday, he repeated that \u201cthe price is too high\u201d but also noted that \u201cwe\u2019re negotiating.\u201d Referring to one of Boeing\u2019s major competitors, he said: \u201cWe love Lockheed. Great partner.\u201dThe president also said more explicitly than before that the Pentagon would consider buying more Boeing F/A-18 fighters in place of some of the Lockheed Martin F-35s that it had planned to order if Lockheed does not keep lowering the price of the F-35. \u201cIf the price doesn\u2019t come down, we would,\u201d he said. Now that Boeing has made it somewhat stealthier, he said, \u201cThe F-18\u2019s a great plane.\u201dSome in the president\u2019s own party, including Mr. Graham, had hoped he would use the trip to announce his support for the embattled Export-Import Bank, a financing partner for Boeing and other companies battling foreign-based competitors. He did not.The bank is a New Deal-era institution that helps American companies operating overseas arrange and guarantee loans for international customers. It has jokingly been called \u201cthe Bank of Boeing,\u201d because the Chicago-based aerospace giant has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the bank\u2019s efforts, with as much of a third of Ex-Im financing deals being steered to help the company win contracts against competitors like Europe\u2019s Airbus.Mr. Trump, who promised to drain the Washington \u201cswamp,\u201d did not stake out a position on the bank during the 2016 campaign. But he joined the chorus of conservatives and progressive Democrats \u2014 ranging from Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, to Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont \u2014 who have described the bank as corporate welfare. In one campaign appearance, Mr. Trump called some of the bank\u2019s deals \u201cfeatherbedding.\u201dBut the president has softened his stance considerably since the inauguration, as he has moved his focus from assuaging his party\u2019s base to fulfilling big campaign promises on jobs, trade and manufacturing. In the last few weeks, he told pro-bank senators that he was leaning toward the appointment of new board members, breaking an impasse that has frozen lending and deal-making for more than a year.\u201cThe comments that he did make during the campaign were critical of the bank, and the signal I got was that he was not a supporter,\u201d said Diane Katz, a fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has worked closely with Mr. Trump\u2019s team but opposes the bank as a government intrusion into free markets.\u201cSince taking office, he has emphasized the refashioning of trade deals to benefit U.S. workers and retaining manufacturing, so there seems to be a change,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope he\u2019s not backtracking. Boeing, the primary beneficiary of the bank, has a market cap of almost $150 billion. They don\u2019t need any more corporate welfare.\u201dChristopher Drew contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Phrase Putin Never Uses About Terrorism (and Trump Does)", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president, hardly misses a chance to talk tough on terrorism, once famously saying he would find Chechen terrorists sitting in the \u201couthouse\u201d and \u201crub them out.\u201dHe and President Trump, notably dismissive of political correctness, would seem to have found common language on fighting terrorism \u2014 except on one point of, well, language.During his campaign, Mr. Trump associated Islam with terrorism and criticized President Obama for declining to use the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201dHowever, Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump so openly admires for his toughness, has, for more than a decade, done exactly what President Obama did. He has never described terrorists as \u201cIslamic\u201d and has repeatedly gone out of his way to denounce such language.\u201cI would prefer Islam not be mentioned in vain alongside terrorism,\u201d he said at a news conference in December, answering a question about the Islamic State, a group he often refers to as \u201cthe so-called Islamic State,\u201d to emphasize a distinction with the Islamic religion.In the Middle East, Mr. Putin said at the mosque opening, \u201cterrorists from the so-called Islamic State are compromising a great world religion, compromising Islam, sowing hatred, killing people, including clergy,\u201d and added that \u201ctheir ideology is built on lies and blatant distortions of Islam.\u201dHe was careful to add, \u201cMuslim leaders are bravely and fearlessly using their own influence to resist this extremist propaganda.\u201dAnd, this being Russia, the failure to adhere to this Kremlin-determined interpretation is a prosecutable offense: The Russian news media are required by law to note in any mention of the Islamic State that the reference is to a banned terrorist organization of that name, lest it be misconstrued as denigrating religion.Mr. Putin does not take this stance to soothe the feelings of Western liberals, a group he dismisses as hypocritical in any case.Instead, Russian counterterrorism strategy focused on financing and militarily backing moderate Muslim leaders, with the breakthrough in the Chechen war coming when the region\u2019s imam, Akhmad Kadyrov, allied with the Russian military. His son, Ramzan Kadyrov, leads the region today.While embracing Islamic leaders as a centerpiece of its counterterrorism strategy, however, the Kremlin did not avoid drawing distinctions along religious lines.The Russian government backed the Kadyrov family\u2019s campaign to revive traditional Sufi Islam in Chechnya as a counterweight to the more austere Wahhabi denomination professed by many separatists. The Wahhabi strain was outlawed in another restive, predominantly Muslim province, Dagestan, and its adherents are persecuted in Russia, rights groups say.Still, the alliance with moderate Islamic religious leaders became important in pacifying Chechnya and other North Caucasus regions, which have ceased to pose a serious security threat to Russia.\u201cPutin rules a multiconfessional country,\u201d Orkhan Dzhemal, a commentator on Islamic affairs, said in a telephone interview, noting that in the United States, in contrast, Muslims are not a powerful political force. \u201cHe cannot say \u2018Islamic terrorism\u2019 for a simple reason. He doesn\u2019t want to alienate millions of Russians.\u201dThe term preferred in Russian political parlance is \u201cinternational terrorism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kenneth Arrow, Nobel-Winning Economist Whose Influence Spanned Decades, Dies at 95", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKenneth J. Arrow, one of the most brilliant economic minds of the 20th century and, at 51, the youngest economist ever to win a Nobel, died on Tuesday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 95.His son David confirmed the death.Paul A. Samuelson, the first American to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, called Professor Arrow \u201cthe most important theorist of the 20th century in economics.\u201d When Professor Arrow received the award in 1972, Professor Samuelson wrote, \u201cThe economics of insurance, medical care, prescription drug testing \u2014 to say nothing of bingo and the stock market \u2014 will never be the same after Arrow.\u201dProfessor Arrow \u2014 a member of an extended family of distinguished economists, including Professor Samuelson and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and adviser to President Barack Obama \u2014 generated work that was technically forbidding even to mathematically oriented colleagues.But over the decades, economists have learned to apply his ideas to the modern design of insurance products, financial securities, employment contracts and much more.The backdrop for Professor Arrow\u2019s influential early work was the centuries-long recognition that majority voting can produce arbitrary outcomes.Consider a legislature choosing its leader from among three candidates: Alice, Betty and Harry. If the legislature were to vote first on Alice versus Betty, with the winner running against Harry, it could come to a different decision than had it first started by voting on Alice versus Harry. Because the order with which the legislature takes votes is arbitrary, the ultimate winner of this system of majority voting becomes arbitrary. That puts politics in an awkward corner.In search of nonarbitrary outcomes, social scientists proffered different ways to conduct votes. For example, the legislature could run all three candidates in the initial round and structure some type of runoff. Or the legislature could give each member multiple votes to be assigned to the three candidates in proportion to the intensity of the member\u2019s preferences.But no voting system, however cleverly designed, resolved the problems associated with majority voting. In a theorem of stunning generality, Professor Arrow proved that no system of majority voting worked satisfactorily according to a carefully articulated definition of \u201csatisfactory\u201d (which social scientists generally accept).What Professor Arrow proved in his book \u201cSocial Choice and Individual Values\u201d (1951) was far more sweeping. Not only would majority-voting rules prove unsatisfactory; so, too, would nonvoting systems of making social choices if, as was fundamental to his way of thinking, those choices were based on the preferences of the individuals making up the society. (Professor Arrow\u2019s rules did not allow for dictators.)The Arrow \u201cimpossibility theorem\u201d ricocheted around the social sciences, noteworthy for its use of abstract mathematical concepts to generate a conclusion of sweeping applicability.Professor Arrow\u2019s research opened the academic field of social choice \u2014 a literature that ranges from countries picking presidents to corporate boards picking business strategies. Having learned from him that no system works entirely well, academics turned to challenging follow-up questions, like whether some voting systems were better than others.Professor Arrow\u2019s next major contributions, for which he shared the 1972 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science with the British economist John R. Hicks, were published later in the 1950s. They took a bird\u2019s-eye, \u201cgeneral equilibrium\u201d view of market economies, setting out equations to capture the interplay between consumers and producers.The basic equations had been set out a half-century earlier by the French economist Leon Walras. But Professor Arrow and his co-authors extended the Walrasian system to capture important complexities, like the fact that markets exist well into the future, posing risk for consumers and producers.Professor Arrow proved that their system of equations mathematically cohere: Prices exist that bring all markets into simultaneous equilibrium (whereby every item produced at the equilibrium price would be voluntarily purchased). And market competition puts society\u2019s resources to good use: Competitive markets are efficient, in the language of economists.Professor Arrow\u2019s theorems set out the precise conditions under which Adam Smith\u2019s famous conjecture in \u201cThe Wealth of Nations\u201d holds true: that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of market competition among self-serving individuals serves society well.As was true of his earlier work on social choice, the magnitude of Professor Arrow\u2019s theoretical insight was staggering. But, he made clear, his powerful conclusions about the workings of competitive markets held true only under ideal \u2014 that is to say, unrealistic \u2014 assumptions.His assumptions, for example, ruled out the existence of third-party effects: The sale of a product by Harry to Joe was assumed not to affect the well-being of Sally \u2014 an assumption routinely violated in the real world by, for example, the sale of products that harm the environment.The mathematics behind the general equilibrium proofs of Professor Arrow and his co-authors were daunting. Few economists mastered the details. But Franklin M. Fisher, who taught graduate courses on general equilibrium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, acknowledged in a 2013 interview with The New York Times that all academic economists were in Professor Arrow\u2019s intellectual debt. Professor Arrow proved that the economists\u2019 workaday tools of supply-and-demand equations are built on a logically coherent foundation.His later research translated common-sense ideas into elegant mathematics. Once the ideas were translated, other economists could extend them in unanticipated directions.Take \u201clearning by doing,\u201d a notion that Professor Arrow examined in the early 1960s. The basic idea is straightforward: The more that a company produces, the smarter it gets. Decades later, economists incorporated this idea into sophisticated theories of \u201cendogenous growth,\u201d which have a country\u2019s rate of economic growth depending on internal policies that promote innovation and education \u2014 the very forces that Professor Arrow\u2019s writings anticipated.Professor Arrow also created mathematical concepts by which economists could measure and analyze risk. William F. Sharpe, who won a Nobel in 1990 for analyzing the relationship between financial risk and return, credited Professor Arrow with helping to formulate the basis for modern theories of financial investment and corporate finance.Professor Arrow, he said, belonged in the \u201cpantheon\u201d of investment management. His ideas have worked their way into the design of complicated financial securities, known as derivatives, like options (which give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified asset at a specified price on or before a specified date). Businesses buy and sell financial derivatives to protect themselves from financial turmoil, and investors buy and sell them to speculate on future movements of security prices.Professor Arrow anticipated the modern analysis of markets in which buyers and sellers do not share accurate information (now known as markets with asymmetric information). In a strikingly prescient article published in the early 1960s, he teased apart the complexities that asymmetric information creates in the market for health insurance. He pointed to incentives for patients and their physicians to agree to medical procedures of questionable value when a third party, the insurer, pays the bills.Professor Arrow\u2019s work spawned the modern treatment of \u201cmoral hazard,\u201d whereby the fact of the purchase of insurance systematically affects the behavior of the parties to the contract.Joseph Stiglitz, who won the Nobel in 2001 for formalizing the study of markets with incomplete information, traces his work to Professor Arrow\u2019s initial forays.The upshot? The theorist who in the 1950s proved that perfectly competitive markets could exist as a matter of mathematical logic spent much of the rest of his career showing how far short of perfection actual markets fall.Kenneth Joseph Arrow was born on Aug. 23, 1921, in New York City. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan, he raced through City College, finishing with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social science and in mathematics \u2014 what he called later \u201ca paradoxical combination that was prognostic of my future interests.\u201dHe did his graduate work at Columbia University, interrupting it to serve as a weather officer, rising to captain, in the Army Air Corps during World War II. His first published paper, \u201cOn the Optimal Use of Winds for Flight Planning,\u201d drew on this experience.Early in his career he worked at the RAND Corporation, the research and development organization in Santa Monica, Calif., in what he described as \u201cthe heady days of emerging game theory and mathematical programming.\u201dProfessor Arrow spent the bulk of his career at Stanford University, except for a teaching stint at Harvard from 1968 to 1979. He also served briefly on the staff of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.He retired from Stanford in 1991 but continued to accept short-term appointments in Europe and to serve on the external faculty and the science board of the Santa Fe Institute, a research center in New Mexico focused on the interplay of the social and physical sciences.He led the American Economic Association, served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and, in 2004, was awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation\u2019s highest scientific honor, presented in 2006 by President George W. Bush.\u201cHis politics are liberal, definitely,\u201d said Robert M. Solow, a longtime friend and fellow Nobel laureate in economics. \u201cWith other people, this might rub the right half of the economics profession the wrong way, but it doesn\u2019t with Kenneth.\u201dRobert Summers was the brother of Paul Samuelson and the father of Lawrence Summers, who at 28 became a tenured economics professor at Harvard and later served as the Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, as well as president of Harvard and senior adviser to Mr. Obama.Professor Arrow\u2019s wife, the former Selma Schweitzer, whom he married in 1947, died in 2015. Besides his sister and son David, he is survived by another son, Andrew, and a grandson.Professor Arrow was widely hailed as a polymath, possessing prodigious knowledge of subjects far removed from economics. Eric Maskin, a Harvard economist and fellow Nobel winner, told of a good-natured conspiracy waged by junior faculty to get the better of Professor Arrow, even if artificially. They all agreed to study the breeding habits of gray whales \u2014 a suitably abstruse topic \u2014 and gathered at an appointed date at a place where Professor Arrow would be sure to visit.When, as expected, he showed up, they were talking out loud about the theory by a marine biologist \u2014 last name, Turner \u2014 which purported to explain how gray whales found the same breeding spot year after year. As Professor Maskin recounted the story, \u201cKen was silent,\u201d and his junior colleagues amused themselves that they had for once bested their formidable professor.Well, not so fast.Before leaving, Professor Arrow muttered, \u201cBut I thought that Turner\u2019s theory was entirely discredited by Spencer, who showed that the hypothesized homing mechanism couldn\u2019t possibly work.\u201dRobert D.

He was elected to the Senate the same year.The woman who succeeded him on the Council, Inez Dickens, was elected last year to the State Assembly, creating a vacancy in Mr. Perkins\u2019s old seat. She would have been prevented by term limits from running for re-election to the Council. State elected officials do not face term limits.Mr. Perkins said that he felt he could be more effective on the Council than in the Senate, where he was in the Democratic minority.\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy place to be in the minority,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a legislative body where majority rules, you\u2019re basically being ruled.\u201dThere are other financial factors as well that may influence legislators looking to make the jump. Moving to the Council with its higher salary could mean a boost in future pension payments. The 51 Council members also receive generous discretionary funds that they can spend in their districts.On the other hand, state legislative jobs are considered part time and lawmakers are allowed to hold outside employment. The City Council bans many types of outside income, however, so some state legislators could potentially see a reduction in income if they were required to give up other jobs. Such outside income, however, has been a frequent cause of ethical scandals, helping to bring down legislative leaders like Sheldon Silver.Senator Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr. of the Bronx said that he was considering a run for the City Council seat held by Annabel Palma, who cannot run again because of term limits.\u201cI\u2019m going to give you a few reasons, and one of them is not money,\u201d he said, bringing up the issue of pay without prompting.Mr. Diaz, 73, who also previously served on the Council, said that the discretionary funds given to Council members would position him to better help the people of his district.\u201cI\u2019d rather be in a place that I could help my community better, where I could help senior citizens, where I could help Little League, where I could help community groups,\u201d he said.He also said that he recently had back surgery and that at his age, the frequent drives to Albany had become difficult for him. He says that he will make a decision after a state budget is passed.Assemblyman Robert Rodriguez has raised $21,860 for a city campaign, according to a January filing with the City Campaign Finance Board, and he said that he was considering a run for the seat of the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, in East Harlem and the Bronx. Ms. Mark-Viverito cannot run again because of term limits.Mr. Rodriguez also works as a financial adviser and might not gain financially by moving to the Council, where he would have to give up his outside job.Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a good government advocacy group, said that, pay aside, the City Council functions much better than the State Senate or Assembly, thanks to years of ethical and legislative reforms.\u201cWhat we see is that when you have an appropriate pay level with correct restrictions on outside income and a more robust, functioning legislative process, combined with a well-thought-out and well-executed public campaign finance system, you attract talented candidates and some of them may be people who are sitting in other bodies,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cWhen you put all these factors together it\u2019s attractive to be a City Council member.\u201dIn Albany, she said, most of the activity happens behind closed doors.\u201cIf you are a public spirited community member or a legislator, it is not irrational to think that you can get more done in the City Council,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cYou can have a more direct impact.\u201dIn the Bronx, Assemblyman Mark Gjonaj has raised $103,000 to run for the Council seat that will be vacated by James Vacca, who faces a term limit.\u201cThis particular move for me is not focused on the salary,\u201d Mr. Gjonaj said. He said that he was interested in local issues like \u201cpotholes, streetlights, policing, litter,\u201d and that his Albany experience was also a plus because the city depended so much on decisions made in the State Legislature.But John Doyle, a City Island resident who is raising money to run against Mr. Gjonaj in the Democratic primary, described the state capital as an ethical cesspool and said that he intended to make an issue of Mr. Gjonaj\u2019s tenure there.\u201cI imagine that Albany will be very much a factor in our race,\u201d Mr. Doyle said.Mr. Doyle says that if he is elected he will refuse to take the new, higher salary that the Council voted itself last year, which he called \u201cobscene.\u201d He said that he would donate the difference between the old and new salaries to charity, or use it to pay his staff.\u201cLeadership is about shared sacrifice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re running for office, it\u2019s not about the money so people should agree to personally not take the pay increase.\u201dMr. Gjonaj said he would use some money from the raise to augment the discretionary funds he would spend in his district.The wide salary differential has become the source of running jokes in Albany and New York City, according to Senator Kevin S. Parker of Brooklyn.Mr. Parker, who is not considering a run for the Council, says that his Brooklyn councilman, Jumaane D. Williams, is a friend and that they sometimes laugh over the difference in pay.\u201cI joke with Jumaane that I\u2019m going to run against him \u2014 I need the pay raise,\u201d Mr. Parker said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not the money, we do it for the service.

{"Headline": "They Came to Ski Idaho Slopes. Now They\u2019re Saving the Ski Resort.", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDONNELLY, Idaho \u2014 There is an old joke in the ski industry that a resort needs to go bankrupt three times before it can be profitable. Tamarack is hoping to get away with just once.Today the resort looks like the physical manifestation of a big idea never executed. There is a towering crane that hasn\u2019t moved anything in years. The ski shop and restaurants are open, but sit in dome-shaped buildings that the original investors intended to be temporary. The permanent village sits nearby, half-built and covered in white Tyvek, as it has been since 2008.And instead of chill vacations on the slopes, the group of mostly part-time residents who bought homes and condos around the resort have spent the years since Mr. Boespflug\u2019s disappearance trying to save their mountain from creditors.A small mountain supermarket has opened, closed, reopened and closed again. At one point a group of repo men used a helicopter to take back a ski lift.But now, after a decade of springs that began with a question of whether the resort would open the following winter, Tamarack has some semblance of stability. The debt pile has been cleared, and in October homeowners banded together to buy the resort\u2019s operations.With things looking up, Angela and Mark Gustafson are doubling down. Last summer, two years after buying a townhome with views of the half-built village, they moved to a larger home near a golf course on the other side of the resort.The timing wasn\u2019t perfect: The golf course was recently returned to nature after its owner walked away. But Mrs. Gustafson remains confident that better days are ahead.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have upgraded to a bigger home if we didn\u2019t have faith in a resurrection,\u201d she said.Tamitude means things like accepting that everyone who works here will have more than one job. In addition to being general manager, Mr. Larsen is the resort\u2019s marketing director, food and beverage manager, staff photographer, videographer and wedding salesman.He walks around at night turning the heat down in empty buildings. Sometimes he cleans toilets and buses tables at the restaurants.This a long way from Mr. Larsen\u2019s last job at Telluride Ski Resort, where he was vice president for sales and marketing. He had an office overlooking the village and \u201cdefinitely didn\u2019t clean bathrooms.\u201d But he has come to relish the turnaround and got gushy with Western spirit while describing how he spent the summer cutting ski trails through the forest, then skied them the following winter.\u201cSo many men and women in the ski business have looked up the mountain and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to make this place incredible,\u2019\u201d he said over dinner. \u201cBut like those men and women, you have to hack your way through the wilderness.\u201dAnd while there has been lots of recent progress, it seems unlikely that Tamarack will fulfill the original idea of a high-end resort for skiers flying in from around the world.Mostly there is a sense of comfort that whatever the resort ends up being, its destiny belongs to people who live and ski here instead of some faceless banks.\u201cIt gives a sense of stability, not just to the resort but to the community,\u201d said Ken Roberts, chairman of the Idaho Tax Commission and a farmer whose family has been in Donnelly for more than a century. \u201cYou now have owners who have a vested interest in seeing it being successful.\u201dAnd there are worse things than living next to a newly built resort where the lift lines range from small to nonexistent. On a recent morning between runs, Steve Bussolini, 67, a retired college administrator who lives in nearby McCall, joked that the parking lot is so empty that he never has to walk more than 25 steps before putting his skis on.He was disappointed when Tamarack\u2019s Wildwood lift was repossessed by Bank of America in 2012. But then he found a path through the trees and discovered lots of fresh powder.\u201cIt makes for better skiing,\u201d he said.Mr. Boespflug and his investors started building the resort in 2002. Real estate was booming, so they financed the construction with hundreds of millions of dollars in home and condo sales, and by 2004 the ski lifts were up and running.The hope for new jobs was why Brad Backus, a Tamarack ski guide who also served as Donnelly\u2019s mayor, gave the town a new motto \u2014 \u201cCrossroads to Recreation\u201d \u2014 that is etched onto the granite sign announcing your arrival.That vision seemed in doubt in the winter of 2008, when Mr. Backus started hearing rumors that the resort, like the economy, was having financial troubles. He figured business would slow down and, at worst, someone would step in to buy the resort.But a few weeks later, the resort abruptly closed. The next day, when Mr. Backus and his wife went to collect their skis from an office, they had to shovel a path through the empty parking lot on what should have been an epic powder day.\u201cIt was eerie,\u201d he said.For a while people were hoping that falling prices would attract new buyers and a quick turnaround, but instead the bottom continued to drop.When Louise Francesconi bought her home at Tamarack in 2009, just as things were getting rough, she was looking for a good deal on a ski home near relatives. Instead she got a full-time job.Ms. Francesconi, a longtime military contracting executive, became president of the homeowners\u2019 association in 2016 and spent the last year negotiating to have a group of homeowners buy the resort\u2019s assets \u2014 land and buildings, mostly \u2014 from creditors.So, technically speaking, does this mean she went to buy a house and ended up with the resort?\u201cIt sounds complicated, but it\u2019s accurate,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where in the World Can We Find Hope?", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat is a mopey, Trumpatized liberal to do? When I need solace, I head (in my mind, anyway) to two beacons of hope: Denmark and Canada. There, too, democracy needs fixing, and thoughtful people are trying to mend the alienation between policy makers and voters \u2014 to persuade the experts and the common people not to give up on one another. They have almost convinced me that they might succeed.It won\u2019t be easy. Even in Denmark, that progressive utopia, liberal confidence in democracy has frayed. The left-wing Social Democratic Party governed Denmark for much of the 20th century, but now it keeps losing elections. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost most on this question of immigration, foreigners,\u201d Kristian Weise, who heads Cevea, a center-left think tank in Copenhagen, told me. \u201cThe response in the party has been to move to the right, to match the rhetoric and policies of the xenophobic populist right.\u201dMr. Weise lamented the progressive elite\u2019s refusal to double down on liberal principles and plainly communicate those principles to voters. \u201cPeople growing up after 1989 within the Social Democratic movement became very nonideological, because suddenly there were no longer the big contradictions,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitics became both technocratic and also very spin-oriented.\u201dAfter the end of the Cold War, it was tempting to think that the big questions were settled; experts would work out the details of democracy and capitalism. Yet as governments placed more trust in a technocratic elite, popular faith in government eroded. Across the West, rates of voter turnout and party affiliation declined.Meanwhile in Denmark \u2014 as in so many places \u2014 the tide of global capitalism eroded familiar ways of life. Rural communities hollowed out, and immigrants with strange clothes and creeds moved in. \u201cThere are bigots out there, but we believe the majority attracted to the populist right is disenchanted,\u201d Mr. Weise said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel the establishment is listening to them: \u2018You can\u2019t keep order in my world.\u2019 \u201dUffe Elbaek, a member of the Danish Parliament, helped found a new party in 2013 called the Alternative. He told me that the Alternative seeks to \u201cchange the political culture\u201d by crowdsourcing its platform through \u201cpolitical laboratories\u201d that invite Danes to read policy papers and meet with experts. \u201cThis is not politics coming from above, or outside, but from the inside and bottom up,\u201d Mr. Elbaek said.The typical town hall meeting \u201chappens when something\u2019s gone wrong, or a decision has been made, and an elected official is trying to explain it,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is dressed up as an opportunity to have your say. We try to subdue tension and emotion by giving a rational, technocratic account of the decision. Then what we do \u2014 least helpfully \u2014 is ask people to do the very thing we know most people are petrified of, and that\u2019s stand in front of a room of strangers and speak at an open mike.\u201d Naturally, \u201cit comes to seem that the essential quality of the public is volatile emotionality,\u201d he said: Schumpeter\u2019s \u201cprimitive\u201d voter.Instead, Mr. MacLeod\u2019s company sends out invitations to randomly selected households and then draws names to assemble a representative panel of volunteers. They meet with experts and policy makers for several weekends to study an open policy question. Eventually the panels issue nuanced recommendations on matters ranging from hospital budgets to mass transit.\u201cIf we start from the premise that people are more curious than we give them credit for, and that they are kind \u2014 if we design for their better angels \u2014 then lo and behold, the phantom public that seems to haunt public discourse disappears,\u201d he said.Deliberative democracy is no panacea. It can only supplement the electoral process, and cannot compensate for more systemic American problems like gerrymandering and the erosion of campaign finance regulation. Moreover, it can devolve into glorified market research that treats participants as focus groups, not engaged citizens. The result is outsize influence for well-funded interest groups and public relations consultants.The most dangerous threat posed by President Trump and his European allies does not lie in any single executive order or diplomatic crisis, but in their barren and cynical view of community. Sometimes I still worry that they are right: Maybe our prejudices and tribes are our most essential features, never to change. We have no choice but to hope that they are wrong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saved From Holocaust: \u2018He Loved Me and He Wanted to Keep Me\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Valentine\u2019s Day, couples often reminisce about that moment they knew they would stay together, whether during a vacation, over a fancy dinner or, perhaps, while meeting their future in-laws.For Isaac and Rosa Blum, who became teenage sweethearts 75 years ago in a ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland, that moment came as they and thousands of other terrified Jews were being herded to a death camp by Nazi soldiers.\u201cI saw her walking in front of me,\u201d Mr. Blum recalled. \u201cI went up to the German and told him, \u2018That\u2019s my sister,\u2019 even though she was my girlfriend.\u201dMiraculously, they were both pulled off the line and managed to survive the Holocaust by working as slave laborers in a munitions factory. The following 70 years have been a cinch by comparison, the couple said on Monday in their two-story house in the Manhattan Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn.He is 94, and she is a year younger. Asked to recount their lengthy love affair, they noted the absurdity of couching it \u2014 a romance incubated in the hell of the Holocaust \u2014 in the frilly trappings of Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201cYou have a mixed story here \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to put them together,\u201d Mr. Blum said, even while acknowledging that, yes, it was young, bold love that prodded him to stand up to a Nazi guard and save his sweetheart from being sent to the Treblinka death camp.A hasty marriage followed, and then a horrific honeymoon of sorts: stealing glances and brief exchanges under the stern watch of armed guards.By 1941, the Nazis had taken over the Polish city of Czestochowa and established a ghetto of about 45,000 Jews. It was in this grim setting that the two met, flirted, gathered with friends, played records and danced together.By autumn 1942, the Nazis were rounding up Jews for extermination. Mr. Blum was pulled from the line to work in the factory, while his family was pushed onward toward the trains bound for Treblinka. He would never see his family again.In that chaotic, horrific moment, he spied Rosa, brazenly approached a Nazi officer and tried to save the teenage girl up ahead walking with her family. A Nazi soldier grabbed her and asked if she was Isaac\u2019s sister, as he had claimed. She said yes.\u201cI was young and strong and able to work,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Come with me,\u2019 and I was pulled out of the line.\u201dThe memories are still vivid and bitter today, but the silver lining is that they still have each other to grow old with, living largely independently and doting on each other.He calls her a Polish term of affection that translates to \u201cold one.\u201d She calls him simply Blum, and makes his favorite soups every day.Mr. Blum is a no-nonsense type who considers holding hands silly and, truth be told, has little use for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201cHe\u2019s not very romantic,\u201d Mrs. Blum said, but his thoughtfulness reveals itself in little gifts and almost begrudging acts of tenderness.\u201cWe have a different point of view, but somehow we\u2019ve survived,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat keeps us together are the quarrels. That\u2019s the cement of a marriage.\u201d\u201cI love him in spite of all his defects,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy, but I wouldn\u2019t change him for somebody else.\u201dThey are both sharp and physically and socially active, even if they are no longer the strapping youngsters who were selected for labor by the Nazis.With their families sent to their deaths, they were placed in a smaller ghetto of about 5,000 Jews and, the lie about being siblings never detected, they were issued a marriage license so they could live briefly in a residence for couples before being separated in different barracks at the factory site, which was patrolled by armed guards.They toiled long hours, she as a welder and he as an electrician, which gave him the chance to approach her workstation to share covert glances. They treasured their few minutes of contact during \u201cso-called lunch,\u201d Mrs. Blum recalled.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know if we were going to live, so we wanted to be together,\u201d he said.When word filtered out that most Jews were being killed at death camps, they were incredulous, and counted themselves lucky despite their misery.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know you could build factories to kill people,\u201d Mr. Blum said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201dAs Mrs. Blum fixed lunch for her husband on Monday, she said she still had nightmares about the horrors, which included being strip-searched with a group of women while German soldiers watched and laughed. And she was in a medical ward after being pushed down some stairs by a Nazi. She shared the ward with a young Jewish woman who tried to hide her pregnancy from the Nazis. Jewish nurses drowned the newborn in a bucket, fearing that the baby\u2019s cries would doom them all.After being liberated by the Allies near the end of the war in 1945, the couple stayed in a displaced persons camp and were married a second time, by a city official in Austria with borrowed rings.Soon after, they managed to buy their own rings with a silver coin they had hidden for months. The two rings wore down over the years, and the Blums never replaced them.They moved to Argentina and were married a third time, in a more proper service. They had two children and then moved in 1963 to New York City, where Mr. Blum opened a furrier business, with Mrs. Blum doing much of the handiwork.They stay busy through programs for Holocaust survivors offered by Selfhelp Community Services, which is partly financed by UJA-Federation of New York and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.Reflecting on why he risked his life by approaching the Nazi soldier that day in 1942, Mr. Blum said simply, \u201cI wanted to be with her.\u201dThen, Mrs. Blum looked adoringly at her unromantic, 94-year-old savior and said, \u201cThey could have killed him right away on the spot, but he loved me and he wanted to keep me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Falling Home Prices Could Be a Good Thing", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySimplifying ShelterSuppose there were a way to pump up the economy, reduce inequality and put an end to destructive housing bubbles like the one that contributed to the Great Recession. The idea would be simple, but not easy, requiring a wholesale reframing of the United States economy and housing market.The solution: Americans, together and all at once, would have to stop thinking about their homes as an investment.Another big problem: High rent and home prices prevent Americans from moving to cities where jobs and wages are booming. That hampers economic growth, makes income inequality worse and keeps people from pursuing their dreams.In this thought experiment, housing prices would probably adjust. They would be somewhat cheaper in most places, where population is growing slowly. But they would be profoundly cheaper in places like super-expensive San Francisco.According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that\u2019s what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.We would still see homes of different sizes and styles \u2014 condos in some places, single-family homes in others \u2014 depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project\u2019s timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.That is a theoretical figure that includes easy-to-see things like increased sales of building materials and more jobs for construction workers. Most of the increase, however, would come from more abstract gains like increased wages for people who are willing to move from an economically distressed city to a faster-growing economy elsewhere, but are currently unable to because housing is too expensive.Over time, the accelerated pace of building could lead to a long-run deflation in home values. But for the most part that would be limited to a few coastal cities. And while the older homeowners there would most likely be resentful of all the new apartments, condos and townhomes that caused their home equity to shrivel, younger people would have an easier time getting started.Moreover, it\u2019s likely that lower home prices would encourage workers to move farther and more often in search of job opportunities. The impact on mobility could be huge, as the $1.5 trillion figure shows.Today, people with less education tend to go where housing is cheap, like Las Vegas, while college-educated workers with skills that are in demand still go to places where wages are high, like the Bay Area.Finally, if housing were plentiful and cheap, we would probably stop having big housing bubbles. One good way of describing a speculative bubble is a moment when society deludes itself into believing that something plentiful is scarce, or will soon be. In the mid-2000s, banks and homeowners came to believe that homes would be scarce in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, even though there were enough materials, land and labor to keep building and building and building.Housing is particularly prone to bubbles because, in contrast with other products, we seem to want it more when it is expensive and less when it is cheap. And no matter how many times we look out an airplane window to see vast acres of emptiness, we somehow still believe that land is a great investment because nobody is making more of it.Homes would still hold a lot of value; they still might appreciate, if more slowly; and desirable neighborhoods would still seem relatively expensive. But there would probably be fewer manias in which people expect home prices to double in just a few years.Just as we don\u2019t expect to make a profit selling our cars, if we stopped thinking of our homes as big moneymakers, we would probably start focusing on building them faster and less expensively.Homes would be stacked together, creating de facto apartment buildings that could be built and unbuilt in a few weeks. Although that wouldn\u2019t do much to help a family of four, it might take some pressure off the housing market by directing younger people to studios instead of having them pile in together, freeing up some three-bedroom apartments for families.For now, Americans seem unlikely to embrace this vision on a large scale, and even if they did, it would take a long time to start seeing home prices drop or flatline. But mass-produced homes from the past \u2014 brick townhouses or bungalows that came from a Sears catalog \u2014 are now sought after, so this imaginary world needn\u2019t be uglier, though it very well may be.Also, even if homes were a lot cheaper, we would probably retain the societal benefits of homeownership: As Mr. Glaeser and Mr. Gyourko\u2019s data shows, housing is already relatively affordable in the vast majority of American cities. So there is little reason to believe that people would desert overpriced neighborhoods if they suddenly became cheaper.This does not mean that select places like New York\u2019s West Village or San Francisco\u2019s Mission District would suddenly be affordable \u2014 or that American cities would suddenly fill up with towering condominiums and blocks of identical rowhouses. Housing is a regional problem, spread across miles of cities and suburbs, so a lot of new development would probably occur in close-in suburbs where there is more land than people think.Take Boston. The median Boston suburb has a minimum lot size of one acre, and many suburbs have minimum lot sizes of one home per two or four acres. That is a huge drag on the region\u2019s overall housing supply, according to Mr. Glaeser.Yes, adding more homes, even medium-density ones, would annoy people looking for less crowded quarters. But the nation as a whole would probably be better off, both in jobs and in financial security. The money not spent on housing could flow to other, possibly more productive, investments \u2014 like stocks in new companies or bonds for infrastructure projects.Of course, our view of homeownership is so entrenched in our economy, our political system and our tax code that it would be impossible to change in a short time, and probably even in a long time. But there could be political and societal benefits. What if local decisions that today are dictated by fears of declining property values could instead be made with an eye toward what\u2019s best for education or job growth?The point of this thought experiment isn\u2019t to embrace it full-on, but to open our eyes to the negatives of the national obsession of owning a home, expecting its value to rise, and using the levers of local government to keep neighborhoods as they are.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tom Price Is Confirmed as Health Secretary", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate early Friday approved the nomination of Representative Tom Price to be secretary of health and human services, putting him in charge of President Trump\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.By a vote of 52 to 47, the Senate confirmed Mr. Price, Republican of Georgia, after a debate that focused as much on his ethics and investments as on his views on health policy. Democrats denounced his desire to rein in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid by making fundamental changes to the programs, which insure more than 100 million Americans.Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said that Mr. Price, a 62-year-old orthopedic surgeon from the suburbs of Atlanta, was \u201cone of the most capable, well-prepared individuals that President Trump could have chosen.\u201d\u201cWho better than a doctor to head an organization that covers the wide variety of major health care programs?\u201d Mr. Enzi asked.The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said Mr. Price \u201cknows more about health care policy than just about anyone.\u201dNo senators crossed party lines on the roll-call vote, which ended after 2 a.m. on Friday.But he recently amended his financial disclosure statement to report a higher value for his investment in a small Australian biotechnology company, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Senate health committee, said his financial dealings raised serious questions about potential insider trading that ought to be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The Senate voted to confirm Tom Price as health and human services secretary.\u201cWhile Congressman Price served on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, he traded in health care stocks, pushed policies that helped his portfolio and got special access to a promising stock deal,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee.Mr. Price will be the first physician to lead the Department of Health and Human Services since Dr. Louis W. Sullivan stepped down at the end of the first Bush administration in January 1993.As secretary, Mr. Price will be responsible for a department with an annual budget of more than $1 trillion. Agencies within the department regulate food and drugs, sponsor much of the nation\u2019s biomedical research and combat public health threats, including the Zika virus, opioid drug abuse and bioterrorism.Some of the Democrats\u2019 animus against Mr. Price stems from experience. Working with him over the last 12 years, they say, they have found him to be an effective advocate for conservative policies that they abhor.\u201cBuying and selling health care stocks as a member of Congress while you\u2019re voting and helping those companies, that\u2019s bad enough,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cBut what he wants to do to maybe the greatest program in American history, Medicare, is much, much worse.\u201d\u201cYou could say his chief qualification for the job of replacing Obamacare is he had the good sense to oppose it in the first place,\u201d said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas.Democrats see it differently. \u201cThis is the first vote in the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, said Mr. Price had been \u201ca rabid supporter of defunding Planned Parenthood\u201d and \u201cseems to have no higher priority than to terminate health coverage for millions of people.\u201dAs chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Price supported proposals to shift Medicare away from its open-ended commitment to pay for medical services and toward a fixed government contribution for each beneficiary, which could be used for either private insurance or traditional Medicare. Such proposals could increase costs for some people.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said Mr. Price had \u201cdedicated his life to destroying Medicare as we know it.\u201dHowever, Mr. Trump, as a presidential candidate, often said he did not intend to cut Medicare.Mr. Price has endorsed the idea of giving each state a fixed amount of federal money in the form of a block grant to provide health care to low-income people on Medicaid. That would be a radical change. Since its creation in 1965, Medicaid has been an open-ended entitlement. If more people become eligible, states receive more federal money.Democrats have expressed outrage at many of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks but have not mustered the votes to stop them.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, said Democrats had smeared Mr. Price with \u201ca vague patchwork of allegations of ethical impropriety.\u201d He discerned a pattern: Democrats, he said, \u201chave appeared to be apoplectic about almost every single nominee we\u2019ve had before us.\u201dSenate confirmation is expected early next week for Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs executive who was national finance chairman for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.But Mr. Mnuchin, like Mr. Price, has been criticized by Democrats, who boycotted a Finance Committee vote on his nomination. Mr. Mnuchin initially failed to disclose nearly $100 million of his assets to the committee, and he faced scrutiny over the foreclosure practices of the OneWest bank when he was its chairman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suit Challenges Denial of Education Loans to Unauthorized Immigrants", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudent loan debt is not something most people covet, but for Mitzie Perez, a 25-year-old university student in California, borrowing money to cover her tuition bills would be a boon.But Ms. Perez, a junior majoring in gender and sexuality studies at the University of California, Riverside, has never been able to do something that most college students take for granted: obtain a loan to finance her studies. She sued a lender, Wells Fargo, that turned her down, claiming that its policy of denying applicants because of their immigration status is illegal.\u201cOur position is that banks are supposed to make these kinds of loan decisions based on an assessment of risk,\u201d said Ossai Miazad, a lawyer who is representing Ms. Perez. \u201cTo put that aside completely and deny people based on their immigration status is discriminatory.\u201dNo laws prohibit lenders from making loans to undocumented borrowers who possess identifying information like a Social Security number, which Ms. Perez has. Still, this is an area where banks tread very lightly.Among five of the nation\u2019s largest issuers of private student loans, two \u2014 Discover Bank and Sallie Mae \u2014 said they made loans to undocumented students under some circumstances.Discover \u201cdoes not differentiate between borrowers based on DACA status, and would loan to such individuals if they were otherwise qualified,\u201d said Robert Weiss, a company spokesman.Sallie Mae will make loans to qualifying students enrolled in DACA if they have a co-signer who is a United States citizen or permanent resident, said Rick Castellano, a company spokesman.At other banks, even high-interest student loans cannot be obtained by undocumented borrowers. Wells Fargo and PNC Bank said they required student borrowers to have United States citizenship or permanent resident status. Citizens Bank did not provide details on its policy.\u201cWells Fargo understands the dream of pursuing higher education, and we remain focused on our responsible lending practices to assist temporary and permanent residents and United States citizens in obtaining student financing,\u201d Jason A. Vasquez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said in response to Ms. Perez\u2019s lawsuit.Lenders face unique challenges in extending credit to borrowers who are not in the country legally. Students with DACA status can legally work in the United States, but that right could vanish if the program is curtailed or eliminated.Still, many banks, including Wells Fargo, will issue credit cards to undocumented borrowers. Ms. Perez has several credit cards (from banks other than Wells Fargo), and uses them to help pay her tuition \u2014 at a much higher interest rate than a student loan would carry.Ms. Perez said she was deeply anxious about the future of the DACA program and how Mr. Trump\u2019s actions would affect her and her family. But she also has immediate concerns, like how to pay for her next few months of schooling.For the moment, she works as a community organizer and uses her income and credit card loans to finance her education.\u201cI\u2019m considering having to drop out or cut back, because I can\u2019t make ends meet,\u201d Ms. Perez said.Thomas A. Saenz, the president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which helped Ms. Perez bring her lawsuit, said expanding access to student loans was a critical issue for thousands of people.\u201cWe are hoping that businesses will understand that this type of discrimination is not permissible \u2014 regardless of how folks may erroneously conclude that the rhetoric of the new administration may change things,\u201d Mr. Saenz said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change what anti-discrimination laws provide.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Lawmakers Like What They See in Trump. They Just Have to Squint.", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican congressional aides have set their iPhones to flutter every time President Trump hurls a thunderbolt on Twitter. Senators nod politely at his false claims of mass voter fraud during private White House meetings. The congressional morning briefing literature now includes a rundown of overnight and early-morning social media missives from the commander in chief.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take that long to read \u2019em,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee.After three weeks in the White House, Mr. Trump has made clear that he is going to continue promulgating conspiracy theories, flinging personal insults and saying things that are plainly untrue. And the Republican-controlled House and Senate seem to have made a collective decision: They will accommodate \u2014 not confront \u2014 his conduct as long as he signs their long-stalled conservative proposals on taxes, regulations and health care into law.\u201cThere\u2019s a widely held view among our members that, yes, he\u2019s going to say things on a daily basis that we\u2019re not going to like,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Senate Republican, \u201cbut that the broad legislative agenda and goals that we have \u2014 if we can stay focused on those and try and get that stuff enacted \u2014 those would be big wins.\u201dSuch accommodation is coming at a price, attracting incredulous or angry constituents to town hall meetings, leaving members flat-footed when presented with the latest presidential provocation and testing the capacity of now perpetually clogged phone lines on Capitol Hill.Some of this would have happened under any Republican president \u2014 lawmakers were quick to note the ferocity of protests under President George W. Bush. But much of it is unique to Mr. Trump, whose rampaging presidency has spurred uncommon civic engagement even in deep-red districts.\u201cWhat is your line in the sand?\u201d a retired Utah teacher demanded last week of Representative Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who slogged through a jeer-heavy forum back home.But at least for now, that is a price Republicans seem willing to pay. In effect, congressional Republicans have sought to compartmentalize Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, adopting a cafeteria-style approach. They reach for the more appealing offerings, such as the Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, and avert their gaze from less appetizing or, to some, downright indefensible elements (America is not so different from Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia), which would have surely drawn relentless rebukes if uttered by President Barack Obama.Some lawmakers take comfort knowing that the president\u2019s behavior last year didn\u2019t hurt their campaigns, and they have used the electoral result as a justification unto itself, suggesting \u2014 as Mr. Trump has constantly \u2014 that his campaign success validates his approach.\u201cHe\u2019s a unique personality, to be sure,\u201d acknowledged Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip. \u201cBut he\u2019s gotten this far the way he is, and I think that probably leads him to think, well, it\u2019s working for him so far, so why change?\u201dAnd Republican lawmakers do not mind?\u201cAs long as we\u2019re able to get things done,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.Individual Republican senators have criticized the president in mostly isolated cases, none more vocally than Senator John McCain of Arizona, who blasted the president\u2019s comparison between Mr. Putin\u2019s extrajudicial killings and American conduct, and recently expressed concerns about a military raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of an American commando and multiple civilians.Often, the president has taken note \u2014 in brushback pitches that serve as warnings, if not to Mr. McCain, then to lawmakers who might emulate him.\u201cHe\u2019s been losing so long he doesn\u2019t know how to win anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote of Mr. McCain on Twitter on Thursday morning, calling to mind Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion during the campaign that Mr. McCain was not a war hero because he had been captured in combat.The New York Times would like to hear from President Trump\u2019s supporters: What do you think about his policies so far?Hours later, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, went to the Senate floor and lamented the attacks on Mr. McCain and other Republicans.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, then followed \u2014 and seemed far less bothered.\u201cI personally wish he would choose his words a little more carefully,\u201d Mr. Hatch said of the president. \u201cOn the other hand, I kind of find him refreshing, that he doesn\u2019t take any guff from anybody.\u201dPrivately, lawmakers and members of their staffs have pleaded with Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle for more discipline from the president and his White House.\u201cWe might talk to the vice president, but certainly not for public attribution,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said of Vice President Mike Pence, who joins Senate Republicans once a week at their regular luncheons in the Capitol.By and large, though, Republicans in Congress are treating Mr. Trump as an individual to be worked around in his own administration.\u201cI think we can get a lot done with the people around him,\u201d Mr. McCain said, dismissing policy pronouncements from Mr. Trump that often differ from \u201cthe day before.\u201dPractically patting Mr. Trump on the head, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said, \u201cIf he pays attention to people like General Kelly when he\u2019s doing a travel restriction and if he appoints people like Neil Gorsuch when he\u2019s making appointments, he\u2019ll be rewarded for that by all the praise, and maybe he\u2019ll do more of it.\u201d (Former Gen. John F. Kelly is the Homeland Security secretary.)In hopes of repairing their relationship with Congress after the botched rollout of the travel ban, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have aggressively courted congressional Republicans. In addition to Mr. Pence with his weekly visits, Marc Short, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief legislative liaison, has already become ubiquitous in the Capitol.And powerful senators are enjoying significant attention: Mr. McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman, said he had already had three conversations with Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, and a breakfast with Jim Mattis, the defense secretary. Mr. Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee, had a 90-minute meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House. And Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the health and education panel, was invited to the White House last Thursday for lunch with Mr. Trump.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said there was \u201ca high level of satisfaction\u201d with the new White House, insisting that members cared little about \u201cthe daily tweets.\u201dThe deflection is bicameral. When a reporter recently noted that the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, had often declined to weigh in on the \u201ctweet of the day,\u201d Mr. Ryan lit up.\u201cYou got my talking points down already!\u201d he said, before gently fielding a question about Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the federal judge who halted his travel ban.\u201cLook, he\u2019s not the first president to get frustrated with a ruling from a court,\u201d Mr. Ryan said with a shrug.While the d\u00e9tente between an anti-establishment president and its establishment-aligned leaders on Capitol Hill may seem wholly transactional, some Republicans say the fury on the left toward Mr. Trump along with the denunciations from many news outlets has helped forge his bond with the voters that he and congressional Republicans share, particularly in the conservative-dominated House.When the president addressed congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia last month, Mr. Trump\u2019s aside about news coverage \u2014 \u201cnothing fair about the media,\u201d he said with a sneer \u2014 earned perhaps the most enthusiastic applause.\u201cWhile it may upset The New York Times, Hollywood, the cast of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 and the groups marching in the streets, it is not upsetting to the constituents that elected these members and senators,\u201d Sam Geduldig, a Republican lobbyist, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior. \u201cThere is a feeling that if those groups are against you, you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201dMore skeptical Republicans believe that lawmakers are deluding themselves if they treat Mr. Trump as a normal president \u2014 quirky but tolerable, like a colorful uncle at Thanksgiving dinner.\u201cThey\u2019re mostly ignoring him, humoring him occasionally while the rest of the family gets along fine, enjoys the turkey and watches the game,\u201d said William Kristol, the former editor of The Weekly Standard. \u201cBut he\u2019s not just a bit player or a guest. He\u2019s the president.\u201dAnd in the Capitol, he can never be ignored for long.Strolling to a meeting last week, Mr. Corker was asked about the latest Trump controversy: The president had just attacked the retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka\u2019s accessories and clothing line.The senator flashed a broad smile.\u201cDid he really?\u201d he asked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: On Catalina, the Drought Is Far From Over", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.For many Californians, the drought now feels long gone.But not everyone is rejoicing.On Catalina Island, just off the Southern California coast, water scarcity is so severe that residents still rely almost entirely on a pair of desalination plants.Catalina is home to population of 4,000 or so people and a beach playground for roughly a million annual visitors. Residents and businesses have had to contend with mandatory water rationing since 2013.Surrounded by ocean, the island has a major disadvantage to the rest of California: It can\u2019t tap the melting Sierra Nevada snow that sustains mainland farms and cities during the warm months.That\u2019s why officials have tightly restricted the use of Catalina\u2019s main water source: an aquifer connected to the interior Middle Ranch Reservoir. The drumbeat of winter storms has helped to replenish the reservoir, but as of last week it was still only roughly a quarter full \u2014 and summer is looming.He shared some of his pictures with us:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The proposal significantly raises the bar set in 2015 when Gov.

{"Headline": "Immigration Order Complicates U.S. Businesses\u2019 Plans in the Middle East", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs tensions rise with nations covered by President Trump\u2019s immigration order, American companies are watching anxiously to gauge the order\u2019s potential impact on business prospects, particularly in Iraq and Iran.Top American energy, military and industrial companies have helped rebuild parts of Iraq since the war there began in 2003, and Iraqi leaders are irritated that their country, which is working closely with the United States to battle the Islamic State, was one of seven predominantly Muslim nations included in the 90-day immigration ban imposed by the order.Some lawmakers in Iraq have advocated a reciprocal ban on United States citizens holding Iraqi visas, including contractors. But senior Iraqi officials have so far opposed such a move on the grounds that it would probably hurt vital oil exploration and production efforts.Nevertheless, some oil executives are concerned that the travel restrictions could incite hostility toward Americans working in Iraq or prompt other countries to retaliate with their own visa restrictions.\u201cIt\u2019s tit for tat,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, a Houston-based service company that operates across the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. Vuckovic said he had been scheduled to travel to Iraq soon to speak to officials in the country\u2019s energy ministry but had changed his plans.\u201cI have a visa but they may not let me into the country in retaliation to Trump\u2019s travel ban,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going over there for nothing. It\u2019s a very bad situation.\u201dFor American companies exploring business with Iran, the immigration order is just one new complication.The deal was made possible when President Barack Obama lifted an earlier round of sanctions after Iran agreed to an accord that curtailed its nuclear activities. Mr. Trump has criticized the nuclear agreement as weak, and he wrote on Twitter on Friday that Iran was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d with the missile test. Iran\u2019s leaders \u201cdon\u2019t appreciate how \u2018kind\u2019 President Obama was to them,\u201d he added. \u201cNot me!\u201dG.E., which would supply some of the aircraft engines under the Boeing deal, and AT&T are among other big companies seeking stronger business ties in Iran.G.E.\u2019s oil and gas and power generation divisions are active in Iran, and the company also has substantial deals in Iraq, as do most of America\u2019s largest military contractors.Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research group financed by Boeing and other military contractors, said that given how closely Iraq was working with the Pentagon, it was hard to believe that the strain caused by Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban would threaten any contracts to provide Iraq with military equipment.The tensions with Iran, he said, could actually prompt even bigger American arms sales to countries like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain that also are worried about Iran.The Trump administration has said the order is meant to keep terrorists from slipping into the United States, but it set off widespread protests over concerns that it was blocking legitimate refugees and travelers.Besides Iran and Iraq, the countries named in the ban are Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The biggest business and strategic partners of the United States in the region, like Egypt, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, are not affected by the order, though they have had problems combating terrorism within their borders.The United States lists Iran, Sudan and Syria as countries where the government supports terrorism and has banned arms sales to them, and American oil companies have suspended activities in those countries in recent years.Exxon Mobil has operations in Iraq and Yemen, among the countries covered by the immigration order; ConocoPhillips, Hess and Marathon are in Libya; and Chevron has operations in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.Most active across the region are service companies, like Halliburton and Weatherford, which offer technical services and training.Halliburton has an office in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, while Weatherford has three offices in Iraq and is active in Libya and Yemen. Weatherford announced on Thursday, however, that it would sell its Middle East rig-drilling division as part of a broader effort to shrink its business operations and stabilize its finances.Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a manufacturer based in West Chester, Pa., that has supplied rigs to companies working in more than 100 countries including Iraq, said that tensions over the immigration order could affect American business beyond the seven countries.\u201cMy concern is retaliation, and that is just going to open things up for competitors like the Chinese,\u201d he said, noting that Schramm workers move in and out of Iraq, as well as neighboring countries, and that their freedom to travel could be obstructed.\u201cWhat I am scared of is there could be a backlash in other Muslim countries or in general against America,\u201d Mr. Dynan added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always opened our borders and been the leader in trade and exports. It\u2019s our brand.\u201dSchramm has delivered rigs in recent years to Oman and Kuwait, and has shown interest in doing business in Iran.In December 2015, only weeks before the nuclear sanctions against Iran were lifted, Schramm was represented at a seminar on investing in the country at a conference in London sponsored by London Business Conferences, a producer of such events. Schramm was hardly the only American company there.Also on hand were representatives of the engineering and construction giants Bechtel and Jacobs and the power generation and engine company Cummins. In the end, Schramm decided to wait and follow bigger companies into Iran.Since the lifting of the nuclear sanctions, many major European and Asian oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell and Schlumberger, have entered into agreements with the Iranians to develop or service their oil fields. Many have been approved to take part in auctions to drill in some of the country\u2019s richest oil and natural gas fields over the next few months.But American companies, even if they have an eye toward an eventual thaw in relations, have not made a move because of other sanctions that prohibit doing business with Iran without authorization from the Treasury, as Boeing received.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Says Bathrobe Anecdote Is All Wet", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst 100 Days Briefing\u25a0 The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, took aim on Monday afternoon at a New York Times story that described President Trump watching television in his bathrobe.\u25a0 Opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on certain countries mounted, but the president remained defiant and unbowed.\u25a0 Mr. Trump turned to Twitter early Monday and began challenging polls that showed his travel order was not popular.\u25a0 A bipartisan group of former National Security Council officials filed court documents opposing the ban.\u25a0 The Justice Department corrected the record on how many people had their visas canceled because of the ban.\u201cThat is literally the epitome of fake news,\u201d Mr. Spicer told reporters traveling with Mr. Trump. \u201cStart at the top. I don\u2019t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn\u2019t wear one.\u201dThe White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes.Within moments of Mr. Spicer\u2019s comment, reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe.Mr. Spicer added that the story was \u201cso riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology.\u201d He went on, \u201cLiterally, blatant factual errors, and it\u2019s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or so-called reporting.\u201dThe overall piece, which described Mr. Trump\u2019s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic shake-up of a Washington culture he has never inhabited, was \u201cnot an accurate portrayal of what\u2019s really happening,\u201d Mr. Spicer concluded.Mr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning.On Twitter, Mr. Trump called the reports \u201cfake news\u201d that sought to marginalize him.If you missed Mr. Trump talking to Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News during the Super Bowl, you will have another chance tonight.In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to characterize The Times\u2019s coverage, which was based on interviews with several of his White House\u2019s most senior officials and others aware of the administration\u2019s inner workings, as \u201cfiction\u201d based on fabricated sources.It\u2019s official: Silicon Valley really, really despises Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order.The brief, filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is blunt and direct. The ban, it says, \u201chinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations \u2014 and hire new employees \u2014 outside the United States.\u201dIt is a remarkable statement of unity from the country\u2019s technology companies, many of which rely heavily on foreign workers. And it is a shot across the bow for Mr. Trump, foreshadowing a rocky relationship with Silicon Valley leaders over the next four years.The companies were not the only ones joining in opposition. Susan E. Rice, former President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, was among the leaders of a petition signed by a group of former National Security Council officials.The Justice Department on Monday corrected the record on an attention-grabbing claim that one of its lawyers made in a Northern Virginia courtroom about the impact of President Trump\u2019s executive order on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.That number, however, came under question later on Friday, when a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs said that the real number was around 60,000 and that the larger figure had inaccurately included diplomatic visas that were not affected by the ban.\u201cIn response to a question from this court as to how many individuals have been affected by the executive order, government counsel presenting oral argument, based on information he had received, stated that 100,000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of the executive order,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Department of State has since provided undersigned counsel with a revised number, which is roughly 60,000 visas.\u201dAn outside, pro-Trump political group is adding veteran fund-raisers and Republican Party strategists, and is also employing one of the president\u2019s campaign ad makers to try to ensure Senate confirmation of his remaining cabinet nominees.It\u2019s part of a $4 million effort, with three other ads focused specifically on the nominations of Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Tom Price for secretary of health and human services.Some of those ads have been broadcast in states with critical races in the 2018 midterms. The other new advisers are Cara Mason, who worked as the finance director for the Trump Victory committee under Reince Priebus; Rob Collins, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director; Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff; and Rob Simms, a former National Republican Congressional Committee executive director.With Mr. Trump\u2019s administration still evolving, the 45Committee has moved to fill a void, supporting the White House as it finds itself besieged by critics.Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff known for his uncompromising stance on illegal immigration, is back in the news months after losing his bid for re-election.Now he is asking supporters to help him raise $1 million for his legal defense fund. Mr. Arpaio faced numerous lawsuits alleging abuse and faulty medical care in several jails, and taxpayers in Maricopa County, where he was sheriff, spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense.In his email, Mr. Arpaio attributed his re-election defeat to a host of enemies, including \u201cleftist financier George Soros,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department.Mr. Soros spent an estimated $2 million last year opposing Mr. Arpaio, and the Justice Department under Mr. Obama filed criminal contempt-of-court charges against the sheriff for refusing a judge\u2019s order to stop discriminating against Latinos.As the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s largest county, Mr. Arpaio gained a national reputation for immigration raids that targeted heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around the Phoenix area.Thousands of people were caught up in the raids, which were often carried out without any proof of criminal activity, and which critics called racial profiling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dismal Voucher Results Surprise Researchers as DeVos Era Begins", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySchool ChoiceThe confirmation of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education was a signal moment for the school choice movement. For the first time, the nation\u2019s highest education official is someone fully committed to making school vouchers and other market-oriented policies the centerpiece of education reform.But even as school choice is poised to go national, a wave of new research has emerged suggesting that private school vouchers may harm students who receive them. The results are startling \u2014 the worst in the history of the field, researchers say.The voucher idea sat dormant for years before taking root in a few places, most notably Milwaukee. Yet even as many of Mr. Friedman\u2019s other ideas became Republican Party orthodoxy, most national G.O.P. leaders committed themselves to a different theory of educational improvement: standards, testing and accountability. That movement reached an apex when the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 brought a new focus on tests and standards to nearly every public school nationwide. The law left voucher supporters with crumbs: a small demonstration project in Washington, D.C.But broad political support for No Child Left Behind proved short-lived. Teachers unions opposed the reforms from the left, while libertarians and states-rights conservatives denounced them from the right. When Republicans took control of more governor\u2019s mansions and state legislatures in the 2000s, they expanded vouchers to an unprecedented degree. Three of the largest programs sprang up in Indiana, Louisiana and Ohio, which collectively enroll more than a third of the 178,000 voucher students nationwide.Most of the new programs heeded Mr. Friedman\u2019s original call for the government to enforce \u201cminimum standards\u201d by requiring private schools that accept vouchers to administer standardized state tests. Researchers have used this data to compare voucher students with similar children who took the same tests in public school. Many of the results were released over the last 18 months, while Donald J. Trump was advocating school choice on the campaign trail.The first results came in late 2015. Researchers examined an Indiana voucher program that had quickly grown to serve tens of thousands of students under Mike Pence, then the state\u2019s governor. \u201cIn mathematics,\u201d they found, \u201cvoucher students who transfer to private schools experienced significant losses in achievement.\u201d They also saw no improvement in reading.They found large negative results in both reading and math. Public elementary school students who started at the 50th percentile in math and then used a voucher to transfer to a private school dropped to the 26th percentile in a single year. Results were somewhat better in the second year, but were still well below the starting point.This is very unusual. When people try to improve education, sometimes they succeed and sometimes they fail. The successes usually register as modest improvements, while the failures generally have no effect at all. It\u2019s rare to see efforts to improve test scores having the opposite result. Martin West, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, calls the negative effects in Louisiana \u201cas large as any I\u2019ve seen in the literature\u201d \u2014 not just compared with other voucher studies, but in the history of American education research.There\u2019s always the chance that a single study, no matter how well designed, is an outlier. Studies of older voucher programs in Milwaukee and elsewhere have generally produced mixed results, sometimes finding modest improvements in test scores, but only for some subjects and student groups. Until about a year ago, however, few if any studies had shown vouchers causing test scores to decline drastically.Three consecutive reports, each studying one of the largest new state voucher programs, found that vouchers hurt student learning. Researchers and advocates began a spirited debate about what, exactly, was going on.Others have argued that standardized test scores are the wrong measure of school success. It\u2019s true that voucher programs in Washington and some others elsewhere, which produced no improvements in test scores, increased the likelihood of students\u2019 advancement and graduation from high school. One study of a privately financed voucher program in New York found positive results for college attendance among African-Americans.The new evidence on vouchers does not seem to have deterred the Trump administration, which has proposed a new $20 billion voucher program. Secretary DeVos\u2019s enthusiasm for vouchers, which have been the primary focus of her philanthropic spending and advocacy, appears to be undiminished.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Says U.S. Wants to Resume Major Military Exercise With Egypt", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt is my goal to get that exercise back on track and try to re-establish that as another key part of our military relationship,\u201d Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the United States Central Command, told an Egyptian television interviewer.General Votel\u2019s comments were made shortly after he met with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and top Egyptian military and Defense Ministry officials. It also comes amid a general warming of relations between Mr. Sisi and President Trump, who has hailed the Egyptian president as a \u201cfantastic guy.\u201dBut growing concern over the threat of militants in Sinai, many of whom have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State, as well as Egypt\u2019s decision to buy weapons from Russia and France, led the Obama administration to reverse course.President Trump appears even less inclined to let Egypt\u2019s dismal human rights record interfere with the security relationship between the two countries. Egyptian ministers are preparing for a planned visit to the White house in the coming months.The first joint American and Egyptian exercise began in 1980 and was eventually expanded until it became a major biannual undertaking. The largest Bright Star exercise, as the maneuvers are known, included about 70,000 troops from 11 nations and was held in 1999.Even if a formal agreement on resuming the exercise is reached soon, it may take 18 months or longer for a new Bright Star to be held because funds need to be included in the Pentagon\u2019s future budget requests.Though the resumption of Bright Star would send a loud signal that America is preparing to resume its relationship at the pre-2013 level, Egypt\u2019s main goal is still the resumption of a military financing program that allows it to finance military purchases worth billions of dollars, by leveraging expected future inflows of American military aid.The program effectively allows Egypt to leverage the value of annual American aid, currently at $1.3 billion, to several times that amount. It was frozen by Mr. Obama in 2015.Any concession to Mr. Sisi by Mr. Trump could, however, be tempered by resistance from Congress. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both Republicans, have been sharply critical of Mr. Sisi\u2019s continuing crackdown on civil society, in particular a proposed law that would make it nearly impossible for many foreign aid organizations to work in Egypt.In December, Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham said in a joint statement that if the \u201cdraconian\u201d law was passed, they would seek to introduce new restrictions on American aid to Egypt.\u201cThe Egyptians need to understand that Donald Trump can\u2019t wave a wand and make all of their problems go away,\u201d said Gerald M. Feierstein, a retired American diplomat who recently met with Mr. Sisi as part of a delegation from the Middle East Institute, a policy-research center based in Washington.An article on Feb. 27 about the United States\u2019 desire to resume a major military exercise with Egypt that President Barack Obama had canceled in 2013 to protest the killings of hundreds of civilian protesters misstated the year that Mr. Obama suspended a military financing program with Egypt. It was 2015, not 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Metropolitan Museum\u2019s Director Resigns Under Pressure", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThomas P. Campbell resigned under pressure on Tuesday as the director and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, after months of growing concerns among staff members and some trustees about its financial health and his capacity to lead the largest museum in the country.Met officials said that Mr. Campbell would stay on until June, the end of the fiscal year, but that Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and chief operating officer, would be simultaneously serving as interim chief executive. Mr. Weiss will work with Mr. Campbell and the museum\u2019s leadership on a transition plan while the Met seeks a new director, one of the most powerful in the art world.\u201cWe are not looking to appoint a new director immediately,\u201d said Daniel Brodsky, the museum\u2019s chairman, in a letter to board and staff members, \u201cbut instead will take some time to consider the leadership needs of the museum in a thoughtful and deliberative way.\u201dThe sudden end to Mr. Campbell\u2019s tenure came in recent days after key board members \u2014 including Hamilton E. James, who leads the Met\u2019s finance committee \u2014 insisted it was time for him to go, according to people inside the Met who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal confidential conversations and personnel decisions.It was Mr. James, the president and chief operating officer of the Blackstone Group investment firm, who by many accounts first sounded the alarm about the Met\u2019s financial condition after joining the board in 2010. Mr. James declined on Tuesday to be interviewed.The full board was not informed of Mr. Campbell\u2019s resignation until Tuesday afternoon, having been summoned to a conference call only an hour before. According to one trustee who spoke on condition of anonymity \u2014 having been instructed by the board chairman not to speak to the news media \u2014 Mr. Brodsky started the call by introducing Mr. Campbell, who then read his full statement in what the trustee called a \u201ctrembling voice.\u201dMr. Brodsky said that he would take no questions, but would see everyone at the next full board meeting in two weeks.In response to Mr. Campbell\u2019s exit, Mr. de Montebello said in a telephone interview: \u201cI wish him well in his new endeavors. The Met is a great institution and I\u2019m sure it will thrive in the future under new leadership.\u201dMr. Campbell, in his letter to staff and trustees on Tuesday, wrote that he had decided to step down \u201cin order to pursue the next phase of my career.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of The Met\u2019s accomplishments during my tenure,\u201d he wrote.Just how an institution as august and professional as the Met found itself in a financial emergency during a strong economy became the subject of public consternation, and some of the blame fell on Mr. Campbell as its chief executive.In 2015 Mr. Weiss, formerly president of Haverford College, was hired, a move viewed by many inside the Met as a way to bring in an experienced administrator to compensate for Mr. Campbell\u2019s managerial inexperience.Don\u2019t be overwhelmed by over 6,000 years of history at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We\u2019re here to help.But the Met also has had critical and popular success under Mr. Campbell, seeing its attendance rise to about seven million visitors a year (including the Cloisters). And the Met Breuer, which opened in March, has drawn 557,000 visitors \u2014 more than projected \u2014 exceeding the Whitney\u2019s annual attendance in that building.Mr. Campbell will have to give up his Met apartment across from the museum at 993 Fifth Avenue. It is worth millions of dollars, part of his hefty compensation package, which was about $1.4 million in 2015, according to the most recently available tax forms.Others have wondered whether Mr. Weiss, 59, might succeed Mr. Campbell since he has proved proficient as a financial steward and steadying force and is liked by the staff. In addition to an M.B.A., Mr. Weiss has a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in Western medieval and Byzantine art.According to a senior executive in the art world with knowledge of the board\u2019s thinking on the succession plan, who refused to be identified because of the sensitive situation, the trustees intend to use the next few months to see if Mr. Weiss is up to the job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malloy Moves to Narrow Gap Between Rich and Poor in Connecticut Schools", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Connecticut, there is a vast gulf between the quality of education in the state\u2019s wealthy school districts and those where families are poor.On Wednesday, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, proposed sweeping changes to how the state finances education in an effort to narrow that gap, shifting money from most municipalities to focus on a few with high rates of poverty.The judge, Thomas Moukawsher, ordered the state to revamp the way it funds its schools and nearly every other major aspect of the school system, including graduation requirements and special education programs.The case is under appeal, putting Judge Moukawsher\u2019s orders on hold. Nonetheless, Mr. Malloy said on Wednesday that, broadly speaking, he agreed with the decision and that it would be better for the state to \u201cdesign and take our own medicine\u201d rather than leave it to the courts.\u201cA lot of it is about education,\u201d Mr. Malloy said of his budget proposal in an interview, \u201cand rectifying what Connecticut has done to itself over a long period of time, which is to not properly support pockets of poverty in urban environments and some small towns. So we\u2019re seizing the moment to rectify that situation.\u201dUnder the governor\u2019s proposed spending plan, a new school funding formula would take into account how many students a district actually has. In the past, if a school district\u2019s population shrank, its budget did not, nor would funding necessarily increase for a district that added students, Mr. Malloy\u2019s office said.The new formula would also change how the state measures student poverty, using eligibility for a state children\u2019s health insurance program instead of whether students qualify for free or reduced priced lunch. The governor\u2019s office said the new measure would capture a larger number of poor students.Mr. Malloy also proposed shifting one-third of the cost of teacher pensions from the state to local governments. That would relieve the state of about $400 million it now spends each year.Increases of around $10 million or more would go to 11 municipalities. Hartford would get the largest increase, more than $47 million, followed by Waterbury, which would receive a $43 million increase. Both cities have a substantial number of poor families.\u201cThe numbers they\u2019re talking about are staggering,\u201d she said. \u201cTo run a school system, you have to have teachers for the children, and you have to have support staff, and you have to feed the children, and you have to run buses. They are complex organizations, and you can\u2019t just go and say we\u2019re not going to do X, Y and Z. You can\u2019t just go cutting things up.\u201dIn his ruling last year, part of a long running case called Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding v. Rell, Judge Moukawsher found major failings in the state education system, but he did not find that the state was spending too little money on schools. And Mr. Malloy, citing a period of slow economic growth in Connecticut, did not propose to significantly raise the amount the state would spend on education.James J. Finley Jr., principal consultant to the Connecticut Coalition, said his group disagreed with that portion of the judge\u2019s ruling and with Mr. Malloy\u2019s proposal on school financing, which Mr. Finley said was \u201credistributing slices within the existing pie.\u201dThe governor, he said, \u201cis following a Robin Hood approach, taking from those he perceives of as rich and reallocating dollars from them to the poor.\u201dMr. Malloy said that comment was \u201cmissing the point.\u201d He said the focus of the Connecticut Coalition case was on students who live in poor areas, where local property taxes are insufficient to pay for an adequate education.\u201cWe are taking care of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t make a cloudy day sunny, but I can rectify that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His lawyer said he would appeal the decision, after which the case would be referred to another court for a final ruling.Mr. Sarkozy, who could face up to a year in prison and a fine of 3,750 euros, or about $4,000, is out of the running for presidential elections this spring after a poor showing in a November primary for the center and right candidates, and he no longer leads the center-right Republican Party.In Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s case, the prosecution asserts that he knowingly authorized his 2012 campaign to surpass the strict spending limits set by French law.At the time, the limit for presidential campaigns was about $18.6 million per candidate in the first round of the elections, and about $5 million on top of that in the second round for the two top vote-getters, who included Mr. Sarkozy.The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said on Tuesday that Mr. Sarkozy was suspected of spending at least $45 million, nearly twice the limit, and that he had ignored warnings from his campaign accountants.The case against Mr. Sarkozy is part of what is known as the Bygmalion affair, named for the public relations company suspected of issuing false invoices to Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s party in 2012 for events that were actually for his presidential campaign.The prosecution asserts that the goal of the fraud was to hide the overspending by Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s campaign from the electoral authorities.Thirteen other people \u2014 including former party officials, aides close to Mr. Sarkozy and former executives at Bygmalion \u2014 were also ordered to stand trial on charges of involvement in the fraud, the prosecutor\u2019s office said on Tuesday.Thierry Herzog, Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s lawyer, noted in a statement that the decision was signed by only one of the two judges investigating the case, a potential sign of uncertainty about the evidence.\u201cThe clear disagreement between the two magistrates in charge of the matter is such a rare event that it is worth underlining,\u201d he said, \u201cas it illustrates the inanity of the decision.\u201dThe revelations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has portrayed himself as a virtuous politician, who, unlike his opponents \u2014 Mr. Sarkozy primarily \u2014 was untainted by legal scandals.Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Talk of Terror Listing for Muslim Brotherhood Alarms Some Arab Allies", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 In Morocco, it would tip a delicate political balance. In Jordan, it could prevent American diplomats from meeting with opposition leaders. In Tunisia, it could make criminals of a political party seen as a model of democracy after the Arab Spring.Of all the initiatives of the Trump administration that have set the Arab world on edge, none has as much potential to disrupt the internal politics of American partners in the region as the proposal to criminalize the Muslim Brotherhood, the pre-eminent Islamist movement with millions of followers.For President Trump, the designation debate is an election promise made good. He has made no bones about taking an approach to the Middle East that is narrowly focused on counterterrorism, and that plays to domestic supporters who view all Islamist movements \u2014 or even all Muslims \u2014 as potentially hostile.In much of the Middle East, though, the rapid pace and embattled rollouts of Mr. Trump\u2019s early orders have induced anxiety. Now many are following the potential indictment of the Muslim Brotherhood as a harbinger of things to come.\u201cThe Obama administration moved us away from the \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 narrative,\u201d said Emad Shahin, a dissident Egyptian academic who lectures at Georgetown University. \u201cTrump is taking us deeper into it.\u201dNot all are unhappy about the move to list the Brotherhood.But in countries where Brotherhood-linked parties are prominent in Parliament or are in power, experts say a sweeping indictment could have serious implications for domestic politics, American diplomacy and the broader fight against Islamist extremism.\u201cYou would throw many babies out with the bath water,\u201d said Gerald M. Feierstein, a former United States ambassador to Yemen, now at the Middle East Institute in Washington.But the very fact that the ban is under consideration by Mr. Trump\u2019s aides is being taken as an ominous sign in a region where religion and politics are carefully, and often precariously, balanced.The proposed designation has also reaffirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent embrace of Mr. Sisi, who has weathered a barrage of international criticism for his country\u2019s dismal human rights record in recent years. Mr. Trump has hailed him as a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d with whom he shares \u201cgood chemistry.\u201dEgypt wants the United States to resume a military financing program, frozen by President Barack Obama in 2015, that helps it make billions of dollars in purchases of big-ticket weapons like F-16 warplanes and M1A1 Abrams tanks.More than anything, though, a handshake in the White House for Mr. Sisi would offer a stamp of legitimacy to a leader who had been kept at arm\u2019s length by Mr. Obama.To some, it suggests Mr. Trump is set to take an approach in the Middle East that will not just tolerate strongmen and monarchs but also actively seek to embrace them \u2014 a throwback that evokes American alignment with autocrats like the shah of Iran in decades past.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say you will stand by your friends,\u201d said Mr. Feierstein at the Middle East Institute. \u201cBut authoritarian regimes are always brittle, always fragile. We thought we would stand by the shah of Iran until the day he got on an airplane and left the country. Now what do we have to show for it? We have 40 years of not being able to have a relationship with Iran.\u201dBrotherhood officials insist that the Trump administration has gotten it wrong. In a letter smuggled from the high-security Egyptian prison where he is being held, the Brotherhood spokesman Gehad el-Haddad admitted that his party had made serious mistakes during its yearlong stint in power in Egypt from 2012 to 2013. Citing the \u201chard-learned lessons of the Arab Spring,\u201d he said the Brotherhood had failed to heed loud opposition from millions of Egyptians who disliked Mr. Morsi\u2019s actions.But, he insisted, the movement renounced bloodshed. \u201cOur flaws are many,\u201d he wrote. \u201cViolence is not one.\u201dIn other places, the reality can be harder to pin down. By nature secretive, the Brotherhood takes different forms around the world. In some places, its members have condoned or committed violent acts. Its Palestinian offshoot, Hamas, carries out suicide bombings; in Egypt, angry young supporters have been accused of attacking Mr. Sisi\u2019s security forces.But that does not make terrorists of the many millions of people who support the Brotherhood\u2019s political ideology across many countries.One route for the Trump administration could be to narrowly designate specific Brotherhood branches as terrorists, said Mokhtar Awad, an expert on the group. But it would be better still, he argued, to \u201cengage in a battle of ideas.\u201dThe debate could prove an early lesson for the administration in doing business in the Middle East, which has long resisted broad-brush prescriptions. Unpalatable as its ideas may be to Trump officials, the Brotherhood may become just one of many factors they will be forced to grapple with.\u201cWe engage with the Brotherhood knowing they are problematic actors, but they are also a reality,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna of the Century Foundation. \u201cAnd the alternative \u2014 ignoring or repressing them \u2014 leads to a very bad place.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year that President Barack Obama froze Egypt\u2019s military financing program. It was 2015, not 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump\u2019s 2-for-1 Rule on Regulations Is No Quick Fix", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewPresident Trump intends to pare back a vast array of government regulations in fields like environmental protection, food and drug safety, and consumer finance. On Jan. 30 he ordered that for every new regulation it imposes, the government must get rid of two old ones.It is an interesting idea but a misguided one. Even if government regulations are sometimes a burden, they are clearly critical to the functioning of a modern economy and society.Yet while Mr. Trump\u2019s approach is wrongheaded, there is logic to it. The concept has backing in some behavioral economics and business circles, and is certainly popular among many of his followers, who are quite hostile to what they see as massive over-regulation. The emotional part of the issue is important, reflecting a long-term societal schism between highly business-oriented people and those of other persuasions.I can personally attest to the emotional side of the argument, since I see it reflected in my own extended family, where the Trump supporters tend to have strong business connections and seem to take regulation as a personal affront, as if it stands as a barrier to their self-actualization and personal fulfillment. They tend to disparage regulators, while I view these officials as unsung heroes. This division appears to be a core issue in our society, and if not dealt with properly, it could lead to the destruction of our immensely valuable regulatory framework.Putting emotions aside for a moment, there is indeed a problem \u2014 one recognized by both major political parties for decades \u2014 involving the need for incentives to get the level and tone of regulation right. Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order builds on a deregulation movement that gained considerable momentum with Milton Friedman\u2019s book \u201cCapitalism and Freedom\u201d in 1962 and the beginnings of the Thatcher-Reagan revolution in the 1980s.Mr. Friedman underscored problems of asymmetry in regulation: People who especially benefit from a particular regulation will be inclined to lobby or bribe government officials for it. On the other hand, members of the general public, who might suffer from such regulations, will not be attentive to the many rules that affect them, each in a small way. And once regulations are imposed, government officials may have little interest in deleting those that are mistakes. In short, government regulators may not always be properly incentivized to make sure the accumulated body of rules is actually benefiting the public, not just specific interest groups.Mr. Trump\u2019s two-for one executive order might be considered an application of behavioral economics to deal with an intractable dilemma. Tying the culling of old regulations to the imposition of new ones can be seen as a strategy for forcing regulators to overcome their inability to see problems created by past regulations that remain in force. The order might motivate them to divert time and energy away from their presumed enthusiasm for creating new regulations, using it to clean up the errors their predecessors left behind.But translating this attentional device into good regulatory policy will be difficult if not impossible, because the issues intrinsic to regulation are so subtle.The United States has historically wavered in its views of regulation and we are in danger of taking a wild swing once again. In the 19th century, for example, they were minimal. The first major federal regulator, the Interstate Commerce Commission, was created in 1887 to control fares charged by railroads. It was the beginning of the Progressive movement, which favored increasing regulations to protect the interests of the general public, sometimes irking the wealthy elite.By the Roaring Twenties, during the presidency of Calvin Coolidge, Progressivism was in retreat and regulations were in disfavor. Mr. Coolidge generally opposed government intervention in the economy on libertarian grounds, and some of his policies have a certain resonance in the Trump era: After all, Coolidge cut taxes on high-income people; appointed a very wealthy man, Andrew Mellon, as Treasury secretary; and restricted immigration by region of origin.In some respects, Coolidge was nothing like President Trump. Coolidge was a bland speaker, for example, who upheld decorum and traditional, even puritanical, values as the nation enjoyed a burst of personal and sexual liberation and extravagance. But he professed a faith in American business similar to that of the current president\u2019s, a tendency to think that not only could business do no wrong, but also that businessmen were the only people who matter.There was a swing back to a much stronger regulatory regime in the 1930s, with far tighter controls over banks and securities firms, and we still benefit from many of those changes. After further zigzags, we are now facing what could be a dangerously anti-regulatory environment.But we must remember that government needs to step in where private markets cannot function fairly on their own. Regulation is in the public interest in dozens of areas. Of course, we need to listen to aggrieved parties who feel that they are hurt by over-regulation and, when they have a good case, we should do something about it. But we shouldn\u2019t make the mistake of abandoning trust in the good works of regulators.The real solution to the problems that are the focus of the two-for-one rule is to provide better rewards, making government regulation a more attractive and respected career. The world is far too complex to make it possible to count up regulations meaningfully and impose a two-for-one rule.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Off to a Slow Start on Trade Promises", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump keeps firing verbal broadsides at Mexico and China, but so far his new administration has not acted to keep specific campaign promises about trade policy.Mr. Trump did not declare China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on his first day in office, as he had vowed, nor has he after his first month. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Thursday that his department was conducting a standard biannual review of the currency practices of China and other trading partners.Mr. Trump also has not initiated the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, something he promised to \u201cimmediately pursue.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a huge gap between rhetoric and reality,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow and specialist on trade policy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Mr. Trump made trade one of his signature issues during the campaign, excoriating what he described as failed policies that have allowed foreign countries, notably China and Mexico, to profit at Americans\u2019 expense. And he has not changed his tune since he moved into the White House.\u201cTake a look at Nafta, one of the worst deals ever made by any country having to do with economic development,\u201d Mr. Trump told the cheering crowd on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s economic undevelopment, as far as our country is concerned.\u201dBut the absence of clear action on China and Mexico is striking, both because Mr. Trump\u2019s language remains so bellicose and because the administration has moved quickly to keep many of the other campaign promises that it made.Mr. Trump has nominated a conservative judge to the Supreme Court and announced a freeze on federal hiring. He has reversed some Obama-era regulations and sharply shifted the government\u2019s policies on immigration. The White House is pressing Congress to approve a new health care plan and overhaul the tax code.Trade policy has emerged as perhaps the most notable exception.Mr. Trump\u2019s views on trade diverge widely from the mainstream of the Republican Party, more so than on any other issue of economic policy. And some Republicans were quick to warn Mr. Trump against protectionist measures, fearing they could damage American economic growth.\u201cThe main point I wanted to convey is that regardless of what action the incoming president takes on trade, he and his advisers should consider the effects on agriculture,\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, declared last month after meeting with Robert E. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be chief trade negotiator. \u201cI expect the new administration to work hard to maintain existing markets for Iowa and other farm states\u2019 exports and open new markets as well.\u201dMr. Trump said during the presidential campaign that he would declare China a currency manipulator on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his administration. He reiterated that commitment in his \u201cContract with the American Voter,\u201d which said, \u201cI will direct the secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.\u201dAnd on Thursday, Mr. Trump reiterated his longstanding view of China in an interview with Reuters. \u201cI think they\u2019re the grand champions at manipulation of currency,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dBut Mr. Mnuchin had already made clear hours earlier that the administration did not intend for anything to happen, at least immediately.In a televised interview with CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin said that China\u2019s currency practices would be evaluated on the same schedule as those of other American trading partners. The Treasury publishes biannual reports on April 15 and October 15.\u201cWe have a process within Treasury where we go through and look at currency manipulation across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go through that process. We\u2019ll do that as we have in the past. We\u2019re not making any judgments until we continue that process.\u201dSpecialists in currency policy say that they see no evidence that China is suppressing the value of its currency to increase exports, as it did in previous decades.The White House and the Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment.If the United States determines that China is manipulating its currency, a step the Treasury last took in 1994, the government would seek to reach an agreement with China, but could eventually impose tariffs on Chinese imports.The administration is also moving slowly on its pledge to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The White House must notify Congress 90 days before it begins renegotiation of a trade agreement. The Trump administration not provided such notification.The Mexican government triggered its own 90-day clock at the beginning of February, but officials are happy to watch and wait.\u201cWe are not in a hurry to change anything,\u201d the Mexican economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, told reporters on Thursday, noting that his counterparts in the United States have yet to \u201cdefine their objectives.\u201dOne reason for the stuttering start may be the paucity of administration officials. Mr. Trump has said that Wilbur Ross, his nominee for commerce secretary, will lead the renegotiation of Nafta and play a major role on trade policy. But Mr. Ross is awaiting Senate confirmation. A vote is scheduled for Monday.The Senate Finance Committee has yet to schedule a hearing on the nomination of Mr. Lighthizer, a Washington lawyer, as chief trade negotiator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Russia Motives", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe mystery at the core of the Trump-Russia story is motive.But why?It\u2019s not a simple question. In their Russia-related inquiries, the F.B.I. and the Senate Intelligence Committee will need to focus first on what happened \u2014 whether Trump\u2019s team broke any laws and whether the president has lied about it. Yet the investigators, as well as the journalists doing such good work reporting this story, should also keep in mind the why of the matter. It will help explain the rest of the story.I count five possible explanations for Trump\u2019s Russophilia, and they\u2019re not mutually exclusive.Kerry saw Russia, the key ally of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s civil war, as necessary to ending Assad\u2019s slaughter. Many other Obama administration officials believed that seeking Putin\u2019s help was a fool\u2019s errand. But remember that Obama never came up with an effective approach to Syria. Any successor would be wise to see if Russia could help moderate the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.Of course, Syria can\u2019t explain all of Trump\u2019s Russia ties. There are too many, and they\u2019re too ominous. Together, they point to the next three explanations \u2014 the conspiracies.The third explanation is a political conspiracy, and it\u2019s at the center of the legal inquiries. The facts are certainly worrisome. Trump campaign advisers had close links to Putin\u2019s circle, and some of them spoke with Russian officials during the campaign. Meanwhile, Putin\u2019s government was directing pro-Trump cyberattacks. If there was coordination \u2014 and there has not been any evidence to date \u2014 it would indeed be a worse scandal than Watergate.The fourth explanation is the flimsiest: the idea, contained in a dossier compiled by private investigators, that Russia has compromising material on Trump. Unless real evidence emerges, I\u2019d encourage you to ignore this theory.He does not go as far pursuing these themes as hard-core Russian nationalists, much as Trump merely flirts with the alt-right. Either way, the themes are undeniable. As Michael McFaul, a former ambassador to Russia, says, \u201cThe inauguration speech sounded like things I\u2019ve heard from Russian nationalists many times.\u201dStephen Bannon, who has emerged as the White House\u2019s most influential adviser, clearly believes in ideological alliances, and Trump seems open to them. After winning the election, he met with Britain\u2019s leading nationalist, Nigel Farage, before Britain\u2019s prime minister.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bow and Cooper in \u2018Children of Divorce\u2019: Poor Little Silent Rich Kids", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVD\u201cThe past is a foreign country,\u201d the British novelist L. P. Hartley wrote. \u201cThey do things differently there.\u201d In silent movies, you might say they act differently. The look is all.\u201cChildren of Divorce,\u201d a 1927 movie newly refurbished in a dual-format edition by Flicker Alley, stars Clara Bow. Born in Brooklyn, Bow, then 21, Bow was Hollywood\u2019s prototypical flapper, the epitome of silent screen vivacity, known as the \u201cIt Girl\u201d for her evident sex appeal. Her male foil in the film, Gary Cooper, was by contrast something of a pomaded stiff, uncomfortably awaiting the introduction of the talking pictures that would usher in his mellow yet authoritative drawl.Bow, Cooper and Esther Ralston (who plays Bow\u2019s childhood friend, described as the richest girl in America) all impersonate poor little rich kids, the products of broken marriages, deprived of love by their self-absorbed, high-society parents. (Bow\u2019s mother is played by the future Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper.) Given the inappropriate romantic pairing that ensues, the movie is actually an inadvertent argument for divorce. But it\u2019s mainly a showcase for Bow, a study in wide eyes and tousled hair.The unexpected subtlety and pathos of Bow\u2019s final close-ups are both a tribute to her and to the skill of Josef von Sternberg, then a Paramount contract director, who filled in \u2014 uncredited \u2014 for Lloyd. Sternberg is justly known as a director of actresses, especially Marlene Dietrich, but three years later, he would coax a terrific performance out of Cooper, playing opposite Dietrich in her first Hollywood movie, \u201cMorocco.\u201dSternberg\u2019s seriousness can hardly be overstated. \u201cThe Salvation Hunters\u201d announces itself as dedicated to \u201cthe derelicts of the earth.\u201d But the movie\u2019s opening third, shot in and around the mud flats of San Pedro Bay, in Southern California, is nothing less than sensational, mapping the terrain with unexpected close-ups and inventive angles. The movie\u2019s human element is introduced as an abstract reflection; the most active character is the dredge popping in and out of frame as it mechanically scoops mud from the harbor.Observing the scene from a pier in the bay, the Girl and the Boy passively bond over and take charge of an abused youngster: the Child. In the movie\u2019s second segment, this de facto family relocates to the city, finding shelter in an underpopulated bordello apparently controlled by an underemployed pimp. The Girl and the Boy continue to moon around \u2014 their movement takes on the quality of a lugubrious dance \u2014 until, prompted by the example of the prostitute next door, not to mention the Child\u2019s hunger, the Girl decides to apply kohl to her eyes and put herself on the street.Ms. Hale \u201cfelt nothing during the making of the film, nor was this a requirement,\u201d Sternberg wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThe emotions infused into her image were caused by the movement of a dredge, reflections in water, chalk scribbles on walls, chewing gum, real estate signs, sea gulls, and a cracked mirror in which she penciled her eyebrows with the charred end of a match.\u201d Her performance was created by the context in which it was set \u2014 and it worked.In the movie\u2019s final third, the Girl, the Boy and the Child spend an afternoon in the country along with their depraved neighbors. The land is unspoiled, save for a commercial sign that reads, \u201cHere Your Dreams Come True.\u201d Amazingly they do.

{"Headline": "Is the Met Museum \u2018a Great Institution in Decline\u2019?", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bad news had been building for months at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Tension inside the Met, the country\u2019s largest art museum, is running so high that when curators and conservators recently wrote a letter protesting compensation cuts, the museum\u2019s leaders chose not to show it to trustees for fear of leaks and bad publicity. Those who wanted to see the document had to go to the office of the Met\u2019s general counsel and read it under observation.After enjoying boom years, one of the most pre-eminent cultural institutions in the world is now struggling with missteps and the perils of overreaching at a time of uncertain resources. While many museums face financial and competitive pressures, the Met\u2019s troubles are magnified, given its stature on the world stage.How can a behemoth like the Met, the thinking goes, possibly stumble? Some curators and trustees have zeroed in on Thomas P. Campbell, the Met\u2019s director and chief executive since 2008, as well as the board that has backed him. The anguish can be intense, given the love that all involved have for the Met.\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy to see a great institution in decline,\u201d said George R. Goldner, who in 2014 retired after 21 years as the chairman of the Met\u2019s drawings and prints department and has since served as a consultant to the museum. \u201cTo have inherited a museum as strong as the Met was 10 years ago \u2014 with a great curatorial staff \u2014 and to have it be what it is today is unimaginable.\u201dDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by over 6,000 years of history at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We\u2019re here to help.Several people inside the museum, most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of losing their positions, said the Met under Mr. Campbell had tried to do too much too fast: overhiring in the digital department; overspending on an additional building, the Met Breuer, and on rebranding; overdrawing from unrestricted endowment funds to cover costs; emphasizing Modern and contemporary art at the expense of core departments; and pursuing the new wing before the financing was in place.Instead, the Met should have been contracting, given falling revenue from its retail stores and admission fees and rising expenses.At the same time, some hope that by reckoning with its troubles, the Met is poised to turn a corner.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the same page,\u201d said Keith Christiansen, the chairman of the Met\u2019s European paintings department. \u201cOne benefit from all this: It\u2019s brought the departments together with the administration to sit down at a common table, and that\u2019s something. Now what do we do to move forward and make sure the mission of the museum is not compromised?\u201dEfforts to right the ship have been difficult and painful. In addition to staff cuts, curators were asked to curtail spending for shows and acquisitions. The Met stages nearly 60 exhibitions a year, far more than most museums, but now expects to reduce its exhibitions to about 40 a year.Instead of moving forward with the architect David Chipperfield on a wing intended to help attract art and money from contemporary collectors, the Met has been forced to prioritize the replacement of its aging skylights and roof above the European paintings galleries.In an interview, Mr. Campbell acknowledged that the museum had \u201cbeen through a trying year.\u201d\u201cMy colleagues have every right to feel upset,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, one has to step back and look at the success of the institution.\u201dIn addition, the museum\u2019s attendance has increased to about seven million visitors a year, including the Cloisters. The Breuer, which opened in March, has drawn 557,000 visitors, exceeding projections.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole Modern art collection in the Breuer we didn\u2019t have before,\u201d said Hamilton E. James, a Met trustee. \u201cAttendance is at all-time records; critical acclaim has never been as good. An awful lot of wonderful things have gone on.\u201dMoreover, Met officials say, many cultural institutions have been grappling with a structural deficit \u2014 when costs exceed revenues, despite a strong economy. The Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum, for example, also recently offered buyouts \u2014 though they did not then move to layoffs. The New York Philharmonic has delayed the tentative date for opening its $600 million rebuilt hall to get a better sense of its cost. And the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is struggling to raise nearly half the $600 million needed for its expansion.While the Met charged Mr. Campbell with strengthening the museum\u2019s Modern and contemporary art activities, his focus on the Met Breuer and new wing has been controversial. Why try to compete with the new Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, some ask, instead of sticking to what the Met already does best?Mr. Campbell said he had aimed \u201cto sustain an environment in which scholarship could flourish and be the engine of our program, as well as to expand our audiences, to digitize the institution and to revisit what it is to be an encyclopedic museum.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve made remarkable progress, but these things are flexible, and they need modulation,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the same period, we have had to balance our expenditures and our income. In light of that, we\u2019re certainly doing some recalibration on the goals we\u2019ve set ourselves.\u201dSome critics say Mr. Campbell has been out of his depth \u2014 a tapestry curator thrust into the large shoes of the legendary Philippe de Montebello, with no experience running a major institution. (Mr. de Montebello did not have chief executive in his title until 22 years into his 31-year tenure as director.)Moreover, Mr. Campbell, by many accounts, has handled the economic crisis by hunkering down in a defensive crouch rather than reaching out to unite the staff \u2014 and the full board \u2014 behind his efforts. Internal critics say he failed to appreciate the upheaval caused by the turnover of three-quarters of the curatorial leadership through departures and retirements. They describe the pervasive sense that institutional memory is going out the door and the fear that the Met\u2019s mission to educate through scholarship has been overshadowed by its desire to attract millennials through social media.Mr. Campbell said internal relations was often a challenge at the Met, with its more than 2,200-member work force, and acknowledged that he could do better. \u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to open up communications \u2014 bringing people into briefings, in town hall meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve got it right yet, but we\u2019re heading in the right direction.\u201d\u201cI myself need to evolve my thinking and my interactions,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified those issues and taken steps to move forward in a very collective manner.\u201dThe Boston Consulting Group, hired a year ago pro bono to help with the Met\u2019s restructuring, was asked this month to interview staff members and trustees about their concerns because the museum recognized \u201cthat morale was challenged,\u201d said Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and chief operating officer. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that people feel empowered to say what they think.\u201dWhen Mr. Weiss, formerly the president of Haverford College, came to the Met last year, he set out to cut $31 million from a $332 million annual budget. He said Mr. Campbell had been open to making the changes required.\u201cWe have gone through a significant and difficult time,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cTom has been very supportive.\u201dDaniel Brodsky, the museum\u2019s chairman, said that Mr. Campbell and Mr. Weiss had taken appropriate steps toward financial stability and that he and his fellow trustees had not lost confidence in Mr. Campbell\u2019s capacity to lead.\u201cTom is a very bright person, and the board supports him,\u201d he said.Mr. James, the trustee, said many of the Met\u2019s struggles \u201cwere beyond the control\u201d of a chief executive. \u201cYou get bumps in the road, and you have to deal with them.\u201cThe leadership team of Tom and Dan \u2014 I view it very much as a partnership,\u201d he added. \u201cDan brings a discipline and a businesslike approach.\u201dStill, the Met\u2019s current retrenchment inevitably looks like a repudiation of much of Mr. Campbell\u2019s original agenda. He has been forced to let go many of his key hires, and his timetable for the new wing has been disrupted.But Mr. Campbell said he had not given up on his main goals to bolster contemporary art at the Met and broaden the audience in a technological age.\u201cI love the Met, I love the work I\u2019m doing here,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd I\u2019m very committed to seeing all of these many projects through.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Eyler Jr., the former chief executive of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and his wife, Gail Eyler, are suing Mr. Miller and his wife, Janice Miller, to keep the $670,000 deposit. A separate lawsuit filed by a limited liability company formed by the Millers demands that the Eylers return the deposit, arguing that they had every right to walk away.Although this dispute centers on boldface names haggling over an 87-acre property with a pond, swimming pool and a seven-figure price tag, the story is a familiar one: When a sale goes bad, tempers fly.In this case, a bank appraiser valued the property, 132 Seeley Road in Lagrangeville, N.Y., near Vassar College and Poughkeepsie, at $4.35 million, not $6.7 million. So, the Millers were unable to get the $3.35 million mortgage they had planned.Even under the best of circumstances, buying or selling a home can be a nail biter. Will the buyers get a mortgage? Will they survive a co-op board interview? What headaches might the home inspection reveal? Somehow, most deals work out.But sometimes, they don\u2019t. While many sales fall apart for legitimate reasons, as in the case of the co-op board rejecting the buyer\u2019s application, when one party walks away for reasons that seem dubious, the mood can escalate quickly from tense to vitriolic. Cue the lawyers.\u201cAny crummy apartment these days costs $800,000 or $900,000,\u201d said David A. Kaminsky, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. If a seller or buyer breaks a contract, \u201cYou would be ready to murder somebody,\u201d Mr. Kaminsky said. \u201cSuing somebody would be a mild reaction.\u201dContracts often include contingencies giving parties an exit, should something go awry. But when a contract is broken under disputed terms, the aggrieved party\u2019s options depend on the language of that deal. In New York, angry sellers often try to hold onto a buyer\u2019s deposit, as the Eylers did. But the buyer might sue for the money back, dragging out the process.In New Jersey, in rules that seem to favor buyers, a wronged seller cannot keep the deposit, but instead must sue for damages. As for buyers, scorned ones might sue for damages or for \u201cspecific performance,\u201d a legal remedy that could force sellers to close.\u201cAs a lawyer, I would sue for everything,\u201d said Steven R. Wagner, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.But rather than head to court, dueling sides usually end at the negotiating table, since buyers and sellers tend to want to close the deal rather than go to court.The house needs a new roof? The seller might shave $20,000 off the sales price to cover the cost. The apartment was appraised for less than the selling price? The seller might reduce the price since the buyer can only get a smaller loan, or the buyer might put up more cash since the loan amount would be smaller.The risk of a failed deal is often greater in the suburbs, largely because single family homes can have expensive problems that rattle buyers, like old chimneys, leaking roofs and wet basements.When a buyer applies for a mortgage, the bank sends an appraiser to determine the value of the property based on recent comparable sales in the area. Banks generally are willing to lend up to 80 percent of the appraised value. But if the property appraises for less than the sales price, the buyer will face a shortfall, as was the case with Mr. Miller. Mr. Eyler argues in his lawsuit that the appraiser was not familiar with the area, and that the appraisal report was \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\u201cIn the places where inventory is very tight, that puts pressure on the buyer to put an offer in on something they can\u2019t afford,\u201d said Felipe Chacon, the housing data analyst for Trulia, \u201cand pressure on the seller to be on the lookout for something better.\u201dLosing out on an apartment is not just a financial setback; it can be an emotional one. Last summer, Mariana Lo and her fianc\u00e9, David Burke, 30, were under contract to buy a one-bedroom co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens, for $375,000. Then the sellers\u2019 lawyer told them the deal was off because the sellers needed more time to renovate their new apartment. After that, Ms. Lo, 28, and Mr. Burke heard nothing.The couple, having relinquished a rent-stabilized apartment, stayed with friends and in short-term rentals, waiting for clarity. The whole time, the sellers still had their deposit. \u201cWe were in this weird limbo,\u201d said Ms. Lo, a litigation assistant at Earthjustice. \u201cIt was a constant state of anxiety.\u201dIn October, Ms. Lo and Mr. Burke received a letter canceling the contract, along with a check for their $37,500 deposit. The couple rented a one-bedroom in Hamilton Heights, Manhattan, paying a higher rent than before, and called a lawyer who filed a lawsuit to force the sellers to close.The lawsuit brought the sellers back to the negotiating table. Ms. Lo and Mr. Burke didn\u2019t get the apartment, but the sellers ultimately agreed to pay them $25,000 in damages. A lawyer for the sellers did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cWe were really angry,\u201d Ms. Lo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an object; it\u2019s your home. We had all these hopes and dreams pinned on this place, and it was just, bam, snatched away.\u201dThe 360 View column last Sunday, about a disputed contract for a house in Dutchess County, misstated the middle initial of the owner of the property. He is John H. Eyler Jr., not John. J.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protests Rock Romania After Government Weakens Corruption Law", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHuge protests, among the largest since the fall of communism, have rocked Romania after the government passed a law that would effectively allow official corruption.More than 250,000 Romanians took to the streets, about half of them in the capital, Bucharest. \u201cThieves, thieves,\u201d they shouted, denouncing the government and corruption. A few demonstrators clashed with riot police.The measure had been debated for several weeks, but the government decided to adopt it abruptly late on Tuesday night, stunning observers. Officials including Liviu Dragnea, the leader of the governing Social Democratic Party, stand to benefit from the measure. Mr. Dragnea faces charges of abuse of power involving a sum of 24,000 euros, or about $25,800.Romania\u2019s top judicial watchdog, the Superior Magistrates\u2019 Council, on Wednesday issued a constitutional court challenge to the decree. Another body, the Higher Judicial Council, which helps oversee the court system, has also challenged the law.President Klaus Iohannis, whose role as head of state is largely ceremonial but who commands respect in many parts of the country, asked the constitutional court to strike it down.Mr. Iohannis, who was elected in 2014 as the first president from the country\u2019s German-speaking minority, called Tuesday a \u201cday of mourning for the rule of law.\u201dIn the northwestern city of Cluj, Raluca Sandor, a 30-year-old pharmacist, braved cold weather to take part in the demonstrations.\u201cThis decree will drag Romania back in time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Social Democratic Party is the most corrupt party, and they are trying to save themselves from prosecution. I want the government to resign and these decrees to be canceled.\u201dAnother demonstrator in Cluj, Alexandrin Pop, 30, said, \u201cI\u2019m protesting because I see this as an assault on the judiciary and the rule of law.\u201dAlexandra Zaraf, 27, one of many young protesters in Bucharest, asked, \u201cWhat self-respecting government issues emergency ordinances at 9 p.m. and publishes it in the middle of the night?\u201d She added, \u201cIn a world where we talk about corruption, they want to change legislation and encourage it or go easy on punishing it.\u201dUntil recently, Romania, which joined the European Union in 2007, along with Bulgaria, was seen as making slow but steady progress on corruption. The new law threatens to create a new problem for the bloc\u2019s executives in Brussels, who are already troubled by problems like the Greek debt crisis, sluggish growth among the countries that use the euro currency and Britain\u2019s plans for withdrawing from the bloc.Analysts feared that the government could further reverse the country\u2019s progress and that an open conflict between the government and the president could create a lasting deadlock.\u201cI don\u2019t understand what the protesters are upset about,\u201d Mr. Dragnea said before the decree was passed on Tuesday.In fact, senior political and business figures, including Mr. Dragnea, were under investigation and likely to be convicted under the rules the decree was concerning.\u201cRomania is far from being a success story,\u201d Ms. Mungiu-Pippidi said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe ended impunity, we managed to put in jail very important people. But the problem is that corruption has not gone down \u2014 people who replaced those people behave similarly.\u201d\u201cThis is a disaster for the Social Democratic Party, which wanted to change its image of a corrupt party and show that there is a new generation prepared to rule,\u201d said Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj.Mr. Miscoiu described the ruling party as \u201ca rural conservative party with a left-wing component in social and economic policies\u201d that was more similar to the ruling conservatives in neighboring Hungary and Poland than their leftist counterparts. He said the Social Democrats could follow the playbook of the right-wing leaders in those countries, consolidating power and clashing with the European Union, and \u201cplaying a little bit on the populist, nationalist side, trying to show that Romania has the right to have its own policies, including in justice.\u201dGlen Johnson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Talks Tuition, Free for All", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEd TalkOne of President Trump\u2019s few statements about higher education finance reflected his desire to bring tuition prices down by cutting what he called administrative bloat and tapping endowments. Do you agree with that approach?We do have to do our best to make sure that colleges and universities are cost-effective and that endowments are not used to build 50,000- or 100,000-person football stadiums or for spending a fortune on four-star suites. Very often, however, many of the costs associated with colleges don\u2019t have a lot to do with education per se, whether it\u2019s health care for faculty or energy costs. And those are national problems that we have to address.So should they have to spend more of their endowments and should we restrict how they do spend them?I will certainly look at any legislation that comes up, and if it makes sense to me, I\u2019m happy to support it.But my focus right now is to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. I was pleased to see Governor Cuomo carrying the banner. I will be supporting any governor who wants to do this.Right now and for well over 100 years, we\u2019ve talked about public education in America as being K-12. So we have to change the definition of what free public education means in a changing economy. We used to be No. 1 in the world, in terms of the percentage of people who graduated from college and universities. Today, we are No. 11 among people 35 and under.Do you worry that a focus on covering the tuition costs for students at public schools implicitly encourages those universities to keep raising prices, in effect giving them cover to do so?I don\u2019t think so. What you\u2019ve seen in recent years is significant underfunding. But I think it\u2019s incumbent on those state legislatures and governors to make sure they are run cost-effectively and hire people who are capable of doing that.President Trump has suggested federal student loan forgiveness for all borrowers after 15 years of payment, instead of the 20 years that is standard in many instances now. Is that something you can get behind?It\u2019s a start, though I can\u2019t give you a definitive answer. What I proposed during the campaign was to immediately allow all people to refinance loans at the lowest interest rate they can find. That would be an incredible first step.So a family from Burlington, Vt., stops you on the street and asks how to figure out whether private colleges like Middlebury or Champlain are $40,000 a year better than the University of Vermont. What would you have them look at, and should the government demand that schools produce more data on actual value?We need to have as much information as we can about how a school performs, but \u201cvalue\u201d is a hard word to define. They can say, as they do at Champlain, that 88 percent of graduates are employed in jobs related to their goals, and that\u2019s important to know. On the other hand, I have a good friend who teaches poetry at the University of Vermont. There\u2019s probably not a great market for poets. But is that to say it\u2019s not important? You can\u2019t just look at things from a corporate perspective. Teaching poetry is important.This interview has been condensed and lightly edited.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Proposes New Rules to Steady Insurance Markets Under Health Law", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration proposed new rules on Wednesday to stabilize health insurance markets roiled by efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, by big increases in premiums and by the exodus of major insurers.The proposed rules, backed by insurance companies, would tighten certain enrollment procedures and cut the health law\u2019s open enrollment period in half, in hopes that a smaller but healthier consumer base will put the marketplaces on sounder financial footing and attract more insurance companies in states with limited choices.But part of the market\u2019s problem stems from President Trump\u2019s determination to repeal the health law while the White House and Congress struggle to find a politically acceptable replacement. Even as the Department of Health and Human Services worked to answer insurance company concerns, the Internal Revenue Service and Congress were taking steps that could add uncertainty to the jittery insurance economy.On Capitol Hill, conservatives declared that they are not about to accept a health law replacement that remotely resembles the Affordable Care Act. And the I.R.S. adopted a policy for the coming tax season that could weaken the requirement for people to have insurance. The tax agency said it was reversing one aspect of an Obama administration plan after Mr. Trump, on his first day in office, issued an executive order instructing agencies to reduce burdens imposed by compliance with the Affordable Care Act wherever legally possible.The proposed rules signal the Trump administration\u2019s urgency in trying to keep other insurers from fleeing the market after Humana\u2019s departure. The company said on Tuesday that it was losing money by insuring too many sick people without enough healthy ones enrolling. Humana had already scaled back its participation to 11 states this year, from 19 in 2016.Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, said Wednesday that the marketplaces were in \u201ca death spiral,\u201d and at a conference sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, he declined to say if his company would participate next year. And Molina Healthcare, one of the few insurers that seemed to be financially successful under the health law, reported on Wednesday that it was losing money in the marketplaces. It threatened to drop out if its concerns about a risk-sharing program requiring the company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to other insurers were not addressed.Dr. Patrick H. Conway, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the rules proposed on Wednesday \u201cwill help protect Americans enrolled in the individual and small group health insurance markets while future reforms are being debated.\u201dBut Democrats and consumer groups denounced the proposed rules, saying they would make it more difficult for people to enroll and increase costs for some consumers.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the rules sent \u201ca clear message to the American people: Patients are not a priority, and insurance companies are back in charge.\u201dUnder the proposed rules, the annual open enrollment period would be reduced to about six weeks from two months. The shorter time frame would be similar to the open enrollment periods for Medicare and for many employer-sponsored health plans.But the administration acknowledged that the shorter sign-up period \u201ccould lead to a reduction in enrollees, primarily younger and healthier enrollees\u201d who often sign up near the deadline.Other parts of the rules would limit opportunities for people to hold off on buying insurance until they get sick, a phenomenon that has loaded many health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act with more expensive, sick customers than they expected. By manipulating a system that now precludes insurers from rejecting customers with pre-existing medical conditions, consumers are avoiding the purchase of insurance when they are healthy and rushing in when they need it, insurers say.People can sign up after the deadline if they experience certain \u201clife changes\u201d like having a baby, getting married or losing employer-sponsored insurance. Insurers have told the government for several years that people who sign up in a special enrollment period use up to 50 percent more services than those who sign up in the regular enrollment season.Insurers and Republican members of Congress welcomed the proposed changes, which will be published in the Federal Register on Friday, giving the public until March 7 to comment. Final rules are likely to be issued in March or April. Insurers must decide by early May what kinds of health plans they will offer in 2018.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said the proposals were \u201cimportant first steps to rescue a collapsing Obamacare individual market.\u2019\u2019But insurers cautioned that the proposed rules, while helpful, would in no way provide a solution if, in a few weeks, Republicans introduce legislation to repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the requirement for most Americans to have coverage.Christopher W. Hansen, the president of the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society, said the tighter restrictions on special enrollment periods could \u201ccause problems for cancer patients,\u201d delaying treatment and reducing their chances of survival.Changes being made by the I.R.S. could weaken incentives for people to obtain insurance. The tax agency said it would accept and process tax returns even if taxpayers failed to indicate whether they had coverage, qualified for an exemption or were paying the penalty for going without insurance.The individual mandate, requiring most Americans to have insurance, was to be enforced through the tax system. The I.R.S. said the requirement was \u201cstill in force until changed by Congress.\u201d The government can deduct the amount of any penalty from refunds that would otherwise be sent to taxpayers. But it is unclear how it will use this authority.In the rules proposed Wednesday, the Trump administration said that it would generally allow states to determine whether insurance plans had enough doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to serve patients. The hope is that would lure more insurers into the market. Additionally, insurers could refuse to provide new coverage to consumers who failed to pay premiums owed in the previous year. If an insurer terminates coverage for nonpayment of premiums, it could require consumers to pay all past-due premiums owed to that insurer before restarting coverage.And insurers would be allowed to sell health plans covering a smaller share of expected costs. The administration said consumers would have \u201cmore coverage options\u201d as a result, but it acknowledged that some consumers could see increases in their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.Thomas Kaplan and Margot Sanger-Katz contributed reporting from Washington, and Reed Abelson from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nude Christ by Michelangelo, Long Forgotten, Will Be Shown in London", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBASSANO ROMANO, Italy \u2014 It might seem odd that a nearly seven-foot-tall statue of Christ by Michelangelo \u2014 and a nude one at that \u2014 would go unnoticed for centuries.But that\u2019s what happened to \u201cRisen Christ,\u201d a monumental figure that was transferred to a country church about 35 miles from Rome in the 17th century and that fell into oblivion until 1997, when scholars attributed it to the Renaissance master.\u201cIt was thought to be an imitation\u201d of a Michelangelo, and \u201cnot a faithful one at that,\u201d said the Rev. Cleto Tuderti, prior of the San Vincenzo Monastery on the outskirts of Bassano Romano, near Viterbo, where the statue was taken in 1644. \u201cCertainly, no one thought it was by Michelangelo.\u201dFather Tuderti says he is convinced that the unknown provenance of the work ensured its salvation through the ages.When Napoleon\u2019s troops invaded Italy at the end of the 18th century, they sacked Bassano Romano but did not touch the statue, he said. During World War II, the Germans \u201cset up a command post in Bassano,\u201d but they did not loot the statue, he continued. And when the Odescalchi family donated the badly dilapidated monastery to Father Tuderti\u2019s predecessor in 1941, they removed other artifacts, but not the statue, he said cheerfully.\u201cFortunately, no one knew it was an original,\u201d said Father Tuderti, who belongs to the Sylvestrine Benedictine order. \u201cThat\u2019s what saved it, and preserved it here, in situ.\u201dSince the statue was identified as a Michelangelo, however, the monastery has gladly shown off its treasure, allowing the statue to travel to exhibitions around the world, including in Rome, Berlin and Mexico City.\u201cRisen Christ\u201d was commissioned in 1514 by Metello Vari, the nephew of a wealthy Roman patrician, Marta Porcari, whose will required her heirs to build a chapel in her memory in the church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva in Rome. Documents show that Vari asked Michelangelo to sculpt a life-size figure of a standing, nude Christ holding a cross.But Michelangelo abandoned work on the statue after finding a deep, black vein cutting through the left cheek. He returned to Florence and fretted over the aborted commission. \u201cI\u2019m dying of anguish,\u201d he wrote to Leonardo Sellaio, a bank agent, in December 1518.Soon after, the artist began a second version of \u201cRisen Christ,\u201d which he completed in 1521. That work is still in the church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva.But Michelangelo also gave Vari the first, incomplete statue, which fell into obscurity after Vari\u2019s death in 1554. It was acquired in Rome roughly 50 years later by the Giustiniani family, wealthy collectors \u2014 and famously patrons of Caravaggio \u2014 who presumably did not know the statue\u2019s genesis.Another artist was commissioned to finish the statue, and in 1644, the Christ was transferred to the recently built church of San Vincenzo Martire in Bassano Romano, where it remained on the main altar until 1979.The prior at the time, the Rev. Ildebrando Gregori, chose to dedicate the main altar to devotion of the Holy Face of Jesus, and he moved the \u201cRisen Christ\u201d to the sacristy.The \u201cRisen Christ\u201d was known only from writings describing Michelangelo's work on a statue of that description until Dr. Irene Baldriga and Prof. Silvia Danesi Squarzina of La Sapienza University in Rome, who were working on the Giustiniani archives, tracked down the statue in 1997.After other documents emerged and the attribution to Michelangelo was confirmed, there was some discussion about where the statue should go and in what guise.Michelangelo had sculpted a nude Christ because, in 1514, \u201creverence for classical antiquity and the timeless beauty of the human body\u201d still held sway, Professor Squarzina said. Later, in keeping with the mores of the Counter-Reformation, a bronze cloth was added to cover the Christ\u2019s groin.\u201cThe monks didn\u2019t want a nude statue on the main altar, but we wanted to display it as Michelangelo had created it, so we arrived at a compromise,\u201d said Professor Squarzina, who had the backing of the state\u2019s art authorities. The bronze cloth was removed, and the statue was placed in a side chapel where it is protected by alarms and a heavy metal grate.Both versions of the statue will be exhibited at the National Gallery (the Minerva one in a plaster cast), so that they can be studied side-by-side for the first time.\u201cThe evolution between the two versions is fascinating and ties into Michelangelo\u2019s relationship with Sebastiano,\u201d the focus of the exhibition, said Matthias Wivel, the National Gallery\u2019s curator of 16th-century Italian paintings. The statues \u201chelp us tell this story,\u201d he said.Sebastiano, moreover, was involved in the haphazard installation of the second version of the statue in the Minerva, which he described in panicky letters to Michelangelo. Those letters will also be included in the London show.Father Tuderti says he hopes that the statue\u2019s notoriety will bring more visitors to the monastery, which runs a bed-and-breakfast. Few locals come to the site, he said, perhaps not knowing that there was a Michelangelo to behold.\u201cViterbo is closed mentally, like their Etruscan forbears, they\u2019re more appreciative of what\u2019s on the table\u201d and in their farms, Father Tuderti said. \u201cI hope they don\u2019t hear me,\u201d he joked.After London, the statue is set to travel to Japan for other exhibitions, he said.Some art experts fear that the statue \u2014 which weighs around a ton and has to be transported using military planes \u2014 has been traveling more than it should, putting it at risk of damage or loss.But Father Tuderti says that the attribution to Michelangelo has been a godsend, and that the money the monastery makes from lending it for exhibitions has paid off large tax debts and is helping to finance the construction of a monastery in the Republic of Congo.\u201cThe statue was identified at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in financial difficulty, and this statue now brings us a little help every once in a while.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted the name of one of the discoverers of the \u201cRisen Christ\u201d sculpture.

{"Headline": "Split by \u2018Brexit,\u2019 May and Merkel Diverge on Wider Issues, Too", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In another era they could have been allies.Both vicars\u2019 daughters and born just a few years apart, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain share an understated pragmatism and conservative roots, and have made their way in the still largely man\u2019s world of politics. But there could be so much more.Instead, because of Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union, they find themselves on opposite sides of the biggest divorce in recent European history, a chasm that has fundamentally reordered their priorities and is hindering them from cooperating on the broader issues.At a meeting of European leaders in Malta last week, Mrs. May and Ms. Merkel abruptly canceled a planned bilateral meeting after a brief exchange during a sightseeing excursion was deemed enough. After lunch, when it came to discussing the threats facing Europe, Mrs. May was shown the door.Their differing priorities were on ample display this past week as they dealt with both Mr. Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.Mrs. May, whose priority is to sign bilateral trade deals to offset her country\u2019s departure from Europe\u2019s single market, rushed to be the first foreign leader received by Mr. Trump after he took office.\u201cIt\u2019s chalk and cheese,\u201d said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European history at Oxford. \u201cBut none of this tells you very much about the contrasting character of the two women. It tells you about the contrasting positions of the two countries.\u201dIf Ms. Merkel can still afford to be an idealist, Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d has turned Mrs. May into a calculating realist.Within hours of leaving Mr. Trump, she was on a plane to Turkey. Upon arriving, Mrs. May waffled in her judgment of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, later stiffening her criticism after a public outcry. She also negotiated a deal with Turkey involving the British defense company BAE Systems.But only occasionally have there been glimpses of the partnership that might have been.In July, Ms. Merkel was almost effusive in welcoming Mrs. May, who chose Berlin for her first foreign trip as prime minister. The German chancellor emphasized their countries\u2019 \u201ccommon values.\u201dDuring a news conference, both women stiffly answered questions about Brexit. Then a journalist asked about their first impressions of each other. Their body language visibly loosened.Ms. Merkel laughed, and Mrs. May said, \u201cWe have two women here who, if I may say so, want to get on with the job.\u201dTheir shared gender has led to many lazy comparisons, said Rosa Prince, the author of a biography of Mrs. May that is to be published this month.\u201cWhen you are a female political leader of a certain age, you are inevitably compared to Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel,\u201d she said. \u201cTheresa May is nothing like Margaret Thatcher, but as it happens has quite a lot in common with Angela Merkel.\u201dEach cautious and deliberate, they are both childless, have quiet husbands and enjoy watching sports. (Ms. Merkel knows soccer; Mrs. May prefers cricket.)Ms. Merkel, a scientist before she went into politics, is long used to being the only woman in the room. Evelyn Roll, a German biographer of Ms. Merkel, said that, on the advice of a German actress, the chancellor had deliberately lowered the pitch of her voice to deter men from talking over her.Both women endured condescension and outright misogyny as they rose. Mrs. May has been called a \u201cbloody difficult woman\u201d by a fellow minister. Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor and mentor, Helmut Kohl, patronized her as \u201cmy girl.\u201dEven after Ms. Merkel unseated Mr. Kohl as leader of the Christian Democrats amid a party financing scandal, Germany\u2019s male-dominated news media belittled her as efficient but bland \u2014 until she took office in 2005 and gradually became \u201cMutti,\u201d the mother of the nation.\u201cThe only way men can process that a woman is in power is apparently to liken her to their mother,\u201d Ms. Roll said.Ms. Merkel, who grew up in Germany\u2019s former Communist east, has never branded herself a feminist. But on her watch Germany has introduced boardroom quotas for women and created a generous system of paid parental leave shared between mothers and fathers.In 2005, Mrs. May co-founded a group called Women2Win to elect more women to Parliament and then nurture them, something that Mrs. Thatcher was often criticized for not doing.\u201cThey are both serious people who don\u2019t grandstand, who don\u2019t play for the gallery,\u201d said Charles Grant, the director of the London-based Center for European Reform.But the few times the two women have met privately have been highly scripted affairs with little warmth on display, according to one person who was present at more than one of their meetings.\u201cTheresa May is not good at small talk,\u201d said Ms. Prince, the biographer. \u201cShe is not an easygoing, smooth person. She is not a natural diplomat.\u201dMs. Merkel, however, is said to respect Mrs. May, considering her the \u201cgrown-up\u201d in the British government, officials close to the chancellor say.For her part, Mrs. May has long expressed admiration for the German chancellor.\u201cThere are still people who don\u2019t rate her, are a bit dismissive, perhaps because of the way she looks and dresses,\u201d Mrs. May said in a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph. \u201cWhat matters is, what has she actually done? And when you look at her abilities in terms of negotiation and steering Germany through a difficult time, then hats off to her.\u201dThe two will soon be on the opposite side of the negotiations as Brexit talks commence.There is no wish in Berlin to \u201cpunish\u201d Britain for leaving, said Peter Torry, Britain\u2019s ambassador in Germany until 2007, who still lives in the German capital.But Berlin\u2019s tone has grown more distant as Britain\u2019s resolve to leave has hardened and their interests diverge.At a news conference in Malta after the European Union summit meeting on Friday, Ms. Merkel was asked whether Germany should lower its corporation tax in line with the reductions signaled by Mrs. May and Mr. Trump.\u201cWe have a tax system in Germany that is weathering challenges well,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, suggesting that well-functioning societies rely on raising a fair amount of tax.One reason for the difference between the two women\u2019s approaches may be that one is just starting out as head of government, while the other has been in office for over a decade. \u201cMay is like Merkel 10 years ago,\u201d Ms. Roll said.Though sometimes accused of lacking a vision for Europe, Ms. Merkel is calm and strategic, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 research institute in Berlin.\u201cThat\u2019s obviously helpful in a situation where we risk seeing a lot of provocations coming out of Washington over the next few years,\u201d she said.By contrast, Ms. Schwarzer added, Mrs. May seems \u201cmore tactical at this point.\u201dOne leader is consumed by preparing Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and the other with keeping the bloc together.Could they develop a pragmatic relationship during the Brexit talks and beyond?\u201cIt won\u2019t be a smooth ride,\u201d Ms. Prince said, \u201cbut it certainly has a better chance of succeeding with these two levelheaded women at the top.\u201dKatrin Bennhold reported from London, and Alison Smale from Berlin. James Kanter contributed reporting from Malta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Are the Pitfalls for the Politically Engaged Writer?", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoving EyeDoes someone want to silence us? Are we at war? Nothing is more exhilarating for a writer than to feel that simply putting pen to paper is an act of courage and a bid for freedom. Remember this novel?\u201cThe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by 25 years in a forced-labor camp. Winston .\u2008.\u2008. dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote: April 4th 1984.\u201dAnd nothing is more galvanizing for readers than to feel that they are collaborators in this bookish heroism, that reading itself is a revolutionary act. I remember in my early teens unwrapping a Christmas present from my evangelical parents to find a copy of \u201cGod\u2019s Smuggler,\u201d by Brother Andrew, an account of a Dutch Christian\u2019s adventures smuggling Bibles into the Soviet bloc. It was 1967. The idea my parents no doubt wanted to get across was that our own daily Bible reading was a brave act of subversion in a heathen world. And I must say I enjoyed \u201cGod\u2019s Smuggler\u201d rather more than the Bible. I enjoyed Brother Andrew\u2019s miraculous escapes from brutal soldiers, and at 13 I believed in the power of prayer that blinded the eyes of his persecutors. Very soon, though, to read Sade\u2019s \u201cJustine,\u201d I took the precaution of hiding the book under the bedclothes. My mother was not so easily bamboozled as those Soviet soldiers. And though she never actually confiscated anything, she would burst into tears whenever I was found to be \u201csiding with the Devil.\u201d In the years to come Lawrence, Beckett, Genet and Sartre were all best kept out of sight.Meantime, through the late 1960s and \u201970s we read Solzhenitsyn and other Soviet bloc dissidents with a sense of awe. For them writing really was a brave and dangerous thing. We imagined that in reading their books we were playing our part in a great ideological struggle. I remember my father in his unbuttoned, after-lunch ease with a copy of \u201cCancer Ward\u201d on his lap. We rejoiced when our hero was given the Nobel. It seemed right that the prizes should go to those who took risks for their freedom and their beliefs, those who spoke out: Nadine Gordimer, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Naguib Mahfouz. Perhaps we even felt a certain na\u00efve envy of artists from countries unhappier than our own. The struggle was so clear for them, the path to glory so obvious.Why mention this now?In the months I have been writing these essays for The Times (of which this is the last), I have been drawn, almost against my will, to notice the intensifying politicization of the literary world and, hand in hand with that, a predilection for melodrama, for prose that stimulates extreme emotions \u2014 in good causes of course. The cause justifies the melodrama. The melodrama serves the cause. This past year\u2019s winner of the Man Booker International Prize, \u201cThe Vegetarian,\u201d by the Korean writer Han Kang, was emblematic. A young woman is abused and victimized when she chooses to stop eating meat. Food is forced down her throat. She is raped. A patriarchal, carnivorous society cannot accept her modern sensibility. It is very hard for readers to get their allegiances wrong in this kind of narrative; hard not to feel that in buying the novel and reading and talking about it, one is doing one\u2019s bit for freedom and emancipation worldwide.The year\u2019s political upheavals contributed to this growing sense of embattlement. At a conference called European Literature Days in Wachau, Austria, in early November, participants were explicitly invited to rally against the centrifugal forces threatening to break up Europe. Anyone who felt that Brexit was not such a bad thing in the end would have been wise to keep such heresy to himself. There was definitely a new excitement in the air. People were anxious, but not perhaps unhappy. Writers were suddenly more relevant. Over lunch, a Swiss writer, Jonas L\u00fcscher, described a spat with his fellow Swiss novelist Peter Stamm. Stamm \u2014 whose wry, spare fiction I can\u2019t recommend highly enough \u2014 had given a speech insisting on the necessary separateness of art from politics; to introduce the topical and overtly political into fiction, he thought, was a form of impoverishment, or even worse, of opportunism and self-promotion. L\u00fcscher had replied by insisting on the dignity and indeed importance of the artist\u2019s political engagement. On the last evening of the conference he read from his first novel, \u201cBarbarian Spring,\u201d an account of the grotesquely extravagant wedding party of two London traders in a luxury tourist resort in Tunisia at precisely that moment in 2008 when world finance began to fall apart. It was satire in flamboyant style, and it was a rousing success with the public. We all felt pleasantly superior to those crass and irresponsible bankers. British to boot.Then Donald Trump was elected president and PEN America began to send me frequent requests to donate to their campaign to defend freedom of speech in America. Trump\u2019s election, their premise went, marks the beginning of a new war. On home territory. Very soon Americans might be presented with the kind of struggles our Soviet bloc heroes faced. Then they too would have their path to glory. One request, oddly enough, was signed by J.K. Rowling and arrived on my screen as if sent personally to me by the great lady herself. How flattering. Exhorting me to donate, Rowling (who lives in Edinburgh) wrote, \u201cWe will not go quietly and we are Louder Together!\u201dReviewing Coetzee\u2019s novel, Nadine Gordimer recognized it was \u201ca marvelous work that leaves nothing unsaid .\u2008.\u2008. about what human beings do to fellow human beings in South Africa,\u201d but then claimed that in showing \u201ca revulsion against all political and revolutionary solutions\u201d and denying recognition to the black struggle, it distorted \u201cthe integral relation between private and social destiny .\u2008.\u2008. more than is allowed for by the subjectivity that is in every writer.\u201d Replying, indirectly, in a talk given in 1987, Coetzee complained that novelists were \u201ca tribe threatened with colonization\u201d by those who would have them \u201caddress what are called problems and issues.\u201d Curiously, these are the very terms in which Stamm replied to L\u00fcscher\u2019s criticism: We are all being herded toward the big controversies, he complained. It\u2019s a loss of imagination, not a gain.In the months ahead this debate will heat up. Both as readers and as writers, each of us will react in a way congenial to our temperament. It is impossible to imagine Coetzee writing like Gordimer, L\u00fcscher like Stamm, or vice versa of course. My own position is this: Let us by all means defend our freedom of speech when and if it is threatened; but let us never confuse this engagement with our inspiration as writers or our inclination as readers. Above all, let us not get off on it.Tim Parks\u2019s most recent book is \u201cThe Novel: A Survival Skill.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel, Squeezed by Far Right, Now Faces a Rising Left", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From BerlinBERLIN \u2014 She is considered the indispensable European, yet one of the biggest questions looming over the Continent\u2019s crucial elections this year is whether Germany still regards Angela Merkel as indispensable, too.Yet suddenly, Germany\u2019s left has unexpectedly resurged, prompting Der Spiegel magazine this weekend to pose a question on its cover: \u201cWill She Fall?\u201dDespite being a largely ceremonial position, the presidency provides stature and an important platform for Mr. Steinmeier, a popular and charismatic politician. In his brief acceptance speech, he encouraged Germans to be bold in difficult times.\u201cIf we want to give others courage, then we must have some ourselves,\u201d he said on a day when many other speakers evoked the country\u2019s dark past and its emergence as a democracy after the Nazis\u2019 defeat in World War II.One marvel of traveling the world, he said, was to realize that Germany has become a model. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful that this, our difficult fatherland, is seen as an anchor of hope for many people in the world?\u201d Mr. Steinmeier said.Before the vote, the conservative head of parliament, Norbert Lammert, gave a surprisingly fiery speech that \u2014 without mentioning names \u2014 attacked Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for trying to divide or weaken Europe.\u201cWhoever champions a closed mind instead of openness to the world, whoever literally walls themselves in, bets on protectionism instead of free trade and preaches isolationism instead of states cooperating, and declares \u2018We first\u2019 as a program, should not be surprised if others do the same \u2014 with all the fatal side effects for international ties which we know from the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Lammert said. That goes, he added, for individual European states \u201cbut also for our great partner country across the Atlantic.\u201dOnce, it would have been rare for German politicians to lecture other democracies on values, especially the United States, but Germany is now regarded as a critical pillar in upholding the liberal Western order, which is one reason the Sept. 24 national elections are being watched so closely.It is also why some of Ms. Merkel\u2019s fellow conservatives quietly grumbled that she was outfoxed when she agreed to put Mr. Steinmeier forward as the presidential candidate of her grand coalition government, which unites her conservative bloc with the center-left Social Democrats. Even as the presidency stands above party politics, Mr. Steinmeier, 61, a lawyer and lifelong politician, is likely to be a boon for his party.Mr. Schulz grew up in a village in the Aachen area, becoming mayor of the nearby town of W\u00fcrselen in 1987, and likes to tell stories from those days to portray himself as an ordinary guy. He first won election to the European Parliament in 1994, going on to become president in 2012. Most unusually for a German politician, he did not finish high school with a certificate, and trained initially as a bookseller.Perhaps because he has spent most of his political career in European institutions in Brussels, Mr. Schulz can appear fresh to German voters.\u201cWhat he is doing is filling a vacuum which has obviously arisen,\u201d said Franz M\u00fcntefering, a veteran Social Democratic leader. \u201cHe is reaching people through emotions.\u201dIn its weekend cover story, Der Spiegel described the current period as \u201cthe twilight of Merkel\u201d and noted that she had appeared listless of late.Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc appears somewhat rattled. Her respected finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the longest-sitting member of Germany\u2019s parliament, used an interview in Der Spiegel this weekend to accuse Mr. Schulz of Trump-style populism.\u201cWhen Schulz lets his supporters shout, \u2018Make Europe great again,\u2019 then it is almost word for word Trump,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble told the newsmagazine.Sigmar Gabriel, the Social Democrat who has replaced Mr. Steinmeier as foreign minister, swiftly retaliated: \u201cThe radical and ill-intentioned mockery\u201d in American politics \u201cshould not be swept in to Germany,\u201d he said.Unquestionably, Mr. Trump\u2019s election has so deeply altered the geopolitical landscape for Ms. Merkel. She has kept a cool distance, and the two leaders are expected to meet for the first time this spring.As is often the case, people outside the bubble of national politics sounded considerably less stirred when asked about Ms. Merkel\u2019s standing.Metin Elcivan, 41, who helps run a corner store in western Berlin\u2019s Sch\u00f6neberg district, was certain that German voters would prove conservative. \u201cI think nothing will change at the elections,\u201d he said, \u201cand that we will have a grand coalition again, with Merkel as chancellor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Seven years later, she is in her second year of college, and law school is in reach. (With a scholarship in hand, modeling is no longer a financial requirement.)In 2009, Curtis Byers was a shy 16-year-old with a halo of hair, an aptitude for science and an allergy to school. Seven years later, the halo has been buzzed short, but the love of science remains and he is aiming for a career in veterinary care.In 2009, the oldest of the three Byers siblings, Daniel, was 17 and a student at Park West High School in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in Manhattan, where he was preparing for a career in cooking. Seven years later, he is a professional cook, with a string of restaurant jobs and catering work on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.

She took in all three as foster babies \u2014 they are genetic siblings \u2014 and formally adopted them when she was in her 60s, after her own son had grown.\u201cI guess they keep me young,\u201d she said.During a recent interview, it hardly seemed that seven years had passed, except that Ms. Byers\u2019s sons are taller. (Daniel is 6 feet 6 inches, and Curtis is just a few inches shorter.) Daniel gets Rayshell on FaceTime, and the Byerses huddle around on Ms. Byers\u2019s easy chair for a talk that defies both time and distance.Rayshell talks classes: criminal law, psychology, English, professional writing. \u201cYou can tell you\u2019re going to be a lawyer,\u201d her mother teases. \u201cYou keep talking.\u201dDaniel pulls out his personal phone, which is filled with photos of dishes he has created: his own spins on baked chicken, rice and cabbage, shrimp Alfredo, a variety of soul food dishes and lots of Mexican food. \u201cI like spicy,\u201d he said.Daniel added that he spends at least three hours a day cooking, even on days when he is not working.And that is fine with Ms. Byers, who is content to let Daniel do the shopping and the cooking, even if he is not as good with the cleaning up. Daniel\u2019s restaurant jobs mean long hours \u2014 he sometimes leaves the house at 4 a.m. \u2014 and he is trying to save for culinary school.

{"Headline": "Democratic Member to Quit Election Commission, Setting Up Political Fight", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe commissioner, Ann M. Ravel, said during an interview that she would send Mr. Trump her letter of resignation this week. She pointed to a series of deadlocked votes between the panel\u2019s three Democrats and three Republicans that she said left her little hope the group would ever be able to rein in campaign finance abuses.\u201cThe ability of the commission to perform its role has deteriorated significantly,\u201d said Ms. Ravel, who has sparred bitterly with the Republican election commissioners during her three years on the panel. She added, \u201cI think I can be more effective on the outside.\u201dHer departure will probably set off an intense political fight over how a new commissioner should be picked. By tradition, Senate Democrats would be allowed to select the replacement, but, by law, the choice belongs to the president, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in Washington customs.The outcome could have a major impact on a commission long derided for inaction, even as record amounts of money have poured into campaigns. Spending during last year\u2019s presidential and congressional races exceeded $6.9 billion, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, as \u201csuper PACs\u201d and other outside groups spent freely as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision.\u201cIt would be transformative,\u201d Mr. Hasen said, if the president nominated someone more aligned with the panel\u2019s Republican members to push for even further deregulation.Since taking office, the president has strengthened some rules on lobbying by former members of the executive branch, but ethics experts have also criticized him for failing to fully disentangle himself from his vast financial interests. Ms. Ravel acknowledged she was concerned that Mr. Trump might seek to name her replacement himself. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping that he will understand the need to appoint people who actually believe in the mission of the agency and will carry out the mandates of the law,\u201d she said, but added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201dHer claims that Republican commissioners have been unwilling to rein in obvious violations and abuses have drawn wide attention \u2014 as well as angry rebukes from those Republicans, who have accused her of grandstanding and of exaggerating the problem. The publicity even earned Ms. Ravel an appearance on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d where her interviewer suggested the commission had become as irrelevant as male nipples.Ms. Ravel said she would return to California, where she had served as a state regulator in identifying millions of dollars in \u201cdark money\u201d that flooded California elections.She considered leaving the commission last year, she said, but decided to stay through the election after President Barack Obama had asked her to do so.While Ms. Ravel will be leaving only two months shy of the end of her term, commissioners have routinely remained well past the end of their terms because of the difficulty in agreeing on replacements. All the other current members are serving well beyond the end of their terms, with one Democrat, Ellen L. Weintraub, now nearly a decade past her term\u2019s 2007 end date.By her analysis, the rate of deadlocked votes blocking \u201csubstantive\u201d enforcement actions against possible campaign violations has reached a new high of 37.5 percent. And, in such cases, she said, financial penalties against campaigns have dropped significantly over the last decade. But, as with many issues at the election commission, Ms. Ravel and her Republican counterparts are sharply at odds over the panel\u2019s performance. Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, called her analysis \u201cnonsensical and arbitrary,\u201d saying that deadlocked votes were actually far more unusual.Ms. Ravel has continued to push \u201cthe tired meme of dysfunction\u201d simply to make her political case, he said. His own data, he added, indicates that campaigns are complying with finance laws far more than before. Mr. Goodman suggested that \u201ccontrary to the spin\u201d from Democrats, \u201cthe situation has indeed changed, but for the better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skating, and Scoring, for God\u2019s Glory", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNORTH ARLINGTON, N.J. \u2014 College roller hockey teams from across the Northeast, including Pennsylvania State University, competed at an indoor arena here recently, shooting, skating and stickhandling with gusto as they battled to climb the standings and win for their teammates and for school pride.But one team, the Maccabees of Yeshiva University, was playing for something loftier \u2014 religious devotion and the quest to bring glory to Orthodox Jews.\u201cWhen we go out there, wearing Yeshiva across our chest, it reflects not just on our school but on our whole religion,\u201d Avi Margulies, 22, one of the team\u2019s founders, said after the team improved its record to 14-2.In their second season, the Maccabees, named for a band of ancient Jewish freedom fighters, are doing their faith proud and bringing athletic acclaim to this college in northern Manhattan better known for training religiously devout students than turning out powerhouse sports teams.This unlikely band of Orthodox Jewish students is tearing up the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association, against teams with few or no Jewish players and more resources.The 16-player squad was founded last season with little fanfare or financial assistance from the university. The players spend most of their time immersed in intense studies of the Talmud and the Torah, but Sundays are for hockey.Because of Sabbath restrictions, they cannot play the usual Friday and Saturday games scheduled by the league. Instead, they must play multiple games Sunday mornings, starting as early as 7 a.m. and playing up to four games, sometimes back to back against fresher teams.On a recent Sunday morning at the New Jersey rink, the Maccabees\u2019 fans far outnumbered \u2014 and stood out \u2014 from those rooting for the other teams. The men wore skullcaps and the women dressed in prim dark skirts.Joe Klein, part of a group of classmates at the rink, said the team\u2019s credo was \u201cPlay hard to pray hard\u201d and likened the team to a biblical David bringing down Goliaths.\u201cThey live for the fact that they\u2019re going to be the underdogs,\u201d said Akiva Blumenthal, another Yeshiva student.After all, most of the teams at the rink hailed from large universities like Penn State and the University of Delaware, with well-established hockey programs that receive money from their schools and are unencumbered by religious strictures.The Yeshiva team showed up at the rink before 7 a.m. and squeezed into a cramped locker room. Putting on a uniform included pulling a helmet over a yarmulke and strapping padding over a white, tasseled religious shawl, known as a tallit.They had already finished a lengthy prayer session and were facing a grueling three games.Last season, they played in Division 4, which is for newer teams. They lost one game all season and won the league championship, earning them the right to play this season in the more competitive Division 2 league against teams like Boston University and Northeastern.Still, they are currently in first place and are a favorite to win the league championships in March in Pennsylvania. The Maccabees will most likely qualify for the national championship in Florida in April, said William Bourque, the commissioner of the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association, and their performance there could enable them to move to the top division, whose teams have bigger budgets that include team buses and plane travel to games.Mr. Bourque said he was impressed by the team\u2019s quick success, especially since new teams typically struggle to achieve a winning record.\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that a team comes in and becomes a top team right away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably the hardest-working team out there. They probably don\u2019t have the most talented players, but they have the best teamwork. They want it more than anyone else.\u201dThe game is essentially played on an ice hockey rink with a hard surface. Body checking is forbidden but play is still scrappy, with plenty of contact. Players use a hard plastic puck and wear in-line skates and padding.Maccabee players and supporters regard the team\u2019s unlikely accomplishment as something of a miracle.\u201cGrowing up as an Orthodox kid, you can\u2019t play in the roller hockey leagues because they don\u2019t cater to the orthodox lifestyle,\u201d said Amir Gavarin, who also helped start the team and is the captain. \u201cSo you wonder if you can play with the gentiles. We\u2019re trying to prove to the community that we can hang with them.\u201dThe team is largely an outgrowth of the avid floor hockey scene in orthodox high schools in and around New York City. Some top players who ended up attending Yeshiva University were recruited by Mr. Margulies and Mr. Gavarin.Many of the players, including one of the goalies, Joseph Robin, had to develop skating skills. Two of the team\u2019s stars, Avi Edell and Ari Drazin, grew up in Canada playing ice hockey and had to learn how to play on wheels instead of blades.Being a club rather than a varsity sport means the team is not eligible for athletic department funding, school officials said. Still, the team is hoping to persuade the school to provide some financing, Mr. Gavarin said.The players had to raise money to buy uniforms and equipment, pay league fees, cover travel expenses and even to hire a coach, Ely Gemara.League officials warned the Yeshiva players that holding games on Sunday mornings could mean having to play before sunrise.\u201cWe told them, \u2018Guys, it\u2019s going to be really, really hard,\u2019 but they\u2019ve taken everything in stride,\u201d Mr. Bourque said.Because of the players\u2019 rigorous study schedules, it has been tough to schedule practices, and rental fees are steep at rinks on Long Island and in New Jersey. They also practice at an outdoor public rink on First Avenue in Manhattan.This season, the team had to skip preseason games because they fell during the High Holy Days in October.Players said their travel logistics could be as challenging as their opponents. While other teams show up in team vans, the Maccabees scramble to assemble car pools.With kosher and Sabbath restrictions, even hotel stays are tricky. Team members often stay with orthodox families, sometimes sleeping on attic floors or in cold garages.There was also the necessity of packing their own kosher food \u2014 which usually meant cold meals \u2014 and fitting morning, afternoon and evening prayer sessions between car trips to games across the Northeast.The toll of travel hit the team at its very first game, in Rhode Island. After praying in a cold, dark parking lot, the team seemed in a daze as their opponents scored 15 seconds into the game.The Maccabees, however, woke up and rallied to a lopsided 23-5 victory. By season\u2019s end, several of the players won league honors, but could not attend a Friday night banquet. Instead, league officials presented the awards the following Sunday in a locker room.There have been awkward moments. Last season, at a rink on Long Island, the opposing team could not conceal its surprise after walking into a locker room to find the Maccabees in full-throated prayer together in Hebrew.\u201cYou should have seen the shock on their faces,\u201d Mr. Gavarin said.Some hard-core fans travel hours to road games.At the rink in New Jersey, they were crestfallen when the team blew a 4-1 lead against Stony Brook University, and lost 5-4 in overtime. But they revived when the Maccabees beat Delaware University and trounced Penn State in a game that featured Mr. Drazin and Jesse Gordon combining on a dazzling Maccabees goal.The two players initially met while studying the Talmud in Israel before playing together. Now they make up the team\u2019s first offensive line.Mr. Gavarin acquired his love for the game from his father, Barry Gavarin, who began playing a primitive form of hockey at his own yeshiva in the 1960s, first kicking the puck on an outdoor makeshift ice rink and then buying sticks and skates with his classmates as a break from religious study.The younger Mr. Gavarin said he and his teammates considered being both devout Jews and ferocious competitors a way to encourage other young observant Jews to break out of the often \u201cinsulated\u201d world of Orthodox Jewish life.\u201cWe\u2019re opening up a whole new viewpoint and worldview for Orthodox kids,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Gavarin said, \u201cbecause they can see that if you work hard enough you can play with anybody.\u201dAn article on Feb. 6 about the success of Yeshiva University\u2019s roller hockey team misspelled the surname of a player. He is Ari Drazin, not Drazen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Quiet Giant of Investing Weighs In on Trump", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookHe is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of. His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $795 on Amazon, and a new copy sells for as much as $3,500.Perhaps that\u2019s why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump \u2014 and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry \u2014 has quietly become the most sought-after reading material on Wall Street.He is Seth A. Klarman, the 59-year-old value investor who runs Baupost Group, which manages some $30 billion.While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as \u201cThe Oracle of Boston,\u201d where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised.In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing \u201cperilously high valuations.\u201d\u201cExuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from America-first protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers,\u201d he wrote.\u201cPresident Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhile they might be popular, the reason the U.S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don\u2019t work, they actually leave society worse off.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of pro-growth policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump\u2019s stimulus efforts \u201ccould prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors.\u201dAnd he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy\u2019s growth over the long term.\u201cThe Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cThe large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today\u2019s artificially low levels.\u201dMuch of Mr. Klarman\u2019s anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership style. He described it this way: \u201cThe erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound decision-making.\u201dHe also linked this point \u2014 which is a fair one \u2014 to what \u201cTrump style\u201d means for Mr. Klarman\u2019s constituency and others.\u201cThe big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he\u2019s apparently deliberately so; he says it\u2019s part of his plan.\u201dWhile Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, \u201cIf things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst.\u201dMr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner.While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: \u201cHis words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president.\u201dIn his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. \u201cDespite my preference to stay out of the media,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander.\u201dFrom the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund\u2019s money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years.What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election \u2014 about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet \u2014 wrongly so far \u2014 that the stock market would fall; he lost about $1 billion.Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes \u2014 he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s index \u2014 he blamed the influx of money into the industry.\u201cWith any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cNo surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured.\u201dHe continued, \u201cTo many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product.\u201dThe lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity.Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes \u2014 at least that finance geeks will appreciate \u2014 is what he says is the irony that investors now \u201chave gotten excited about market-hugging index funds and exchange traded funds (E.T.F.s) that mimic various market or sector indices.\u201dHe says he sees big trouble ahead in this area \u2014 or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit.\u201cOne of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E.T.F. activity is that it will tend to \u2018lock in\u2019 today\u2019s relative valuations between securities,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote.\u201cWhen money flows into an index fund or index-related E.T.F., the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership),\u201d he wrote. \u201cThus today\u2019s high-multiple companies are likely to also be tomorrow\u2019s, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings.\u201dTo Mr. Klarman, \u201cstocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it.\u201d\u201cThis should give long-term value investors a distinct advantage,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become.\u201dHow Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here\u2019s a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: \u201cIn matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.\u201dThe DealBook column on Tuesday, about the investor Seth A. Klarman, referred incorrectly in some copies to a statement he issued criticizing Donald J. Trump last year. It was related to Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of a judge\u2019s Mexican heritage, not a recording in which Mr. Trump talked about groping women.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Trump the Nationalist, a Trail of Global Trademarks", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Donald J. Trump has cast himself as the anti-globalist president.But Donald Trump, the businessman, is a different story.During the campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s organization continued to file dozens of new trademarks, in China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Indonesia, and one of his companies applied for trademark protection in the Philippines more than a month after the election, a review of foreign records by The New York Times showed.\u201cTrump seems to be the archetypal businessman with mercantilist instincts,\u201d Dani Rodrik, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said in an email. \u201c\u2018Open your market for me to do business in it, but you can have access to mine only on my terms.\u2019\u201dThe Times review of nine databases identified nearly 400 foreign trademarks registered to Trump companies since 2000 in 28 countries, among them New Zealand, Egypt and Russia, as well as the European Union. There are most likely many more trademarks, because there is no central repository of all trademarks from every country. The Trump Organization has been filing trademarks for decades, and has said that it has taken out trademarks in more than 80 countries.\u201cOver the last 20-plus years, the Trump Organization has filed trademarks in numerous locations,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAlthough the company will not be doing any new international deals, it will continue to take steps to protect its various brands.\u201dThe organization did not address specific questions posed about deals that emerged from the trademarks.Some of the trademarks hinted at previously unknown foreign forays. While Mr. Trump assailed Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign for her connections to Brunei, he explored opportunities in the country, taking out a trademark covering several categories used for real estate projects, the review showed.The Trump Organization also has international designs for its new Scion hotel brand. The organization took out trademarks last year for Scion in Indonesia, the European Union, China and Canada, though an executive recently said expanding domestically would be the focus while Mr. Trump is in office.Sometimes Mr. Trump\u2019s trademarks are markers for ventures that never materialized or construction projects underway where he is licensing his name. Other times they appear to be part of a defensive strategy to ward off trademark infringement.Some trademarks reinforce that for Mr. Trump, the \u201cart of the deal\u201d has often proved elusive overseas. His record is littered with numerous failed or stalled projects, including development deals in Cozumel and Baja California, Mexico, in Russia and in Brazil.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a candidate who was aggressively seeking large quantities of these foreign government intellectual property protections during the campaign, and who through the businesses he will continue to own will not only seek to maintain but expand those, presumably,\u201d Mr. Eisen said.Being an \u201cAmerica First\u201d president with a past as a globe-trotting businessman can make for problematic appearances.Mr. Trump has also made corporate plays in places that have been in his political sights. During the campaign, he assailed Mrs. Clinton and her family foundation for taking donations from Brunei, whose government, he said, \u201chas pushed oppressive Shariah law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.\u201dBut Mr. Trump himself has had an eye on the country, taking out a trademark there in 2007 covering categories that included contracting, financing and engineering services, records show.Dana E. Stewart, president of Global Trademarks Inc., the firm that filed the Brunei trademarks, said in an interview: \u201cI would have no idea of the purpose and the nature of the filing. We are instructed to file and we do that.\u201dAs for Mexico, though Mr. Trump is moving forward aggressively with his plan to build a wall along its border with the United States, the country has been one of his most frequent business targets over the years. In the last decade, his company filed 25 trademarks, including some for two failed resort ventures as well as his Donald J. Trump Signature Collection clothing line, alcohol and furniture.In China, the large number of trademarks filed during the campaign were in categories including restaurants, bars, hotels, brokerage services, advertising and management consulting.Spring Chang, founder of Chang Tsi & Partners, a Beijing-based law firm that has represented the Trump Organization, said she did not want to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s specific trademarks. But she said she encouraged a \u201cdefensive strategy\u201d for her clients to prevent a celebrity\u2019s name from becoming treated as a generic term.But his strategy in the country certainly has not been entirely defensive. \u201cMade a lot of money in China,\u201d he once boasted during the campaign, adding, \u201cI deal with Europe, I deal with Asia, I deal with China all the time.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about trademarks taken out around the world by President Trump\u2019s companies referred incorrectly to a potential reason for those applications. Sometimes the efforts appear to be part of a defensive strategy to ward off trademark infringement, not copyright infringement.Danny Hakim reported from London, and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing.

Gorsuch was not commenting on Mr. Trump\u2019s denigration of judges when he said he was disheartened by attacks on the courts.Major League Baseball would closely scrutinize the complicated financing behind the deal and probably seek to ensure that Charles Kushner, the family patriarch who has spent time in prison for illegal campaign donations, tax evasion and witness tampering, was not involved.The potential deal has also raised questions about whether the link to President Trump would be a benefit to the team.According to federal ethics rules, an employee of the government\u2019s executive branch cannot use public office for personal gain, or endorse products or services on behalf of friends or relatives.The White House even \u201ccounseled\u201d her in an unusual show of displeasure after she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody; you can find it online.\u201dMs. Conway was responding to a clash with Nordstrom, which had stopped stocking Ms. Trump\u2019s line.The president also waded into the issue, sending signals about dealing with the administration as well as his family.Durex condoms and Enfamil baby formula are being brought under one roof.The deal increases Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s share of developing markets, making China its second-largest market after the United States.It would also bolster its stable of \u201cpower brands,\u201d which make up about 80 percent of its revenue, adding Mead Johnson\u2019s Enfamil to Durex, Air Wick air fresheners and Lysol cleaning products.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Warren Buffett of Brazil\u2019 Behind the Offer for Unilever", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJorge Paulo Lemann may be the richest man in Brazil but he does not have the same pop culture status on American shores as the investor Warren E. Buffett.Yet Mr. Lemann\u2019s investment firm, 3G Capital, and Mr. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, are the architects of some of the biggest mergers of household names in American food and drink in recent memory.Now, the deal makers are poised for what would be their biggest feat yet.On Friday, Kraft Heinz disclosed that it had made a $143 billion offer for Unilever, the maker of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, Lipton tea and Dove soap, a global combination that would create one of the world\u2019s largest food companies.Unilever has turned down the offer, but this could just be the opening salvo. In a statement confirming its offer, Kraft said, \u201cWe look forward to working to reach agreement on the terms of a transaction.\u201dMr. Lemann, 77, a Harvard-educated former Brazilian tennis champion, ranks 19th on the Forbes list of world billionaires, with a fortune estimated at $29 billion. He and his partners at 3G have developed over the years what many call a playbook for extracting costs from companies by eliminating frivolities like corporate-owned aircraft and expensive office space, revamping management and slashing jobs.They instill strict austerity that forces managers to justify expenses beyond basic operating needs. Their model makes expansion overseas crucial for increasing returns.They have also focused on major consumer brands rather than on diversifying. Mr. Lemann, who was born in Brazil but now lives in Switzerland, and Mr. Buffett, nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha, served on the board of the razor maker Gillette years ago. In the 1970s, Mr. Lemann founded an investment bank in Brazil and later sold it to Credit Suisse before starting his investment firm in 2004.Glimmers of the 3G playbook were at work in InBev\u2019s takeover of the St. Louis-based Anheuser Busch, when Mr. Lemann brought a team of Brazilian managers in and eliminated more than 1,000 jobs. He replaced the chief executive of Heinz with a 3G partner and cut 7,000 jobs there.A 3G founding partner, Alex Behring, is chairman of Restaurant Brands, the parent of Burger King, as well as the chairman of Kraft Heinz and a board member at Anheuser-Busch. Mr. Lemann is the controlling shareholder and board member at Anheuser and a board member at Kraft.Mr. Lemann and Mr. Buffett share a similar investment philosophy: patience. Instead of selling his portfolio after he has cut and remodeled companies, Mr. Lemann has used Anheuser-Busch InBev and now Kraft Heinz as base camps for further global expansion. As recently as December, Kraft Heinz was rumored to be looking around, and many thought the target would be Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Ritz Crackers.Hostile situations do not bother 3G. In 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made several unsuccessful approaches to SABMiller before the two beer makers merged, offering to bring it into growing markets in Africa and Latin America. SAB demurred, but eventually the deal was made.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macy\u2019s Is Said to Receive Takeover Approach by Hudson\u2019s Bay", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Macy\u2019s of today grew from the union of several great names in American retailing, including its namesake chain, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Marshall Field\u2019s.But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further, combining with Macy\u2019s to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling. Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, the Canadian owner of Saks, has approached Macy\u2019s about a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday.Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale. While it is unclear whether a deal will happen, a combination could lift the fortunes of Macy\u2019s, the country\u2019s biggest department store, which has been struggling.Investors certainly appeared to see it that way. Shares of Macy\u2019s rose as much as 12 percent on Friday, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11, according to data from Bloomberg.Once a retail titan, Macy\u2019s has struggled to remain relevant as e-commerce and discount retailers have decimated the traditional brick-and-mortar business.Since the recession, shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price. Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished. Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices, which cuts into their margins.Departments stores have been hit especially hard, particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls. What has emerged, analysts say, is a virtual race to the bottom.That has been particularly difficult for Macy\u2019s, born of a series of mergers over the past two decades that made it a juggernaut in the industry. A stalwart of the middle tier of retail, the company has neither the advantages of low-cost retailers like H&M nor the highest-end stores.Macy\u2019s has taken some steps to sell or redevelop stores, and last year, it added an expert on real estate transactions to its board. But the company has largely resisted more ambitious efforts to divest its real estate, including so-called sale-leaseback deals, in which a company sells the underlying land beneath its stores and then rents it back.The company\u2019s suitor, Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, is far smaller \u2014 its market value was about 1.9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1.5 billion \u2014 but is known for its bold steps. Hudson\u2019s Bay Company has assembled a growing empire that includes the Hudson\u2019s Bay department store chain, Lord & Taylor and its crown jewel, Saks.Financing a bid for Macy\u2019s may be trickier, however, because the it carries about $6.5 billion in long-term debt. That may mean that the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company will have to bring in a partner or borrow against more of its real estate holdings.A representative for Starboard Value did not respond to a request for comment.Some analysts said that they saw the merit of a potential combination, particularly given Macy\u2019s operational woes and Mr. Baker\u2019s expertise in wringing money out of real estate.\u201cThere is a clear logic, despite disparity in size/market cap\u201d between Macy\u2019s and Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm, said in a note.Referring to Macy\u2019s stock ticker symbol, he added, \u201cThe retail market has been changing faster than M has been able to keep up with, whether the flight from the mall or the migration online.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio May Be Interviewed by Federal Prosecutors on Friendly Turf", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio will probably be on familiar ground when he is questioned by federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents in New York as part of a sweeping criminal investigation into his campaign fund-raising.It was unclear when exactly the interview would take place, but it was expected to be conducted in a conference room at offices of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s lawyer\u2019s firm in Midtown Manhattan, people with knowledge of the matter have said, not in the offices of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. It was expected that the interview would last about four hours, the people said.The parameters of the session took shape after extensive negotiations between prosecutors and the mayor\u2019s lawyer, Barry H. Berke, the people said, and it was possible that some details could change.The prosecutors overseeing the fund-raising investigation have been examining whether the mayor or others in his administration traded favorable city action for donations to his campaign or to his now-defunct nonprofit political group. They want to question the mayor about more than a dozen topics, several of the people have said.It was unclear, however, whether the negotiations that led to the meeting resulted in any sort of set agenda.The offices of Mr. Berke, of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, should be well known to the Mr. de Blasio: He held fund-raisers there in 2013 and 2014, and three meetings in 2014 and 2015, according to his public schedules.Some donors who were at the first fund-raiser there have come under scrutiny in the federal inquiry. It was unclear whether the second event came under similar scrutiny, but it was probably of interest to prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which has been conducting a separate inquiry.But Mr. de Blasio, who has repeatedly defended his own conduct and that of his aides and has said his administration was cooperating with the inquiry, has declined several times to say when the meeting would occur or what might be discussed.\u201dI don\u2019t know what specific questions they\u2019ll ask,\u201d he said on NY1, \u201cbut I do know this: From the very beginning of these investigations, I\u2019ve said we did everything right, my team did everything right, I did everything right to abide by the law and comport ourselves in an ethical fashion.\u201d\u201cSo whatever topics they want to raise, I\u2019m ready to talk about them,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the bottom line is we made the decisions based on the needs of the people \u2014 that\u2019s how I\u2019ve done things throughout my public life \u2014 and I think I\u2019ll be able to clarify that for them.\u201dIt is unusual for federal prosecutors to question a subject of a criminal investigation in the offices of the subject\u2019s lawyer. Such sessions, which can become contentious, are almost always conducted in the prosecutor\u2019s offices. It was unclear why the federal prosecutors agreed to hold the meeting at the Kramer Levin offices.Spokesmen for Mr. Bharara\u2019s office and the F.B.I. declined to comment.A federal grand jury has already heard some testimony in connection with the fund-raising investigation, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, few details were available about the witnesses who have appeared so far, the substance of their testimony or the nature of other evidence that may have been presented.It was also unclear whether the panel had been asked or would be asked to weigh charges against the mayor or any of his senior aides in connection with the inquiry.People briefed on the federal investigation have said that prosecutors and F.B.I. agents have largely narrowed their focus to three of roughly a dozen aspects of the mayor\u2019s fund-raising and other issues that they have examined over the last 10 months or so.Advertisement"}

Cohen, perhaps the most successful hedge fund investor of the modern era, who amassed wealth of some $13 billion. Her book, \u201cBlack Edge: Inside Information, Dirty Money, and the Quest to Bring Down the Most Wanted Man on Wall Street,\u201d is a richly reported, entertaining tale about the cat-and-mouse game between the government and Cohen \u2014 much of which played out in the news media \u2014 for the greater part of the last decade, if not longer.\u201cBlack Edge,\u201d which at times reads like a thriller, is a fascinating look at Cohen, whom Kolhatkar portrays as an obsessive and ruthless investor. After he divorced his first wife, Kolhatkar reports, Cohen told his staff: \u201cI just got ripped off by my wife. I\u2019m going to make it all back by cutting your payouts.\u201d Her book is also a deep examination of a culture within hedge funds that demanded employees find an \u201cedge,\u201d and seemingly continued to rely on illegal tips by insiders \u2014 information that was called \u201cblack edge\u201d in Cohen\u2019s firm \u2014 for far too long.If you\u2019ve kept up with the headlines about Cohen over the years, you know the ending of Kolhatkar\u2019s tale in advance: The government never brings a case against him. That reality, to some degree, gets in the way of an otherwise good story \u2014 and in the end makes it not nearly as satisfying as \u201cDen of Thieves.\u201d Cohen is never proved guilty of breaking the law, despite a litany of circumstantial evidence presented by prosecutors and the author. The reader is left asking: Why not?In many ways, \u201cBlack Edge\u201d is the story of a trial that never happened, a case that was never brought. It illuminates just how difficult it is to prosecute white-collar crimes. Kolhatkar describes in great detail meetings among F.B.I. agents and government lawyers all seeking to find enough evidence to prosecute Cohen.This book works, to the extent that it does, because Kolhatkar piles detail after detail upon one another. That\u2019s how she gets a reader to feel like he is in the room. However, too much of the time the reader seems to be in the wrong room, and that\u2019s a major problem.Kolhatkar never spoke with Cohen, and many of his closest associates appear to have been scared off talking to her. \u201cSteve Cohen did not cooperate in the reporting process,\u201d she writes, \u201cin spite of multiple requests over a three-year period, one of them conducted through an in-person encounter at Christie\u2019s. Cohen tried to prevent members of his closest circle from speaking with me, and at one point, a press representative working for Cohen threatened to have me followed.\u201d There is also very little from Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York \u2014 who, in Kolhatkar\u2019s telling, seemed as if he was on a life mission to put Cohen away.As a result, Kolhatkar is left relying on a string of F.B.I. agents and lawyers as sources to accomplish what amounts to a sleight of hand: She layers enough juicy little anecdotes and descriptions \u2014 \u201cI want his pickled shark. I want to put his shark up in the office,\u201d she quotes Richard Zabel, one of the prosecutors, saying \u2014 to make you feel you\u2019re getting an insider\u2019s look. But if you\u2019re paying attention, when any given chapter is over you realize that far too often you have never gleaned what Cohen or Bharara was doing \u2014 or thinking \u2014 at the most pivotal moments. And given that the prosecutors never get their man, understanding how Cohen personally mounted a stealth defense that kept him from ever stepping into a courtroom was the mystery that required solving.At one point, Kolhatkar gets close to an explanation for the gaps in her narrative. She recounts a fascinating meeting in which Cohen\u2019s lead lawyer, Martin Klotz, explains to prosecutors how he would defend his client if they bring a case. Surprisingly, the lead prosecutor in the room seems nonplused by the lawyer\u2019s arguments, which raise questions about whether his client had actually read an email about a piece of inside information or, indeed, whether the material could legally constitute inside information.Describing the defense\u2019s strategy, the prosecutor sarcastically says: \u201cI might have been in the bank, and I might have had a mask, and I might have had a gun, but that doesn\u2019t mean I robbed the bank.\u201d Yet moments later, Kolhatkar writes that \u201chearing Klotz lay it all out, much the way he would in front of a jury, was a hard dose of reality. After years of agonizing work, they didn\u2019t quite have the evidence they felt they needed to convict Steve Cohen. Not in a criminal case, anyhow.\u201dHuh?It is such missing pieces that undermine what is otherwise a well-told story. What\u2019s more, if you\u2019re looking for a great revelation or a headline, you will be disappointed. Kolhatkar doesn\u2019t find anything more than what\u2019s already out there, and she seems to acknowledge as much. In explaining why one of Cohen\u2019s lieutenants, Mathew Martoma, refused to turn on him rather than go to jail, she is left speculating: \u201cPerhaps Martoma simply could not accept the idea of being an informant,\u201d she writes. \u201cPerhaps Martoma believed he would face some kind of retribution if he crossed Cohen.\u201d Then she adds \u201canother hypothesis.\u201d Maybe \u201cMartoma harbored a desperate hope that Cohen would repay his loyalty.\u201d Ultimately she concludes, \u201cFor now Martoma\u2019s motivations remain a mystery.\u201dThe best insider fly-on-the-wall books work on two levels: They appeal to the layman with a passing interest in the subject because of the sheer drama of the story. But they also wow sophisticated insiders (excuse the wordplay) with new details that make them rethink what they knew about the topic. This book may work on the first level, but it doesn\u2019t work on the second.Andrew Ross Sorkin is a financial columnist for The Times, the author of \u201cToo Big to Fail,\u201d the co-creator of Showtime\u2019s \u201cBillions\u201d and the co-anchor of CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buffett Asks Big Money: Why Pay High Fees?", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookPoof: $100 billion disappeared.That\u2019s the figure that Warren E. Buffett recently calculated that pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals have lost over the last decade to hedge funds and other money managers that charge sky-high fees.The letter, which ricocheted around Wall Street to the consternation of some and the applause of others, was Mr. Buffett\u2019s most damning assessment of the hedge fund industry to date, and it came amid a growing debate about whether professional money managers are capable of outperforming the stock market on even a semiregular basis.As many investors know, recent failures of these managers to do so has caused all manner of problems \u2014 a devastation that Mr. Buffett described pointedly in his note.\u201cMuch of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany of these funds are woefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performance accompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by local taxpayers.\u201dFor the past several years, Mr. Buffett has told anyone who will listen to avoid attempting to beat the stock market by investing in hedge funds or actively managed funds. Instead, he has counseled buying a low-cost S. & P. 500 index fund. (He has said he plans to advise the trustee of his estate after he dies to invest 90 percent of it in an S. & P. 500 index fund and the rest into government bonds on behalf of his wife.)However, much of the biggest money in the nation hasn\u2019t taken his advice and continues to pay enormous fees for underperformance.In his letter, Mr. Buffett offered an unusually cogent, honest and blunt appraisal of the human behavior that drives individuals with money to avoid index funds \u2014 and their willingness to pay huge fees.\u201cThe wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling, entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote. \u201cTheir money, they feel, should buy them something superior compared to what the masses receive.\u201dHe continued, \u201cThe financial \u2018elites\u2019 \u2014 wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like \u2014 have great trouble meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few thousand dollars.\u201dMr. Buffett said that wealthy individuals get drawn in by consultants selling them big promises. \u201cCan you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S. & P. 500?\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so.\u201dThat advice, Mr. Buffett added, \u201cis often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment \u2018styles\u2019 or current economic trends make the shift appropriate.\u201dMr. Buffett\u2019s index-loving advice may seem counterintuitive coming from a man who is considered the most successful investor in history \u2014 and who became so by actively making individual bets in the market.It also may be hard to square given that millions of people follow Mr. Buffett\u2019s words \u2014 and tens of thousands of them make an annual pilgrimage to Omaha to his annual meeting \u2014 looking for pearls of wisdom that they can use themselves to beat the market.Mr. Buffett has long offered guidance about investing, and he often makes it sound easy. \u201cSuccess in investing doesn\u2019t correlate with I.Q. once you\u2019re above the level of 25,\u201d he once said \u2014 but it seems even he recognizes that some investors who follow his principles may not succeed.\u201cThere are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to outperform the S. & P. over long stretches. In my lifetime, though, I\u2019ve identified \u2014 early on \u2014 only 10 or so professionals that I expected would accomplish this feat,\u201d he wrote.Perhaps Mr. Buffett\u2019s advice is being taken: Last year, according to Morningstar, about $505 billion flooded into index funds and exchange-traded funds; $340 billion was pulled from active money managers.Of course, if everyone buys index funds, what would it do to the market?And therein lies the rub: That inefficiency is where active investors like Mr. Buffett make money. \u201cI\u2019d be a bum on the street with a tin cup if markets were efficient,\u201d Mr. Buffett once said.Still, Mr. Buffett is not convinced the big money will take his advice and buy index funds \u2014 thereby giving up the dream of trying to beat the market.\u201cHuman behavior won\u2019t change,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWealthy individuals, pension funds, endowments and the like will continue to feel they deserve something \u2018extra\u2019 in investment advice. Those advisers who cleverly play to this expectation will get very rich.\u201dMr. Buffett observed: \u201cThis year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else. The likely result from this parade of promises is predicted in an adage: \u2018When a person with money meets a person with experience, the one with experience ends up with the money, and the one with money leaves with experience.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Canadian City Thrives on Gas, Like a \u2018Wealthy Little Country\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedicine Hat JournalMEDICINE HAT, Alberta \u2014 This isolated river city smack dab in the middle of Alberta\u2019s badlands is a little bit like Norway. Both have sizable oil and gas reserves that spin big money relative to their small populations.\u201cWe could separate from the world, and we\u2019d be totally self-sufficient,\u201d said Ted Clugston, the mayor, sipping coffee in Medicine Hat\u2019s award-winning, architectural designed brick-and-glass City Hall. \u201cWe\u2019d be a very, very wealthy little country, except we have no military.\u201dMedicine Hat is one of the last cities in North America to own its energy resources; it has more than 4,000 gas wells and hopes to grow its oil production from 1,500 to as much as 5,000 barrels of oil a day.It has its own gas-fired power plant and is a leader in municipally owned renewable energy, with a wind farm and a solar thermal power plant. The city even provides incentives to homeowners to buy solar electric panels.The city\u2019s curious name comes from an indigenous legend that a Blackfoot shaman lost his feathered war bonnet \u2014 called a medicine hat by early settlers \u2014 in a battle with the Cree and that the headdress was later found near an oxbow bend in the river. The place became known as Medicine Hat.But it is what is under the city that really sets it apart: massive reserves of natural gas.The indigenous people of the plains knew there was something mysterious in the ground around here because lightning strikes would occasionally set off gas flares that burned brilliantly until snuffed out by wind or rain. They called the gas vents \u201cburning springs.\u201dThen in 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railway bridged the South Saskatchewan River at Medicine Hat and dug a well farther west looking for water to replenish steam engines on the dry plains. They instead struck gas, \u201cwhich, on taking fire emits a flame sufficient to light up the surrounding country,\u201d a newspaper reported at the time.The railroad kept digging wells and hitting gas, which it primarily used to create flares to dazzle visitors. After witnessing one such display, Rudyard Kipling famously wrote, \u201cThis part of the country seems to have all hell for a basement, and the only trap door is Medicine Hat.\u201dThe first wells were shallow and the gas was mixed with water, which would freeze in the winter, making distribution impossible. Then in 1904, the town fathers decided to drill a deeper well.At 1,000 feet, the coffers ran dry, but the mayor said he would find more money and ordered the drilling to continue. Ten feet later, the drill hit gas, spitting the drill bit out of the ground like a watermelon seed. The mayor was just getting dressed and ran down to the well with his suspenders hanging around his knees, according to a city historian.Remarkably, the city turned down a bid by a private company to buy the gas franchise and instead decided to develop it as a public utility. The city raised money to install gas lines that ran through buildings and from home to home. Street lamps burned around the clock because the gas was so plentiful it was less expensive than turning them off and relighting them daily, a reality that earned Medicine Hat a mention in \u201cRipley\u2019s Believe It or Not!\u201d (The gas mantles in the lamps have since been replaced by light-emitting diodes.)Learning how to safely harness the invisible, odorless resource took some time. Many a building was blown to matchwood because of leaking gas. In 1908, a mattress factory exploded.Medicine Hat, by then incorporated as a city, started offering industry tax holidays, free building sites and free natural gas; thousands of factories came. Vincent Scully, a former Irish politician, declared that Medicine Hat would become \u201cthe Pittsburgh of Western Canada,\u201d and for a while, it looked as if he might have been right. By the time the Great War began, Medicine Hat factories were producing dozens of products, \u201cfrom manhole covers to candy,\u201d according to Medicine Hat\u2019s history museum.One of the first was a brick factory, the largest in Canada at the time, which took advantage of the region\u2019s other natural resource: rich deposits of clay along the South Saskatchewan River basin. But the city\u2019s real heyday came during the energy crisis of the 1970s when fertilizer, methanol and other petrochemical plants moved to \u201cthe Hat\u201d to take advantage of the affordable fuel.The prairie that stretches out from the city is dotted with gas wells today, marked by U-shaped pipes sticking out of the ground like abandoned hitching posts. Some of the wells have been producing gas for over a hundred years.\u201cThere\u2019s not much that we\u2019re wanting for,\u201d said Bill Cocks, a city councilor and chairman of the city\u2019s energy and utilities committee, who said he was sometimes introduced at provincial meetings as \u201cAlderman Cocks from the Independent Principality of Medicine Hat.\u201dMr. Cocks is president of the Cypress Club, a leather-and-trophy-head-bedecked private club founded in 1903 that has long been the social hub of Medicine Hat power brokers.Income from the oil and gas sales funds much of the municipal budget, allowing Medicine Hat to keep taxes low \u2014 it has the lowest property taxes of any major municipality in Canada. When energy prices were high, the city built up about 500 million Canadian dollars in reserves.But then prices plummeted and the profits evaporated, and this year Medicine Hat faced a budget shortfall for the first time in memory. The city will close the gap with reserves and raise property taxes by 2 percent annually for the next 10 years, but the shortfall served as a warning to the City Council.As a result, Medicine Hat is setting up a \u201cheritage fund,\u201d similar to the sovereign wealth funds operated by Norway, China, Singapore and other wealthy countries. The city won provincial approval to invest in stocks, a privilege allowed to only two other cities in Alberta: Calgary and Edmonton, each more than a dozen times Medicine Hat\u2019s size.Once money goes into the fund, it cannot come out \u2014 only dividends can. But over time, the city hopes the fund will grow and that dividends will eventually cover a lot of the city budget, maybe someday even making property taxes a thing of the past.\u201cWe\u2019ll start capturing the value of those depletable assets,\u201d said Brian Mastel, the finance commissioner, \u201cand monetize them into an endowment fund for the community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Democrats Delay Confirmation of Mnuchin and Price", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats significantly escalated tensions with the White House on Tuesday, stalling action on two of President Trump\u2019s most important cabinet nominees, Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary and Representative Tom Price to be secretary of health and human services.Democrats boycotted a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee that had been scheduled to vote on the two nominees. They said they had been misled by the nominees and wanted an opportunity to investigate unanswered questions about Mr. Price\u2019s investments and Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s role in a bank that has been criticized for aggressive foreclosure practices.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said Mr. Mnuchin had \u201cout-and-out lied to our committee\u201d about the robotic signing of foreclosure documents by the bank, OneWest, when he was its chief executive.The chairman of the committee, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said the Democrats were \u201cvery upset with Donald Trump\u201d and had therefore \u201ccrippled his administration right out of the box\u201d by delaying and obstructing approval of some of his nominees.\u201cYou have to go back to the Civil War to find things like this,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Looking at empty seats in the committee room normally occupied by Democrats, Mr. Hatch described their stall tactics as \u201cthe most pathetic thing\u201d he had seen in his 40 years in the Senate.Under Finance Committee rules, the panel needs a quorum, including at least one member of the minority party, to conduct business.Democrats have no immediate prospect of stopping Trump nominees, but by dragging out the confirmation process, they said, they can slow Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to carry out policies that many Democrats adamantly oppose.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said Democrats were \u201cmanufacturing issues on a daily basis\u201d to string out the confirmation process and to hobble Mr. Trump.

The cabinet appointments are going to be approved.\u201dDemocrats forced a delay of at least one day in a Judiciary Committee vote on Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama.But other Trump nominees advanced on Tuesday. By a vote of 93 to 6, the Senate approved the nomination of Elaine L. Chao to be secretary of transportation.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said that Ms. Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush, was \u201ca part of the Senate family\u201d because she is married to Mr. McConnell. Mr. McConnell voted \u201cpresent.\u201d But the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, voted against Ms. Chao, saying she had refused to publicly state her position on Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order closing the nation\u2019s borders to refugees and to people from certain predominantly Muslim countries.By a vote of 12 to 11, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions recommended confirmation of Betsy DeVos to be education secretary. Ms. DeVos, a Republican fund-raiser and donor, has been a champion of charter schools and vouchers, which give families public funds to help pay tuition at private schools.Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, won backing from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which voted 16 to 7 to recommend his confirmation. And by a vote of 16 to 6, that committee approved Representative Ryan Zinke, Republican of Montana, to lead the Interior Department. Another Senate committee voted 18 to 1 to approve Linda McMahon, a former wrestling entertainment executive, to be head of the Small Business Administration.Democrats focused their fire on Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Price.\u201cMr. Mnuchin profited off of kicking people out of their homes and then gave false testimony about his bank\u2019s abusive practices,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Democrats said Mr. Price had misled the committee about his investment in a small Australian biotechnology company that could have benefited from legislation that he promoted. Mr. Price bought discounted shares in the company through a private placement after learning about the company from another congressman.\u201cI asked Congressman Price directly if he got an exclusive discount, and he said no,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cThe evidence tells a different story,\u201d Mr. Wyden added. \u201cIt looks more and more like Congressman Price got special access to a special deal.\u201dAt his confirmation hearing, Mr. Price said, \u201cEverything that I did was ethical, aboveboard, legal and transparent.\u201dDemocrats were equally opposed to Mr. Price\u2019s views on health policy. As a member of the House, he has led efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And as chairman of the Budget Committee, he has proposed major changes to slow the growth of Medicare and Medicaid, which provide coverage to more than 100 million Americans.At the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Democrats cited Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, as a reason to block Mr. Sessions\u2019s nomination. They said he was too close to Mr. Trump to be independent.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Ms. Yates had shown \u201cguts\u201d in refusing to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration.\u201cI have no confidence that Senator Sessions will do that,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said.She and other Democrats invoked images of Mr. Sessions standing side by side with Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign hat.Republicans showed no signs of breaking ranks as they defended Mr. Sessions, a friend to many of them, and they predicted that he would eventually be confirmed.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that \u201cthe fact that he\u2019s close to the president\u201d should not surprise anyone. \u201cIs this going to be the test for us all going forward?\u201d Mr. Graham asked.Yamiche Alcindor and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Will Listen to a Billionaire\u2019s Troubles?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWho doesn\u2019t want to be a billionaire? A millionaire, even? Think of all the troubles that would simply melt away.Of course, we know deep down that money won\u2019t solve all of life\u2019s problems. And billionaires, it seems, have problems, too. One difference is, no one is likely to feel sorry for them.\u201cWhen you have a billion dollars, of course you\u2019re happy about that,\u201d said Brad Klontz, a psychologist and certified financial planner who works with the uber-wealthy.As a society, he said, we believe the wealthy have no right to complain about their lives. \u201cWe have little patience for that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth is, the ultrarich suffer from the same existential angst as anyone else.\u201dThe difference between their angst and ours is that a billionaire can\u2019t indulge in the fantasy that money would make everything better. \u201cBillionaires can look behind the curtain and see the wizard doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Mr. Klontz said. \u201cMore money is not going to make them happy.\u201d\u201cAlthough they know money is not the key to happiness, they can\u2019t stop counting it,\u201d Mr. Klontz said. It\u2019s especially challenging for those who are self-made, as opposed to those who inherit a fortune. For self-made billionaires, he said, \u201cTheir entire self-image and all their self-esteem is wrapped up in the pursuit of money.\u201dBillionaires often feel isolated, Mr. Klontz said, and find it difficult to trust people or have authentic relationships that are not about money. On top of that, they have a hard time finding a sympathetic ear. \u201cThere is a sense they can\u2019t really tell anyone what they are dealing with, because no one wants to hear about their struggles,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a society, we don\u2019t have the head space to entertain the notion of a billionaire having a bad day.\u201dMr. Klontz\u2019s interest in helping billionaires and others in their income bracket comes from an unlikely place: his own low-income past. \u201cI came from generations of poverty,\u201d said Mr. Klontz, 46.\u201cI wanted to see how they and their families were able to pass down a way of thinking and behaving associated with financial success,\u201d he said of the very rich. \u201cMy goal was to identify how their psychologies differ to help people achieve their financial goals.\u201dThe association was created by financial and mental health professionals who recognized that each group could benefit from the other\u2019s skill set. The association\u2019s members are trying to figure out how to combine those skill sets \u2014 financial and mental health \u2014 while protecting consumers. \u201cLike any other blossoming discipline, there is a lot of groundwork that needs to be done,\u201d Ms. Ford said.Becoming a counselor for the ultrarich was a long journey for Mr. Klontz, who grew up outside Detroit. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his mother, a part-time kindergarten teacher pregnant with his sister at the time, was granted full custody. Although she remarried a few years later to a high school teacher, their economic situation barely improved. Mr. Klontz said they went from being under \u201ctremendous financial strain\u201d to straddling the lower- to middle-class line during the rest of his childhood.Despite earning a doctorate in psychology, he remained financially strapped, graduating with $100,000 in accumulated student loan debt and a lot of anxiety about it.But it was 1999, and many of his friends were making lots of money trading stocks. \u201cI thought: This is what rich people do, so I\u2019ll do this, too,\u201d he said. Mr. Klontz sold his truck for about $7,000, bought a $450 car and threw everything that was left into tech stocks. \u201cIn three months the bubble burst and I lost everything I invested.\u201dRather than blame the market, Mr. Klontz decided to figure out what had caused his behavior. \u201cI went home and interviewed several of my family members about their relationship with money,\u201d he said. \u201cI found stories that blew my mind. But the one that is most salient, is that my grandfather lost all the family\u2019s money in the Great Depression and after that, never put a dollar in a bank again, not for the rest of his life. He died in his 90s, living in a trailer park.\u201dMr. Klontz became interested in learning more about his family\u2019s enormous anxiety around money. His mother, for example, had so much anxiety around it that she put every cent she saved into low-interest-bearing certificates of deposit, rather than the stock market. \u201cI saw these patterns around money in families that I call dysfunctional pendulum swing: You either do exactly what your parents did or the exact opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did: I did the riskiest thing you could do.\u201dAfter his stock market gamble, it took him three years of living extremely close to the bone to pull himself out of debt. The desire to understand the financial beliefs and behaviors of his own, lower-income family led him to dissect the behaviors and beliefs of high-net-worth individuals. And now he works with some of the wealthiest people in the world, many of whom came to him after reading his books or being referred by other clients.Mr. Klontz and his father also repaired their relationship.When Mr. Klontz was 19, his father bought Onsite Workshops, a treatment center in South Dakota, and Mr. Klontz lived with him while getting his master\u2019s degree in counseling; he also worked in his father\u2019s treatment program.And now, after all these years, what, if anything, does Mr. Klontz think psychologically separates the super rich from everyone else \u2014 understanding, of course, that generalizations by nature don\u2019t give a full picture.\u201cIn many ways, I would say they are just like you and I, if we had a billion dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent problems, but not a lack of problems.\u201cThey often have a distorted feedback loop. People are drawn to them for their status and perceived power, so they tend to be surrounded by people who endorse their worldview and don\u2019t challenge their way of thinking. Very few people are honest with them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Chief Taps Into the \u2018Right Now\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were undergraduates at Stanford University, they made an unconventional observation about what makes a social network valuable.Thanks to the rise of Facebook, most everyone believed that networks became exponentially more valuable by amassing more users. But Mr. Spiegel noticed that in real life, even people with thousands of acquaintances spent most of their time with just a few friends whose value outweighed a large number of looser ties.While online identity previously emphasized everything anyone has ever done, with Snapchat \u201cmy identity is who I am right now,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said in a 2015 video to describe the app.Along with financial information, Mr. Spiegel is expected to include remarks about Snap\u2019s mission that will showcase his zag-while-zigging philosophy.\u201cIf you want to understand Snap, look at Evan Spiegel,\u201d said Todd Chaffee, a partner at IVP, one of Snap\u2019s three largest venture capital investors. \u201cHe is the visionary who drives that company.\u201dMary Ritti, a spokeswoman for Snap, declined to comment for this story.Mr. Spiegel grew up in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy Los Angeles suburb, and attended Crossroads, a prep school in Santa Monica that counts Jonah Hill, Kate Hudson and Jack Black as alumni.He lived a privileged life, with expensive cars, exclusive club memberships and fancy vacations, according to records from his parents\u2019 divorce proceedings. His father, John Spiegel, a securities lawyer who helped overhaul the Los Angeles Police Department after the Rodney King beating in 1991, also had his children volunteer and build homes in poor areas of Mexico.While many techies talk about how the industry is a meritocracy, Mr. Spiegel has not shied from his wealthy roots. In public comments, he has said he is \u201ca young, white, educated male who got really, really lucky. And life isn\u2019t fair.\u201dAt Stanford, also his father\u2019s alma mater, Mr. Spiegel majored in product design and started a handful of companies with Mr. Murphy, a fellow Kappa Sigma fraternity brother. (Their early start-ups flopped.) There, Mr. Spiegel also met some of the men who would become his mentors, including Scott Cook, then the chief executive of Intuit, and Eric Schmidt, the Google chairman, who taught an M.B.A. class that he attended.Mr. Spiegel \u201creally is the next Gates or Zuckerberg,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said in an interview, comparing the Snap chief to Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, Bill Gates, and Facebook\u2019s chief, Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cHe has superb manners, which he says he got from his mother. He credits his father\u2019s long legal calls, which he overheard, to giving him perspective on business and structure as a very young man.\u201dWhen Snapchat started taking off, Mr. Spiegel did not wait to graduate from Stanford. He moved the company to the Venice Beach boardwalk, away from what he perceived as Silicon Valley\u2019s too-narrow focus on technology.When Mr. Spiegel met Institutional Venture Partners to discuss possible fund-raising, for example, he told IVP\u2019s partner, Dennis Phelps, that he was unwilling to accept the firm\u2019s standard investment terms.\u201cHe\u2019s different from most tech people because he knows what\u2019s cool and what\u2019s next,\u201d said Ryan Wilson, an artist in Los Angeles who goes by the name ThankYouX. He worked with Mr. Spiegel on a piece of art for one of Snapchat\u2019s offices. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like things because a dealer says he should. He just likes what he likes, whether it\u2019s made by a high school friend or a famous artist.\u201dMr. Spiegel has also involved himself in some political conversations. In 2015, he met with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, as a member of the 21st Century Council at the Berggruen Institute. Its founder, Nicolas Berggruen, said he impressed a group that includes Mohamed El-Erian, the economist, and former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with his \u201cthoughtful and mature approach to people.\u201d Last fall, Mr. Spiegel also attended a private dinner with John O. Brennan, then the director of the C.I.A. According to multiple attendees, Mr. Spiegel listened more than he spoke and had the ear of Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles.Mr. Spiegel\u2019s unconventional streak may be most evident in how he has steered Snap. He has long said that a public offering was what was best for the company and its investors, even as other tech start-ups chose to stay private as long as possible.Since Snapchat\u2019s debut, the app and the company have also undergone dozens of changes that were criticized for being too different from other consumer internet companies.Mr. Spiegel rejected the idea of a newsfeed in Snapchat\u2019s app, for example, because he said people prefer stories chronologically. In Facebook\u2019s News Feed, posts are reverse chronological, meaning the newest posts are at the top.Unlike other social networks, Snapchat also does not use algorithms to push people to see certain content. Snapchat users swipe their screens to navigate and view video vertically, rather than tap on menus or turn their phones to watch videos horizontally.\u201cFrom what I can figure out, he thinks differently about the way to monetize and develop a social network,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said of Mr. Spiegel.Investors who buy into Snap\u2019s initial public offering will soon be getting a piece of that approach.Allowing \u201courselves to be pulled in another direction\u201d is what makes us human, Mr. Spiegel said in a commencement speech at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business in 2015. Quoting John F. Kennedy, he added, \u201cConformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spanish Court Orders Criminal Inquiry Into Oversight of Bankia I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s national court on Monday ordered a criminal inquiry into whether a former governor of the country\u2019s central bank and seven other regulatory officials knowingly ignored financial problems at Bankia, the giant savings bank whose near collapse prompted Spain\u2019s banking bailout in 2012.The court said in a statement that there was sufficient evidence to indict the officials in connection with Bankia\u2019s initial public offering in 2011, a year before the bank\u2019s forced nationalization.Top officials gave the listing regulatory clearance, the court said, \u201cdespite having full and thorough knowledge of the situation in which the entity found itself.\u201d The court did not specify any possible charges but cited internal emails in which inspectors warned of the risks linked to Bankia\u2019s finances. The warnings went unheeded by the inspectors\u2019 superiors.After the court\u2019s announcement, the Bank of Spain, the central bank, said three of the eight officials in question would resign, all of them senior officials in charge of the bank\u2019s supervision and inspection activities.The case could be the first instance in which the apex of Spain\u2019s financial regulatory system is held directly accountable for its failure to prevent the Bankia scandal, in particular the initial public offering, in which shareholders were wiped out.While Bankia and smaller banks collapsed as a result of mortgage loan defaults tied to the bursting of Spain\u2019s construction bubble in 2008, their demise also highlighted inefficiencies and conflicts of interest in a sector where politicians often sat on caja boards.Bankia is already the subject of several court cases, including a trial over whether the former management, led by Rodrigo Rato, failed to accurately disclose the status of Bankia\u2019s accounts before the public offering. Before becoming chairman of Bankia, Mr. Rato was Spain\u2019s finance minister and also served as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Mr. Rato and other former Bankia directors are also facing trial on accusations they used corporate credit cards for personal purchases. Mr. Rato and the others deny wrongdoing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subway\u2019s Slide in Performance Leaves Straphangers Fuming", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySubway riders in New York City have become increasingly angry about the quality of service. Their fury is justified.After a long period of improvement, the system\u2019s reliability has dropped significantly, with delays more than doubling over the last five years, according to a review of data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Subway delays have jumped to more than 70,000 each month, from about 28,000 per month in 2012, according to the data. On some lines, trains arrive late to their final destination well over half the time.Adding to the misery is worsening mechanical performance \u2014 a troubling sign that the train fleet is not being adequately replaced or maintained and a problem that has contributed to the spike in delays. The average distance that subway cars travel between breakdowns was about 120,000 miles in November, down from 200,000 in November 2010.The decline in service is frustrating many passengers as they stew on stalled trains, pressing uncomfortably close to other riders and worrying about being late to work. When an overstuffed train arrives, commuters must decide whether to squeeze aboard or wait for another, however long that takes.Erin Buckley was caught in one of the delays this month when her F train stopped abruptly in Manhattan. A mechanical problem left her stuck on board for more than half an hour.\u201cThe last few months have been maddening,\u201d said Ms. Buckley, 27, who lives in Brooklyn.Transit advocates are pressing Mr. Cuomo to expend the same level of urgency on improving service across the system.\u201cIf the governor is going to take credit for opening the Second Avenue subway on time, he has to take responsibility for all of the things that are not working on the subway,\u201d said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.\u201cAnyone who claims this governor hasn\u2019t been focused on improving the M.T.A. simply isn\u2019t paying attention or doesn\u2019t understand how long these challenges went unaddressed,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said in a statement.Still, only 67 percent of subway trains reach their final station within five minutes of the transportation authority\u2019s schedule on weekdays \u2014 a drop of about 15 percentage points since 2012. Some lines, like the No. 2 and No. 5, have particularly dismal on-time rates of less than 40 percent.\u201cThere is not one single panacea that\u2019s going to solve this,\u201d Ms. Hakim said in an interview. \u201cThis is about tackling many fronts.\u201dMs. Hakim said the reliability of trains, known as mean distance between failure, had dropped because it had reached an artificially high level when a large order of new subway cars arrived in 2010. The figures will improve, she said, when a batch of new cars begins to arrive this year.\u201cWe haven\u2019t cut back on maintenance,\u201d Ms. Hakim said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with an aging fleet.\u201dNew York\u2019s subway is also one of the few systems in the world that run 24 hours a day, adding to wear and tear and leaving few windows for workers to perform maintenance on the tracks.\u201cIf you do the scheduled overhaul of a car fleet on a regular basis, you shouldn\u2019t get a rapid decline in the reliability,\u201d Mr. Gunn said.The reliability of the subway\u2019s 6,400 cars varies by model. The oldest R32 cars, which arrived in the 1960s, travel only about 32,000 miles between failures. Those cars should have been replaced by now, but an order of 300 new cars was delayed by more than a year because of problems with the manufacturer, Bombardier.For New Yorkers, the subway disruptions have painful consequences. On a recent morning, a delay on the C train caused Taylor Gordon to be a half-hour late to a job interview at a fast-food restaurant.\u201cI feel like we spend so much money on subway service,\u201d he said, \u201cand the service has not gotten any better.\u201dVeronica Rodriguez, also of Brooklyn, said she welcomed the demise of the C line\u2019s screeching 1960s-era cars. She said she wished the authority would improve the signals to streamline train traffic.\u201cSince they just opened up the Second Avenue subway, maybe they could get some funding over here on the C train,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said.When Jenny Cheng is in a rush, she hails an Uber car instead of riding the subway. A car pool trip from her home on the Upper West Side to work costs about $5.\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have to wait,\u201d she said, \u201cso I just Uber, and it\u2019s much faster.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Score One for the Bank Whistle-Blowers", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameHere is something to celebrate: The United States Supreme Court just handed whistle-blowers one of their bigger wins in a long time.People who expose wrongdoing in the workplace or among government contractors have taken a beating in recent years. The Obama Administration was especially assiduous in its pursuit of whistle-blowers, and President Trump has also singled them out for scorn.By highlighting a more expansive standard for what constitutes a false claim under the act, the court\u2019s ruling is likely to open the door to more whistle-blower cases, according to lawyers who represent plaintiffs in these matters.Because whistle-blowers help make the world a better place, that is a good thing.But there is something else to like about the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. This particular case involved actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators to shore up failing banks during the financial crisis. As the matter continues through the courts, it may shed new light on the details of these regulatory activities, including the entities that benefited and at what cost to taxpayers.The case at the heart of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was brought by two former bank employees who alleged that fraud was occurring at their institutions, Wachovia and World Savings Bank. Both companies became part of Wells Fargo during the mortgage crisis in 2008, so Wells Fargo is the defendant in the case.Mary Eshet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement: \u201cWe continue to believe these claims are without merit, as the previous court decisions have confirmed. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case again.\u201dThe former employees, Paul Bishop from World Savings and Robert Kraus from Wachovia, filed the suit in 2011 under the False Claims Act; they seek damages from Wells Fargo on behalf of taxpayers for improprieties that occurred before and during the mortgage crisis.Both men were fired after they told their superiors about the frauds. Mr. Bishop was a residential mortgage sales representative at World Savings, while Mr. Kraus was vice president and controller for the Real Estate Capital Markets group and the Corporate and Investment Bank Finance group at Wachovia. His expertise was in commercial real estate lending.According to the lawsuit, the fraud identified by Mr. Kraus involved accounting maneuvers using an off-balance sheet entity that made Wachovia\u2019s books look better than they were. Insiders at the bank had a name for the entity: the Black Box.If Wachovia wanted to hide certain loans from internal or regulatory review, bank officials would temporarily move them to the Black Box, Mr. Kraus contended. This was problematic because accounting rules stated that off-balance sheet vehicles must be \u201cdemonstrably distinct\u201d from the entities transferring loans to them. The Black Box was not, so the loans in it should have been consolidated onto the Wachovia balance sheet.How big was the Black Box? As of Aug. 1, 2005, it contained some $6 billion in loans and other assets, the lawsuit said. That amounted to almost 13 percent of Wachovia\u2019s equity capital at the time.The plaintiffs contended that the use of the Black Box obscured risks at the bank and violated Sarbanes-Oxley, the Enron-era law that required executives to certify the accuracy of their companies\u2019 financial reports. The Black Box kept billions of dollars in commercial real estate loans \u201coutside the prying and meddling eyes of its regulators, shareholders, and risk management, internal control and accounting personnel,\u201d the lawsuit said.Even more troubling, the Black Box deceived federal regulators about the state of Wachovia\u2019s financial health, the lawsuit said. And in 2007 and 2008, when the bank received financial support from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other federal entities in response to the growing mortgage crisis, those payments were provided under false pretenses, the plaintiffs contended.The plaintiffs contend that taxpayers are owed damages reflecting the difference between what the banks paid for the billions of dollars in financial assistance and what they would have paid for that help if they had been truthful about their precarious financial position. If the former employees win their case, they will receive a portion of those damages.Improper mortgage practices at World Savings, according to Mr. Bishop, also contributed to the deception of the bank\u2019s regulators. Residential mortgages were made to borrowers without adequate disclosure of risks, he said, a problem he grew concerned about a few years after he joined the bank in 2002.In May 2006, after Wachovia announced its purchase of World Savings, Mr. Bishop asked his superiors to warn Wachovia that it was buying a portfolio of \u201ctoxic\u201d loans, the complaint stated. He was fired days later.For both of the plaintiffs, the case has provided a wrenching education about what happens to those who speak truth to power.Mr. Kraus, for example, has been unable to find work as a finance executive even with his deep experience and a master\u2019s degree from New York University. He currently works at a McDonald\u2019s in North Carolina and narrowly avoided losing his home to foreclosure.\u201cWhen you blow the whistle, you better be clear that you are on your own,\u201d said Mr. Bishop, who is 69. \u201cI na\u00efvely believed there was a system behind me that would enforce the rules.\u201dAfter a long career in sales, Mr. Bishop has been able to find work more easily, he said. In 2009, he appeared on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d recounting what he saw at World Savings. During the aftermath of the financial crisis, he provided testimony on behalf of troubled borrowers helping save their homes from foreclosure. He said he testified in some 50 cases as an expert.Today, Mr. Bishop has an insurance business. But he is also helping lower-level Wells Fargo employees who have been fired amid the recent phony accounts scandal.Being a whistle-blower has been trying, Mr. Bishop said. Though the case is far from over, the recent Supreme Court ruling has proved something meaningful to him: Individuals can take on a powerful institution and \u2014 potentially \u2014 win.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Conservatives Seek a Champion, and Redemption", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Canada\u2019s Conservatives need a way back.In many other Western democracies \u2014 including the big one just to the south \u2014 the political right has been on the rise lately, rallying behind leaders who tap into voters\u2019 anger, frustration and fears. But Canada\u2019s Conservatives are in the political wilderness, still smarting from their defeat by Justin Trudeau and his Liberals in October 2015, and lacking a permanent leader to replace Stephen Harper, the former prime minister, who quickly dropped from sight after the election.So the Tories are asking: Who can take up our standard, cross swords with a charismatic and popular opponent, and lead us back to power in Parliament?It will not be Rona Ambrose, the interim leader since Mr. Harper left. Though she is generally seen as having done a good job under the circumstances, party rules bar her from running for the permanent post.Whoever prevails also becomes the leader of the official opposition in Parliament \u2014 and, if the Tories can win the most seats in the House of Commons, would become the next prime minister. The next general election is expected in 2019.The leadership vote will not be conducted like an American primary. Only dues-paying Conservatives enrolled before March 28 will be eligible to cast ballots \u2014 the current figure is just over 100,000 people, out of Canada\u2019s 26 million voters. And the complexities of the voting system make it hard to say who might be leading the pack.For one thing, voters do not choose just one candidate; they rank several in order of preference. Then the ballots from each of the country\u2019s 338 electoral districts are tabulated separately, and the district results are translated into a point system. The points are added up nationally again and again, with the trailing candidates dropped one at a time and their points reallocated until someone secures a majority.The system is meant to ensure that the winner has broad support across the country and not in just one region \u2014 but it can also deliver victory to a candidate who does not draw the most first-choice votes but is a popular second or third choice.The contest is covered by Canada\u2019s federal election spending laws, which tightly restrict both donations and self-financing by the candidates. That, too, makes the race harder to handicap.Even so, a few candidates have attracted more attention than the rest, which may be a rough reflection of their support. Here are sketches of four of the most prominent contenders.Ms. Leitch, who was a cabinet minister in the Harper government, has cast herself as a populist, pushing immigration policies that are the opposite of those of Mr. Trudeau. In particular, Ms. Leitch wants all immigrants to be screened for \u201cCanadian values,\u201d to maintain \u201ca unified Canadian identity\u201d; her list of those values includes hard work, equal opportunity, help for others, generosity, freedom and tolerance.Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s policy platform so far is thin, based largely on his view that Canada under Mr. Trudeau is bound for economic ruin and that his business background would help the Conservatives campaign successfully on economic issues. Like many of his rivals, he calls for lower taxes and an end to Canada\u2019s carbon-pricing program.Several factors may offset Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s celebrity. He spends almost as much time in Boston as in Canada. In the past, he has been dismissive of Conservative lawmakers, who are now important influences in the race. And his ability to speak French, Canada\u2019s other official language, is weak; it was widely noted that he did not join the race until after the only scheduled French-language debate.When Mr. Chong was a minister in Mr. Harper\u2019s government, he did something very unusual: He quit. He and others bristled at the tight leash Mr. Harper kept on his cabinet, but a government motion giving Quebec a form of nationhood within Canada was too much for Mr. Chong; he resigned rather than vote for the motion, as cabinet rules required.He put more distance between himself and Mr. Harper by persuading Parliament in 2013 to pass a bill giving members some independent powers. The changes were modest, but it is very unusual in Canada for any bill introduced by an individual legislator, rather than the government, to become law.Mr. Chong, the son of immigrants from Hong Kong and the Netherlands, could help the Tories appeal to foreign-born Canadians, a significant constituency. At 45, he is one month older than Mr. Trudeau and shares some of the prime minister\u2019s youthful political style.Mr. Chong is an outlier in the race on some major policy questions, like carbon pricing: He wants to increase carbon taxes and use the proceeds to reduce income taxes. That might play well in Ontario, where Mr. Chong lives, but would be a hard sell to the Conservative base in western Canada.Politicians in Quebec generally have a social democratic bent, but not Mr. Bernier, who describes himself as a libertarian. In Parliament, he represents the Beauce region of the largely French-speaking province, an area some Quebecers compare to Texas because of its conservatism.Advertisement"}

Retirees, Suit Claims", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, have sued a New Jersey-based finance company, accusing it of deceiving retired N.F.L. football players who hoped to receive money in the league\u2019s landmark concussion settlement.The suit, filed Tuesday in United States District Court in Manhattan, alleges that RD Legal Funding L.L.C. and Roni Dersovitz, the company\u2019s founder, lent money to N.F.L. retirees at high interest rates that was to be repaid with settlement money they may receive from the N.F.L. The league has agreed to pay up to $5 million to former players with diagnoses of severe neurological disorders. The company is accused of \u201cluring them into costly advances on settlement payouts with lies about the terms of the deals,\u201d the suit said.RD Legal Funding, the suit said, also took advantage of Sept. 11 emergency medical workers who have cancer and other illnesses.\u201cWe allege that this company and its owner lined their pockets with funds intended to cover medical care and other critical expenses for people who are sick and sidelined,\u201d Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, said in a statement.David Willingham, a lawyer representing RD Legal Funding, which is based in Cresskill, N.J., called the allegations against his client \u201coutrageous and without merit.\u201d The claims, he said, \u201cmisunderstand and falsely characterize clear documents with those parties as \u2018loans\u2019 and falsely state that RDLF is \u2018scamming\u2019 the affected parties when it did nothing more than provide immediate liquidity\u201d to people who voluntarily sought loans.RD Legal is one of a handful of lenders who provide advances to people awaiting payouts from settlements in class-action suits and other instances. The loans often come with interest rates of 40 percent or higher and are repaid with the money received in the settlements.This type of lending against a settlement payout is part of a legal but largely unregulated business focused mostly on victims in personal injury cases. The loans, though, have potentially devastating trapdoors, most notably the high interest rates that kick in immediately after money is advanced, and can cut deeply into the sum a player might ultimately receive in a settlement.Some financial watchdogs accuse the lenders of preying on people who are sick or who, in the case of the N.F.L. retirees, have memory problems or other cognitive ailments that could mean they cannot fully grasp the terms of the loans, which often require the players\u2019 lawyers to provide consent.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about injured players being victimized again by unscrupulous money lenders posing as concerned friends,\u201d said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer and a former chairman of the New York State Traumatic Brain Injury Services Coordinating Council. \u201cProtections need to be put in place by their attorneys, who purportedly are representing their interests.\u201dIn January, RD Legal Funding sued the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and the New York attorney general \u201cfor engaging in an inappropriate overreach of their legal authority.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Party line votes in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Budget Committee also advanced the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be the White House budget director, despite deep concerns among Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 over his tightfisted spending record.Senators on Thursday teed up what could be a week of rapid-fire confirmations, taking procedural votes to move forward with the nominations of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be attorney general, Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be secretary of health and human services, and Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary.Those confirmation votes are expected to come early next week, after a white-knuckled vote on the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be education secretary. With two Republican senators opposing Ms. DeVos, her confirmation hangs by a single vote. In a procedural quirk, Mr. Sessions\u2019s confirmation vote is scheduled after that of Ms. DeVos so he can vote \u201cyes\u201d before he leaves the Senate.Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Pruitt also appeared headed for confirmation next week.Donald Trump and his cabinet have sent mixed signals on some big environmental decisions they face. Take this quiz and see where the different possible choices lead.A day after Democrats on the Senate environment committee boycotted a planned vote on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s nomination, the panel\u2019s Republicans reconvened on Thursday and temporarily suspended the committee\u2019s rules, which require the presence of at least two Democrats to hold votes, and approved Mr. Pruitt.\u201cWe took this extraordinary step because the minority took the extraordinary step of boycotting the meeting,\u201d said the environment committee\u2019s chairman, Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.\u201cThe minority has put us in these uncharted waters,\u201d he said. \u201cNever before in the history of E.P.A. has a nominee for E.P.A. been boycotted.\u201d\u201cPruitt\u2019s record gives us no reason to believe that he will vigorously hold polluters accountable or enforce the law,\u201d said Ken Kimmell, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science-based nonprofit group. \u201cPruitt may not have answered senators\u2019 questions, but everything we do know makes it clear that he can\u2019t and won\u2019t do the job.\u201dIn boycotting Mr. Pruitt\u2019s confirmation proceeding, Democrats complained that he had failed to adequately answer their questions and address their concerns about how he would run the agency charged with protecting the nation\u2019s air, water and public health.\u201cThe committee Democrats are deeply concerned about the lack of thoroughness of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s responses to our questions for the record,\u201d wrote Senator Thomas R.

He should know because it is his job to pick up after them.As a New York City sanitation worker, he drives a mechanical street sweeper past a small forest of new residential buildings, crowded subway stations and block after block of stores, restaurants and bars. He finds so many more water bottles, soiled napkins, newspapers, cigarette butts and nastier discards than when he started nine years ago that he has to circle back and make a second pass.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more litter for me to pick up,\u201d said Mr. Patton, 32. \u201cI can\u2019t slack off at all.\u201dEven the city\u2019s least populous borough, Staten Island, is confronting growing heaps of garbage. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had litter, but it\u2019s at a level that\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said James S. Oddo, the Staten Island borough president, who now keeps a private cleaning company on hand for emergency spot cleanings and is shopping for a \u201cmini-mechanical sweeper\u201d \u2014 a vacuum truck \u2014 to add to his arsenal.\u201cI\u2019m the only person who\u2019d like to see it rain on Sunday to see less traffic,\u201d said Kathryn Garcia, the city\u2019s sanitation commissioner.It is not only sanitation workers who are busier. An \u201cadopt-a-basket\u201d program that recruits businesses and others to empty street baskets currently has 3,276 volunteers, up from 1,880 a year ago. Community organizations have sent out hundreds of cleaning crews to pick up litter as part of a city-financed program, NYC Cleanup, which has been expanded every year since the City Council started it in 2014.Times Square, which draws as many as 445,000 people daily, requires a full-time cleaning staff of 68, up from 41 in 2012, including one worker whose only job is picking up chewing gum, some 400 pieces a day, according to Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance. The organization has invested $1.5 million on 385 waste-compacting bins, which have made a dent in what Mr. Tompkins calls the \u201cMount Everest of trash bags.\u201dBut even with all the extra cleaning, trash continues to accumulate in corners of the city. In Lower Manhattan, trash bags are stacked up to 10 feet high in front of shiny new residential towers, blocking narrow sidewalks and attracting rats. Across the river in Brooklyn, enough residents have complained about garbage that a local councilman, Stephen Levin, is organizing a town hall meeting.In the South Bronx, Councilman Rafael Salamanca Jr. said he sees overwhelmed trash baskets every day. \u201cI\u2019m here advocating that the South Bronx is changing, and we\u2019re moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then across the street from my office, you have an overflowing garbage can. It just gets under my skin.\u201dNew York City\u2019s trash problems go back to its early days as a Dutch settlement, said Robin Nagle, an anthropology professor at New York University and the author of \u201cPicking Up: On the Streets and Behind the Trucks with the Sanitation Workers of New York City.\u201d In 1657, Peter Stuyvesant decreed that residents could only dispose of trash in five designated spots along the East River in an attempt to clean filthy streets. \u201cIt was ignored, pretty much,\u201d Ms. Nagle said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been the challenge.\u201dThen as now, trash can take on a life of its own. In the same way that a few broken windows in a community can encourage more crime \u2014 the \u201cbroken windows theory\u201d \u2014 even a small amount of trash on the streets can attract more trash, Ms. Nagle said. \u201cIt\u2019s like an invitation to add more litter,\u201d she said.In Flushing, a neighborhood in Queens that has seen a huge influx of new residents and visitors, a pedestrian triangle became known as \u201ctrash triangle\u201d after someone tossed trash bags there and other residents followed, according to a councilman, Peter Koo, who has pushed to get it cleaned up. Another magnet for trash has been a densely packed stretch of 40th Road, where there is an entrance for the Long Island Rail Road, along with restaurants, stores and a playground.City sanitation officials do not track the volume of litter and debris collected by mechanical street sweepers, or emptied from street baskets in specific neighborhoods. The department\u2019s total trash collection, which includes pickups from residential buildings, has declined to 3.2 million tons in 2016 from 3.5 million tons the decade before, in part as recycling and composting have increased and manufacturers have used less packaging, Ms. Garcia, the sanitation commissioner, said.A major headache for sanitation workers, she added, has been trying to clean around the increasing number of cars that flout street cleaning rules. The department issued 263,421 violations to drivers for failing to move their cars in 2016, up from 218,976 in 2010.Sitting behind the wheel of a street sweeper on a recent morning, Mr. Patton was forced to zigzag around parked cars as other drivers sped by him. As he crawled up to a crowded intersection at 10 miles per hour, he braked for a woman on a cellphone who darted in front of him. \u201cEven though I\u2019m loud, it seems like they don\u2019t notice me,\u201d he said.In Williamsburg and other neighborhoods, residents say that many newcomers put out their household trash bags at the wrong times, sometimes cluttering curbs for days. Some also fail to securely tie the trash or use flimsy plastic bags that break open, contributing to street litter.Homer Hill, a spokesman for the Grand Street Business Improvement District, which maintains six blocks in Williamsburg with 200 buildings, said his group has stepped up efforts to work with residents and new property owners to teach collection schedules, especially in smaller buildings where there is no full-time superintendent. The district also employs a seven-day-a-week cleaner to tidy up the streets.In many cases, combating growing litter piles has required some creativity. The Parks Department is testing a new trash management program at Crotona Park in the Bronx, in which trash and recycling baskets are strategically placed in high-traffic areas and weighed down with concrete so they cannot be blown away or moved by park users.NYC Cleanup doubles as a job training program, with community organizations employing people on cleaning crews who have been homeless or in prison. One of the City Council\u2019s most popular initiatives, it received $7.8 million in funding last year, up from $3.5 million in 2014.David Greenfield, a Brooklyn councilman, said he proposed the program because he could not walk down the street without stepping over pizza boxes and coffee cups.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have more people, you\u2019re going to have more trash,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a common sense way to deal with a nuisance that was frustrating many New Yorkers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "D.N.C. Contenders Agree on One Thing: Resistance to Trump", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBALTIMORE \u2014 The outpouring of protests across the country has scrambled the contest for chairman of the Democratic National Committee two weeks before the vote, as party activists thrash out who should be the face of a newly energized party.The surge of liberal activism in response to President Trump\u2019s election has transcended the divisions that some Democrats feared would cleave the party after its defeat in November. But it has also injected volatility into a race for party chairman that had been shaping up as a straightforward proxy war between the candidates most closely identified with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Hillary Clinton.Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s most prominent surrogates during last year\u2019s primary race, and Thomas E. Perez, the former labor secretary who backed Mrs. Clinton and received consideration to be her running mate, have emerged as the leading contenders. Yet neither has secured the support of anywhere close to a majority of the 447 committee members who will decide the race, as other candidates did in the weeks leading up to prior votes.This is partly because other hopefuls in a field that has swelled to double digits have yet to withdraw from the race. But it also owes to the genuine uncertainty about who can best harness the antipathy toward Mr. Trump, and lead a party that has been dominated by former President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton for more than two decades.At the final party-sponsored candidate forum here on Saturday, the leading candidates all sought to associate themselves with the \u201cresistance\u201d against Mr. Trump. In an acknowledgment of how much Democrats are enjoying their Trump-inspired unity \u2014 and how much they do not want a replay of the Clinton-Sanders race \u2014 Mr. Perez and Mr. Ellison held to a de facto nonaggression pact toward each another.\u201cI had no better friend,\u201d Mr. Ellison said of Mr. Perez, referring to the former secretary\u2019s time in the Obama cabinet.Strikingly, only one candidate among the 10 onstage truly confronted the two front-runners: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.\u201cWhy not go with somebody who isn\u2019t a product of one faction or another faction, but somebody who is here to deliver the fresh start our party needs,\u201d said Mr. Buttigieg, adding of the party\u2019s contentious presidential primary, \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019d want to live through it a second time.\u201dHe does not have anywhere near the number of public commitments that Mr. Ellison and Mr. Perez currently enjoy, but Mr. Buttigieg is trying to fashion himself as a compromise candidate if neither of the front-runners secure a majority on the first ballot when the party gathers this month in Atlanta.Anticipating such an effort, two of the other trailing contenders used the forum to target Mr. Buttigieg. The New Hampshire Democratic chairman, Raymond Buckley, boasting of his own neutrality during the presidential primary, turned to Mr. Buttigieg at one point and reminded him of his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cSorry, mayor who supported Hillary,\u201d Mr. Buckley quipped. And Jehmu Greene, a Democratic organizer and a former Fox News contributor, chided the 35-year-old Mr. Buttigieg for his frequent remark that a millennial is best suited to represent millennials.Before and after the gathering, rumors of deals being struck between competing camps swirled in the corridors of this city\u2019s convention center, where the contenders set up booths and one candidate seeking to become the party finance chairman even sprang for a platter of crab cakes.While the hopefuls for party chairman have slightly divergent diagnoses of what went wrong last year and ideas for the best way forward, the discussion so far has largely centered on party tactics and strategy. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory in the popular vote, Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity and the increasingly liberal bent of the party\u2019s grass roots have tempered any calls for moderation.\u201cThis is not going to be a philosophical battle,\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the second-ranking House Democrat. Mr. Hoyer was at Saturday\u2019s forum to support Mr. Perez, but called both his candidate and Mr. Ellison \u201cstrong progressives.\u201dWith support from a number of governors, leading donors and Obama loyalists, Mr. Perez is clearly the preferred candidate among the Democratic establishment. That status, despite his liberal credentials, has made him a figure of suspicion among elements of the Sanders-inspired left.\u201cIt says a lot about how much Sanders has skewed how Democrats think when the Latino labor activist from Takoma Park is considered the centrist,\u201d said Kenneth Baer, an author and a former Obama administration official, alluding to the progressive Maryland enclave where Mr. Perez lives.At the outset of the forum here, Mr. Perez proclaimed, \u201cI miss Barack Obama a lot, my friends.\u201d Yet he conceded during a television interview that the former president had not paid sufficient attention to party-building.The machinations have seemed rather small, though, in light of the boiling fury toward Mr. Trump.Ben Jealous, the former N.A.A.C.P. president and a supporter of Mr. Ellison, noted that the Sanders-affiliated progressive group that he helps lead had drawn 500 participants to a rally on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and another 400 to Western Maryland, both conservative parts of the state.\u201cDonald Trump will ensure we stay woke,\u201d Mr. Jealous said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Has the Art Market Become an Unwitting Partner in Crime?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you sell your home the paperwork details the sale, including your name, and the title search lists the names of the people who owned the property before you. But when someone sells an artwork at auction \u2014 even something worth $100 million, much more than your house \u2014 the identity is typically concealed.Oh, the paperwork might identify the work as coming from \u201ca European collection.\u201d But the buyer usually has no clue with whom he or she is really dealing. Sometimes, surprisingly, even the auction house may not know who the seller is.Secrecy has long been central to the art world. Anonymity protects privacy, adds mystique and cuts the taint of crass commerce from such transactions. But some experts are now saying this sort of discretion \u2014 one founded in a simpler time, when only a few wealthy collectors took part in the art market \u2014 is not only quaint but also reckless when art is traded like a commodity and increasingly suspected in money laundering.\u201cThe art market is an ideal playing ground for money laundering,\u201d said Thomas Christ, a board member of the Basel Institute on Governance, a Swiss nonprofit that has studied the issue. \u201cWe have to ask for clear transparency, where you got the money from and where it is going.\u201d\u201cWhere it has concerns, Christie\u2019s declines the transaction,\u201d the company said in a statement.Another recent dispute seems to reveal that auction houses themselves do not always know whose art they are selling. In this instance a collector has accused Sotheby\u2019s of selling his $16 million painting by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec without knowing who actually owned it.The Toulouse-Lautrec work, \u201cAu Lit: Le Baiser,\u201d consigned for sale at Sotheby\u2019s in London in 2015, depicts two women embracing on a bed. The Swiss dealer who brought the work to Sotheby\u2019s, Yves Bouvier, signed the standard paperwork surrounding such a sale, which requires the consignor to indicate he or she either owns the painting or is authorized to sell it. After the sale, he was given the proceeds.\u201cIt is extraordinary that such a rare and high-value work could have been sold at auction without the auction house knowing the identity of the true owner,\u201d Tetiana Bersheda, a lawyer for the Rybolovlev family office, said in a statement.Actually, experts said, it\u2019s not that rare. \u201cDo auction houses know who the principal is?\u201d asked Amelia K. Brankov, a lawyer who specializes in the art market. \u201cI don\u2019t think they always do.\u201dMr. Rybolovlev, who himself has used offshore shell companies that obscured his ownership of art, is now engaged in a sprawling legal battle in several courts with Mr. Bouvier, over matters that include the money from the Sotheby\u2019s sale.(Mr. Bouvier, who is also a leader in the international art storage business, said he has not turned over the money because, he said, Mr. Rybolovlev had told him to keep it to partially settle a debt from another transaction.)Sotheby\u2019s declined to comment on whether it believed Mr. Bouvier to be the owner. But it says it knew him very well as a customer and that he had represented to them that he had the legal right to sell the property. As to its policy of learning the identity of ultimate owners, Sotheby\u2019s said it takes a risk-based approach \u2014 sometimes requiring disclosure depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each situation.Auction houses live off the fees they earn for brokering sales, so it makes sense that auction houses would both value and trust customers who bring in a lot of business like Mr. Bouvier, who bought hundreds of millions of dollars of art at sales.Other valuable customers for the auction houses and dealers were Malaysian businessmen who, beginning in 2013, bought more than $200 million in art, usually operating as the Tanore Finance Corporation, including eight works at Christie\u2019s. The United States government contends in a civil complaint that the art was purchased with money that had been embezzled from Malaysian government accounts and that the ultimate beneficiary was Jho Low, one of the businessmen. Mr. Low, who has denied any wrongdoing, has not been criminally charged.Art was far from the only asset into which Mr. Low transferred funds, and the art world has pointed out that he passed muster with other entities such as banks and law firms before federal officials here last year identified him in its complaint.Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s said they each have long had rigorous programs to curb money laundering and that until the investigation became public, there had been no reason to suspect anything was amiss with Mr. Low.\u201cBefore extending a loan to Mr. Low, we conducted extensive due diligence in accordance with our Anti Money-Laundering and Know Your Client procedures,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement.Artworks are particularly suitable vehicles for money launderers, experts said, because they transfer easily and store quietly, perhaps in a basement or in an offshore tax haven. Unlike the real estate market, where lightning escalations in price are rare, values in art can be suddenly boosted by intangibles such as fads and personal taste.Beyond the question of money laundering, some experts say the anonymity of buyers and sellers hinders their ability to track ownership, a key element in establishing a work\u2019s authenticity.Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn, a New York gallerist and art adviser, said there are situations, as when a scholar is putting together an academic inventory of an artist\u2019s work, where collectors do acknowledge ownership. \u201cWe work with the collector,\u201d she said, \u2018Would you like to cooperate?\u2019 If they say no, we respect that.\u201dBut she said she would resist a more general turn away from secrecy. \u201cThe move toward transparency is always there, but a collector\u2019s private collection is their private collection,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is in their home. It is not in the public domain.\u201dRegulators in other financial sectors have been working to eliminate veils.But efforts to reduce anonymity in art sales have gone nowhere. In 2012, a New York appeals court ruled that auction houses did have to let buyers know the identity of sellers. But the decision was overturned on appeal.The auction houses and some experts say that money laundering is rare and the threat overstated.Sometimes, they said, the names of prior owners are carried in auction catalogs and even in situations where owners sell through an agent, the houses often know their identity because of their broad knowledge of the market.Many in the art world believe that eliminating anonymity would damage the market and invade privacy. Some sellers, they say, are families only looking to avoid the embarrassment of crushing debt. Others may be museums seeking to quietly deaccession works from their collection without causing a big fuss.Imposing rules on auction houses, some experts argue, would only push the business toward less regulated markets abroad or into the hands of private dealers \u2014 who are not required to announce sales or publish prices.\u201cWe have to tread lightly,\u201d said Evan Beard, who advises clients on art and finance at U.S. Trust, \u201cunless we start to see that art is being misused in various ways. You have got to do it without throwing too much sand in the gears.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joyous Africans Take to the Rails, With China\u2019s Help", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDJIBOUTI \u2014 The 10:24 a.m. train out of Djibouti\u2019s capital drew some of the biggest names in the Horn of Africa last month. Serenaded by a chorus of tribal singers, the crush of African leaders, European diplomats and pop icons climbed the stairs of the newly built train station and merrily jostled their way into the pristine, air-conditioned carriages making their inaugural run.\u201cIt is indeed a historic moment, a pride for our nations and peoples,\u201d said Hailemariam Desalegn, the prime minister of Ethiopia, shortly before the train \u2014 the first electric transnational railway in Africa \u2014 headed toward Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. \u201cThis line will change the social and economic landscape of our two countries.\u201dBut perhaps the biggest star of the day was China, which designed the system, supplied the trains and imported hundreds of engineers for the six years it took to plan and build the 466-mile line. And the $4 billion cost? Chinese banks provided nearly all the financing.But few places are being reshaped by China\u2019s overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century.Much of that spending has been directed at rail projects that planners hope will transform the way Africans travel and do business with one another, and the rest of the world.That worries some African officials and longtime experts, who fear the loss of American influence and largess \u2014 and the good will that is often produced by desperately needed infrastructure projects.Amadou Sy, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the United States was also missing opportunities to cultivate loyal customers.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for new markets, Africa is the place to be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, the U.S. is not leveraging Africa\u2019s huge potential. By contrast, the Chinese are there, and they are willing to take risks.\u201dChina is placing more than $14 billion worth of bets here in Djibouti, a geopolitically strategic speck of a country beset by soaring poverty and unemployment. The projects include three ports, two airports and a pipeline that will bring water from Ethiopia, its landlocked neighbor and a regional economic power that depends on Djibouti\u2019s ports for 90 percent of its foreign trade.Also on the drawing board are a series of Chinese-built, coal-fired power plants that would ease summertime electricity failures and help fuel a new tax-free manufacturing zone that officials hope will turn Djibouti into a Hong Kong-style entrep\u00f4t and international shipping hub.Aboubaker Omar Hadi, chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, said he hoped the new railway linking his country to the Ethiopian capital would be just the first leg of a long-dreamed trans-Africa route, from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.\u201cThe train is already a game-changer,\u201d he said, noting that it will cut to 12 hours what until now had been a grueling three- or four-day trip by truck.Mr. Hadi praised the Chinese for going all in after Western banks declined to help finance the nation\u2019s glaring infrastructure needs.\u201cWe approached the U.S., and they didn\u2019t have the vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not thinking ahead 30 years. They only have a vision of Africa from the past, as a continent of war and famine. The Chinese have vision.\u201dNot everyone is comfortable with China\u2019s vision. Some worry about the leverage China wields and what happens when countries fall behind on loan payments.For Djibouti, the debt is especially daunting, amounting to 60 percent of its gross domestic product. But Ilyas Moussa Dawaleh, the country\u2019s finance minister, dismissed such concerns, saying Djibouti\u2019s heady 6.7 percent growth rate would allow it to meet its loan payments.\u201cIf we don\u2019t take this risk now and develop our infrastructure, we will remain stuck in poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cCome back in a few years, and you will find that Djibouti has become the logistics hub of the continent.\u201dOthers worry about the Djiboutian government\u2019s lack of transparency, its authoritarian impulses and a vexing legacy of official corruption. Mohamed Daoud Chehem, a leader of Djibouti\u2019s embattled opposition and a former presidential candidate, said the lack of information about the terms of China\u2019s loans raised questions about potential malfeasance.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about billions of dollars and complete opacity,\u201d he said. \u201cHave there been kickbacks to government officials? There is no way to know.\u201dOthers wonder what will happen to the system after the Chinese leave. European imperialists in Africa built a skein of lines, most of which fell into disrepair in the decades after their colonies achieved independence.Jamie Monson, the author of \u201cAfrica\u2019s Freedom Railway,\u201d a book documenting the legacy of the Chinese-built train linking Tanzania and Zambia, said long-term maintenance could be more challenging than initial construction. Built during the Cold War and hailed as a symbol of Chinese-African friendship, the train, the Tazara Railway, has struggled to maintain regular service, prompting talk of a Chinese takeover.\u201cWithout proper maintenance comes problems, which can have a huge impact on a regional economy and local people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d she said.Although workers from China did much of the technical and engineering work, thousands of Djiboutian and Ethiopian laborers were hired to lay tracks and dig tunnels, helping to head off some of the local resentment that has dogged other Chinese projects in Africa. The system will be operated by Chinese conductors for five years and then turned over to local citizens, many of them trained in China.After a boisterous opening day ceremony in the broiling sun, only the best-connected attendees were allowed to board the train, which filled with applause and song as it glided out of the station.Daha Ahmed Osman, 34, a tech specialist who works for the Djiboutian government, displayed a wide grin as he watched the arid, harshly beautiful landscape spill across the train\u2019s picture windows.He predicted that the new train would transform Djibouti and Ethiopia, and eventually all of Africa. \u201cFor this, we have the Chinese to thank, because they shared with us their money and their technology,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than anything we thank them for showing confidence in us.\u201dAn article on Feb. 8 about the debut of Africa\u2019s first electric transnational railway, built by China, referred incorrectly to the $50 billion a year in financial transactions that affect Chinese companies in Africa. They are earning that amount, not spending it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Secession Advocate Faces Scrutiny Over Where He\u2019s Based: Russia", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWord of \u201cCalexit,\u201d a quixotic idea that has floated around California for years, spread on social media after the election of Mr. Trump in November. Even though it has virtually no chance of succeeding \u2014 it would require an amendment to the Constitution \u2014 it has gained some traction in the state. Several technology industry leaders have voiced their support, and a ballot measure is in the works for the 2018 election.Now with renewed attention on the movement, Mr. Marinelli is under scrutiny for living in a country that many in the United States see as an adversarial power.Russians who meet Mr. Marinelli sometimes mistake him for a political refugee from the United States, assuming he would be repressed for his antigovernment positions at home.Mr. Marinelli, who said he supported only nonviolent means of opposition, described his presence in Russia as coincidental, and he denied any links to Russian officials. Before the American presidential election, Mr. Marinelli said he saw no harm in taking a year off to teach English in Russia; his movement had been only creeping along anyway, financed with his credit card and run from his home in San Diego.Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and the subsequent boom in interest in the push for secession caught him unprepared.\u201cWe just had that surprise event of Donald Trump winning, and it just dumped thousands and thousands of people behind our campaign all of a sudden,\u201d Mr. Marinelli said in an interview in his home office here that doubles as a bedroom, and is festooned with a California flag.The campaign got a new fillip in January when the state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, approved language for a Yes California-backed ballot measure for the 2018 election, clearing the way for signature gathering. It has also earned about $60,000 in donations, Mr. Marinelli said. The measure would ask voters to remove a reference in the state\u2019s Constitution to California as an inseparable part of the United States and set a second vote, for March 2019, that would ask, \u201cShould California become a free, sovereign and independent country?\u201d But backers need to collect 585,407 valid signatures, a daunting task.In the United States Constitution, Mr. Carrillo said, \u201cthere is no procedure for allowing states to leave, and if you want a practical example, there is the Civil War.\u201dStill, Mr. Marinelli said he believed the support was there.A former Republican turned liberal political activist, he said he turned to teaching English in Russia to pay the bills and because his wife is Russian. They met during an earlier teaching stint, and he said he intended to return to California when his contract expires in June.He described it as largely a cultural center, where he will promote what he refers to as liberal Californian values like marriage equality and an easing of immigration policy.\u201cA lot of misinformation goes out about us, such as I know President Vladimir Putin or work in the Kremlin,\u201d Mr. Marinelli said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny, because if we had secret Russian support, we wouldn\u2019t be open. I live in Russia. I would have to hide that, not promote it. We have nothing to hide. We\u2019re doing some good work here. We\u2019re going to continue to do that.\u201dWorking from his Russian apartment, Mr. Marinelli is busy now coordinating the signature drive. He believes the most fruitful opportunities to enlist support in California will be found where opponents of Mr. Trump are thickest, such as outside organic grocery stores or farmers\u2019 markets.\u201cWe still have progress to be made on women\u2019s rights and equality, and L.G.B.T. rights, and the justice reform we have been fighting for,\u201d Mr. Marinelli said. Breaking up the United States is the solution, he said. \u201cI feel like achieving this would be like killing seven or eight birds with one stone. As an independent country, we could do these things.\u201dHe also wants to prohibit outside meddling in California politics with a rule banning out-of-state campaign donations \u2014 something courts have previously struck down on free-speech grounds \u2014 though presumably no ban on foreign-based organizing. \u201cThe people of California alone should determine their own future,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Hillsdale College, a \u2018Shining City on a Hill\u2019 for Conservatives", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first, Hillsdale College seems to resemble dozens of other small liberal arts schools with rich histories. There are statues of Washington and Lincoln, Jefferson and Churchill, and a monument to students who fought for the Union \u2014 a point of pride at a college that was founded by abolitionists, visited by the crusading former slave Frederick Douglass and open to black students and women from its founding in 1844.Cross the quad on what is known as the Liberty Walk, though, and you encounter something different: statues of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. If it isn\u2019t ready to add a bronzed Donald J. Trump to this pantheon, this is one college, at least, where his presidency is viewed with more hope than dread. In a letter to prospective donors, Hillsdale\u2019s president, Larry P. Arnn, said that 2017 promises a \u201cbeginning to restore limited government.\u201dHillsdale, a private college of 1,400 students in southern Michigan that describes itself as \u201cnonsectarian Christian\u201d and dedicated to \u201ccivil and religious liberty,\u201d is scarcely known in many circles. But among erudite conservatives \u2014 think progeny of William F. Buckley Jr. \u2014 it is considered a hidden gem.What they admire is the college\u2019s concentration on the Western philosophical and literary canon (sometimes disparaged as the Great Books of dead white men) and its reverent treatment of the American founding documents as the political culmination of that tradition \u2014 a tradition that scholars at Hillsdale say has been desecrated by a century of governmental overreach, including the New Deal and Obamacare.Conservatives are also entranced by Hillsdale\u2019s decision to forgo any federal or state funds so as to be \u201cunfettered\u201d by government mandates. In 1984, in Grove City College v. Bell, the Supreme Court ruled that even Pell grants for needy students or G.I. Bill money for veterans subjects a college to federal regulations, and so Hillsdale students are not allowed to accept such funds (most receive institutional grants). As a result, the college does not follow Title IX guidelines on sex discrimination and the handling of sexual assault cases and it has refused to engage in the otherwise required reporting on student race and ethnicity, let alone develop an affirmative action plan. Not surprisingly, the school\u2019s \u201crace blind\u201d admissions policy results in an overwhelmingly white student body.George F. Will, the conservative columnist, praised both the college\u2019s independence and its curriculum, saying that \u201cby stressing the Great Books and Western civilization, Hillsdale has become a niche success.\u201d He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s greatly regrettable that it\u2019s only a niche.\u201dThe election of Mr. Trump, claiming a conservative mantle but with an erratic record, has forced questions about the true meaning of conservatism into the spotlight. Under the leadership of Dr. Arnn, a prominent conservative intellectual, Hillsdale has been working not only to provide an example in the classroom but also to press its stance nationally on what it calls the threats to constitutional liberty \u2014 ideas that feed into conservative Republican politics.The most popular of Hillsdale\u2019s free online courses, Constitution 101 \u2014 10 weeks of lectures by faculty members, with recommended readings \u2014 has been taken by more than 800,000, according to the college, and has offered intellectual ballast to Tea Party activists. \u201cBy educating millions of Americans on our founding principles of liberty,\u201d the college writes of its goals, \u201cAmerica can begin to turn around and restore lost liberty.\u201dIn Washington, Hillsdale plays an active role in an ecosystem of conservative thought and policy. It joined with the Heritage Foundation to run a fellowship program for congressional staff members. Its D.C. outpost, the Allan P. Kirby Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship, runs a lecture series and serves as a base for Hillsdale undergraduates who are interning at conservative think tanks or publications. Aiming to nurture its vision of classical education, the college has also helped establish K-12 charter schools across the country.\u2022Dr. Arnn arrived at Hillsdale in 2000 as a healer on a campus rocked by scandal (his predecessor had resigned after publicity over an alleged affair and a suicide). Previously president of the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank in California, Dr. Arnn seems to personify Hillsdale, teaching the ancient Greeks and Shakespeare and publishing books on Churchill and the Constitution. An ebullient man with a short beard who speaks with faint traces of his native Arkansas, he has been known to swoop down on hapless victims in the cafeteria and pose the core question of the Classics: \u201cWhat is The Good?\u201dIn his office, beneath a portrait of Churchill, he did not gush over Mr. Trump but stressed what he sees as the overriding imperative. \u201cIf he attacks the regulatory state,\u201d Dr. Arnn said, \u201cthat will be for the good.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s rise has posed the same quandary on this campus as it has among conservatives beyond it. Dr. Arnn\u2019s decision last year to endorse him raised eyebrows on a divided campus and in wider circles (National Review had famously declared \u201cNever Trump\u201d). Mr. Trump had even considered Dr. Arnn for secretary of education, but he was ultimately passed over.\u201cPeople said to me, \u2018You love Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, how can you support Trump?\u2019 I said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they were in the race.\u2019\u2009\u201dAfter election night, the campus did not see weeping, nor wide rejoicing. A survey of students by the school paper found that just 49 percent had voted for Mr. Trump; others voted for third-party candidates or did not vote; 4 percent voted for Hillary Clinton. By comparison, 90 percent of students voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. But perhaps only at Hillsdale would a student cite Aristotle\u2019s emphasis on \u201cthe practicality of prudence\u201d in an op-ed urging classmates to get behind the new president.Hillsdale attracts students from across the country (only a third are from Michigan), and they don\u2019t wind up there by accident. Many said their parents received Hillsdale\u2019s newsletter, Imprimis, featuring speeches by conservative thinkers. Some said they had heard Dr. Arnn on one of his regular appearances on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s syndicated radio program. They were also attracted by the moderate cost. Hillsdale is well financed with private donations, and college officials said that 95 percent of students this year received grants averaging $17,206, to offset the $35,722 for tuition, room and board.5 PhotosIn a commonly expressed sentiment, Kaitlyn Johns, a senior economics major with a music minor, said she came to Hillsdale \u201cbecause I felt like I would actually be challenged here.\u201d Tara Ung, a junior, chose Hillsdale because of the classics emphasis. A political science major \u201cwith a Latin minor for fun,\u201d she said she particularly enjoyed her internship in Washington with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, and was now helping to form an undergraduate chapter of the Federalist Society.In this isolated location, students like to form clubs, on everything from politics to cigar smoking to highland dancing. One that does not exist at Hillsdale College is an L.G.B.T.Q. organization. Openly gay or lesbian students are a rarity, and The Princeton Review consistently ranks Hillsdale among the 20 least L.G.B.T.Q.-friendly campuses.A public furor erupted in 2015 when the chaplain sent out a campuswide email calling for prayer against the \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cugly\u201d possibility that the Supreme Court would legalize same-sex marriage. College leaders admonished him for his tenor, though not the message: \u201cThe tone and language of the email did not properly represent our commitment to thoughtful inquiry and civil discussion,\u201d the provost, David M. Whalen, said in a statement.Founded by Free Will Baptists, the college wears its religion lightly, without requiring a pledge of faith like some evangelical institutions. The student body includes a significant minority of Roman Catholics; students studying the Reformation in their core curriculum joke about re-enacting its debates over lunch. Classes are small and personal. \u201cThe entire freshman class is reading the same stuff at the same time, and the class spills over into the lunchroom,\u201d said Paul A. Rahe, a history professor.The soul of Hillsdale is its core curriculum, which largely occupies students for their first two years. It includes more than a dozen mandatory survey courses on topics like the Western heritage (with readings from Hammurabi to Hobbes) and American heritage (the Mayflower Compact to inaugural addresses by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Reagan). Students also must study core principles of biology, chemistry and physics and take the trademark class on the American Constitution.Beyond admiring the stress on traditional rigor and methods, conservatives more widely venerate the Great Books, approached in a certain way. They laud the reading of original texts, gleaning eternal ideas of right and wrong rather than dwelling on the often less noble historical contexts. Hence, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are exalted for recognizing the natural rights of man and role of government as protector of those rights. The Constitution\u2019s enshrinement of slavery, in this view, was a horrid expediency to win adoption in the South \u2014 a malignancy that ultimately had to be excised in blood rather than an indelible original sin.\u201cIn principle, studying Great Books is not inherently conservative,\u201d said Molly Worthen, an assistant professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who laments that this ground has been largely ceded by liberals.\u201cThere is a tradition that grew out of ancient Greece and Rome that is shared by modern progressives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the study of the Great Books has become entwined with a certain set of methodological assumptions and political or ideological goals.\u201dIn a telling moment during my campus visit, a student tour guide brought a prospective student and her parents to the rare-book room in the library. \u201cI\u2019d learned in class about Tocqueville\u2019s idea of the danger posed to liberty by overvaluing equality, and how that is relevant today,\u201d the guide said. \u201cThis was really brought home to me, seeing an original translation of Tocqueville here in the Heritage Room.\u201dThe guide could have learned that point in the class that Dr. Rahe taught last fall, a deep dive into Montesquieu, Rousseau and Tocqueville with the suggestive title drawn from one of the professor\u2019s books: \u201cSoft Despotism, Democracy\u2019s Drift.\u201dStill, in several classes that I observed, the teachers encouraged spirited exchanges and broached topics far beyond conservative dogma. Dr. Whalen, for example, an English professor as well as provost, ended his course \u201cGreat Books in Continental Literature\u201d with a look at Samuel Beckett\u2019s \u201cEndgame.\u201d \u201cWhat happens if there is no meaning there, but you have an absurd need to express meaning?\u201d he asked of Beckett\u2019s vision. One student drew a comparison to the music of John Cage, which he had studied in another class.The course on the Constitution includes intense study of the Federalist papers and the later statements of Progressives like John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson and F.D.R. Hillsdale teachings describe the Constitution as a timeless document whose principles have been compromised by the creep of welfare and regulation.The more mainstream view is offered by Joseph J. Ellis, author of several books on the founders, who he says intended that the Constitution be \u201ca living document.\u201d \u201cThe conservative narrative,\u201d he told me, \u201cdefies the evolution of the United States into a major industrial superpower that requires federal institutions to regulate corporations and manage a much larger set of interests.\u201dIf one subject captures the juxtaposition of Hillsdale\u2019s pathbreaking origins with its present-day conservatism, it is race. From the official catalog: \u201cThe college values the merit of each unique individual, rather than succumbing to the dehumanizing, discriminatory trend of so-called \u2018social justice\u2019 and \u2018multicultural diversity.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn 2013, Dr. Arnn was castigated by Michigan legislators when, during testimony against the Common Core, he made a remark about officials who questioned Hillsdale\u2019s racial record. Years before, he said scornfully, Michigan officials had come to the campus with clipboards, trying to count faces and prove, he said, that the college \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough dark ones.\u201d He later issued a barbed apology: \u201cNo offense was intended by the use of that term except to the offending bureaucrats.\u201dTo me, Dr. Arnn said: \u201cI think it is an urgent thing for the college to help those who are disadvantaged.\u201d He cited the charter school initiative as a response that fits Hillsdale\u2019s values. Hillsdale has received private grants to foster K-12 schools, funded with public money, that introduce children to the ancient Greeks and constitutional principles and require the study of Latin. Hillsdale serves as a consultant \u2014 without payment, again avoiding government funds \u2014 providing local organizers a curriculum and teacher training. So far it is aiding 16 schools \u2014 three of them, one in Georgia and two in Texas, serving mainly minority populations, Dr. Arnn said.\u201cWe hope that a lot of those students will come here,\u201d he said. In the meantime, Hillsdale defiantly claims an exemplary record of opposition to racial discrimination. As if to drive home the point, the college is adding one more bronze to its Liberty Walk this spring: a statue of Frederick Douglass.An article on Page 16 this weekend about Hillsdale, a conservative college in Michigan, misspells the surname of a student who chose it because of its emphasis on classics. She is Tara Ung, not Ang.Erik Eckholm is a former editor and reporter for The Times who most recently covered national legal affairs. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018World\u2019s Worst Skier\u2019 Has Best Explanation: He Never Trained on Snow", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new name may have been added to the list of plucky but noncompetitive winter sportsmen \u2014 a ledger that includes Eddie the Eagle (Michael Edwards) and the 1988 Jamaican Olympic bobsled team \u2014 after Adrian Solano wobbled his way onto and then around the course this week at the Nordic world ski championships in Lahti, Finland. Commentators who witnessed his every fall there quickly called him the \u201cworld\u2019s worst skier ever.\u201dTo anyone aware of his back story, however, the reason behind his shakiness was understandable: Until arriving at the competition this week, Solano, a Venezuelan, had never set foot on, nor even seen, snow. Until his debut, Solano, 22, carried out all his training for the championships on wheels under the blazing South American sun.In his opening event, the cross-country 10-kilometer in a qualifying round on Wednesday, Solano wore Bib No. 1 and was first out of the gate. He lost his balance almost immediately, proceeding to fall on the descents and to perform variations of the splits on the inclines, persistently losing his footing.After completing the first 3.5 kilometers in 39 minutes 37 seconds \u2014 roughly the same amount of time it took the other competitors to complete the entire 10-kilometer course \u2014 Solano decided to call it a day, retiring from the event altogether.\u201cThe most difficult part was going uphill; it required a lot of energy and was exhausting,\u201d Solano said in a telephone interview through a translator on Friday. \u201cThis is a very unconventional thing and everything is so new. But I am a very daring person.\u201dSimply getting to the championships was a struggle for Solano, who works as a cook in Maracay, Venezuela. He decided to take up roller skiing about a year ago, basing his decision on simply being someone who likes \u201ctrying difficult things.\u201d Under the guidance of C\u00e9sar Baena, a Venezuelan cross-country skier who was able to provide him with equipment, he practiced for five hours a day on weekends in hopes of one day representing Venezuela on actual powder, and perhaps at the Olympics.As the skier\u2019s troubles received news media attention in the Nordic countries, one reader, Aleksi Valavuori, a sports and television personality in Finland, saw Solano\u2019s story and decided to contact Baena, the coach, through event organizers and offer his support.\u201cI felt somebody had to react on it because the story was so unfair,\u201d Valavuori said. \u201cSomeone from pretty poor conditions had a dream, he was already in Paris, and that dream was taken away for him.\u201dValavuori and Baena first spoke on Monday and figured out that if they could raise enough money for Solano\u2019s airfare and accommodation, the skier could still take one of the latest possible flights out of Venezuela and make his first event on Wednesday afternoon.After setting up a GoFundMe page on Monday just after 5 p.m., local time, Valavuori turned to his more than 100,000 followers on social media. In about three hours, the campaign amassed the 2,000 euros Solano needed at least to buy his airfare, and the skier boarded a flight to Finland. (The campaign eventually reached its overall goal of 4,000 euros, and three main sponsors have since helped with Solano\u2019s expenses.)\u201cWhen he arrived, it was like love at first sight with everybody,\u201d Valavuori said. \u201cBut he only told me about having not seen snow after he got here.\u201dHaving failed to finish the first event, Solano set a goal of simply completing his second and final race, the 1.6-kilometer cross-country sprint. He placed 156th \u2014 last \u2014 but was all smiles.\u201cWe have a success culture that sports is only great if you succeed,\u201d Valavuori said. \u201cI want to get rid of that. You get some wins, you get some losses. But there are so many other things in sports. It\u2019s all about the story.\u201dOn Friday, Solano announced his intention to raise money for Finnish junior skiing as a thank you to those who helped finance his trip to Lahti. He also said he planned to continue skiing in Venezuela and hoped to practice more frequently on snow. His long-term goal is to compete in the 2022 Winter Olympics.\u201cThe part I actually enjoyed the most was falling down,\u201d Solano said of his experience this week, \u201cbecause now I am more motivated to get up and keep achieving my goal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Tried to Upend Banks. Now It Works With Them.", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2011, Brett King was promoting his book, \u201cBreaking Banks,\u201d and creating a start-up that he hoped would do to the banks what Amazon did to the retail industry and Facebook did to media.\u201cWe had grand ideas of being the Facebook of banking, and being a new form of bank account,\u201d Mr. King said recently.Six years later, his company, Moven, has opened only 60,000 of those new bank accounts. Mr. King has now transitioned to selling his software to the banks he once scorned, who use it as a component of their mobile apps.\u201cWe realized that if you want millions of users as a bank, it is a very different proposition than building a social media network,\u201d he said.Silicon Valley has upended a growing number of industries, and it had seemed not too long ago that Wall Street would soon be next. A flurry of financial start-ups rose quickly and grabbed billions of dollars in investments.Mr. King is just one of the many technology entrepreneurs who have since recently run into the enormous moats that surround and protect the existing financial industry.The venture capitalists who have invested billions of dollars in this wave of new financial technology \u2014 think Venmo and Bitcoin \u2014 have been left waiting for a breakout star that actually looks like a threat to even a part of the big banks\u2019 business.\u201cA lot of people set out saying, \u2018We are going to displace the banks,\u2019\u201d said Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist at 500 Startups who focuses on financial technology. \u201cWe realized along the way that you really have no choice but to work with the banks.\u201dAnd the difficulty of denting the influence and power of the big banks is only likely to get harder under the Trump administration.President Trump has said he wants to encourage innovation and new business by cutting back on regulations of all sorts, including financial regulations.Yet it was the regulations passed after the financial crisis that forced the big banks to reduce their risks in many areas and provided an opening for start-ups like Moven, which were willing to take more risks.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle those post-crisis regulations is widely expected to give the big banks more free rein and close the window of opportunity for newcomers.\u201cThe degree to which banks have been caught under the yoke of regulatory obligations is very likely to lighten up under Trump,\u201d said Arjan Sch\u00fctte, the founder of the venture capital firm Core Innovation Capital, which focuses on financial technology.Mr. Sch\u00fctte has been moving his firm\u2019s investments away from bank disrupters and toward start-ups that are set up to partner with existing financial institutions.Even if there has not been a disruption of the big banks, basic financial services available to consumers are changing rapidly, nonetheless.Americans are now able to send each other money instantly from their phones, thanks to Venmo, and can get approved for a loan in minutes, also from their phone.The consulting firm McKinsey estimated in a report last month that digital disruption could put $90 billion, or 25 percent of bank profits, at risk over the next three years as services become more automated and more tellers are replaced by chatbots.Much of this change, however, is now expected to come from the banks themselves as they absorb new ideas from the technology world and shrink their own operations, without necessarily losing significant numbers of customers to start-ups.Venmo, for, instance, has captured the wallets of many young Americans, but the largest banks have all begun their own versions of the service and some of them say that they already process, as single banks, more instant personal payments than Venmo.The large banks are also teaming up to start a cross-industry mobile phone application, Zelle, that will take Venmo head-on in 2017.Venmo, which was acquired by PayPal, is still trying to find a way to make money from the business, which is currently offered primarily as a free service.Financial start-ups are not facing the same challenges everywhere in the world. In China, the technology company Ant Financial has grown to 450 million users since spinning off from the e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Ant Financial now processes a majority of online payments in China.Ant Financial has used its position as an electronic, phone-based wallet to grab lots of other financial business from Chinese consumers, offering online loans, insurance and investment advice to its hundreds of millions of customers.China has four of the five most valuable financial technology start-ups in the world, according to CB Insights, with Ant Financial leading the way at $60 billion. And investments in financial technology rose 64 percent in China last year, while they were falling 29 percent in the United States, according to CB Insights.In Africa, the financial industry has been shaken up by the rise of new forms of mobile phone-based payment systems like M-Pesa, in Kenya, which was started by the local mobile phone operator rather than a bank, and has risen to become the dominant form of payment in the country.The obvious reason that financial start-ups have not achieved the same level of growth in the United States is that most Americans already have access to a relatively functional set of financial products, unlike in Africa and China.Some start-ups looked at becoming banks, so they could offer deposit insurance \u2014 among other things \u2014 but they generally found that getting a bank charter required more time and money than is available to even the most successful start-ups. This left most start-ups reliant on banks to hold and move any money they collected from customers.\u201cOperating in America, you needed to get a gatekeeper to approve your access to the networks,\u201d said Josh Reich, who sold his banking start-up, Simple, to the Spanish banking giant BBVA. \u201cIf we wanted to touch their money, we needed to be part of the banking system.\u201dOnline lenders were particularly ambitious in trying to take on the banks from outside the system. Lending Club, which makes personal loans, and OnDeck, which focuses on small business loans, initially grew swiftly and went public, but both companies have run up against the limits of how fast a lending business can grow without being a bank.The online lenders have struggled with the high cost of acquiring new customers through marketing, which is not as necessary in other industries that have been disrupted by technology.At a more fundamental level, online lenders realized how hard it was to fund the new loans they wanted to give out without having access to cheap deposits, as the banks do.The shares of both Lending Club and OnDeck are now trading far below where they were on the day they went public.One notable success among the new lenders has been SoFi, or Social Finance, but even it has captured only about 250,000 customers, as compared to the 160 million users of Snapchat, the social network that was founded the same year.Start-ups focused on improving payments have had more success \u2014 the most valuable recent American technology start-up is Stripe, which helps new companies accept online payments.But Stripe and other payment start-ups like Square are all built on top of the existing credit card and banking infrastructure and have not posed any type of fundamental threat or challenge to the existing giants.\u201cWe are explicitly not a threat to the banks,\u201d Tim Drinan, a spokesman for Stripe, said. \u201cFrom our perspective the banks and card networks have built something pretty good and pretty hard to replicate.\u201dPerhaps the most ambitious recent project aimed at upending the banks was Bitcoin, which promised a new way to hold and move money, totally outside the existing banking system.The virtual currency has not taken off as a way to hold and spend money on a day-to-day basis, as many of its enthusiasts had predicted.At the same time, in a pattern that has been repeated elsewhere in the financial industry, the big banks have been making big investments aimed at harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin \u2014 known as the blockchain \u2014 for their own purposes.Tim Swanson, an early Bitcoin follower and analyst who now works with the blockchain consulting firm R3, said that Bitcoin wasn\u2019t able to fulfill the marketing promises that were made for it back in 2012.\u201cIt may take some time, but if there is anyone that has the capital base and the developer base to see this through, it\u2019s the banks for sure,\u201d Mr. Swanson said.An article on Thursday about technology start-ups\u2019 efforts to take on the financial industry misstated the year that PayPal acquired Venmo. It was 2013, not 2009.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did Sectarian Politics Win in Jakarta? Only the Runoff Will Tell", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 This week\u2019s bitterly contested election for governor of Jakarta \u2014 pitting a Christian incumbent charged with blaspheming Islam against two rivals who emphasized their Muslim faith \u2014 was widely seen as a test of whether Indonesia\u2019s young democracy could resist the pull of sectarian politics.Whether it passed that test is still an open question.But his poll numbers were substantially higher before October, when his political opponents accused him of blasphemy. And because Mr. Basuki did not win a majority of the vote, he will face the second-place finisher, Anies Baswedan, in an April runoff.Mr. Anies, a former minister of education and culture, finished just a few percentage points behind Mr. Basuki, according to the polling agencies. Some analysts said they expected Mr. Anies to gain the support of many voters who had backed the third candidate \u2014 who, like him, had emphasized his Muslim identity during the campaign.\u201cI\u2019m surprised this kind of situation happened in Jakarta,\u201d said Muhammad Qodari, executive director of Indo Barometer, a polling company, \u201cbecause Jakartans are tolerant, and religious sentiment should not have played such a big role in the election.\u201dEarly this month, Mr. Muhammad said, 70 percent of registered Jakarta voters who participated in a survey said they approved of Mr. Basuki\u2019s work as governor. But more than half of those people said they would not vote for the governor because they believed he had insulted Islam, Mr. Muhammad said.More than 85 percent of the capital\u2019s registered voters are Muslims.\u201cReligious sentiment played a significant role and undermined the performance of Ahok in this election,\u201d Mr. Muhammad said.Supporters of Mr. Basuki have accused his political opponents of orchestrating the demonstrations to sabotage his campaign. Before the protests, he had been polling as high as 52 percent, a level of support that would have enabled him to win Wednesday\u2019s election outright.Mr. Basuki is only the second non-Muslim governor in Jakarta\u2019s history, and if elected he would be the first non-Muslim directly elected to the prominent post. He inherited the position after his predecessor, Joko Widodo, was elected president in 2014.Indonesia is the world\u2019s most populous predominantly Muslim nation, with 190 million adherents to the faith. But it has influential Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities, and it has had a secular Constitution and government since 1945, the year it gained independence.In recent years, however, fears of \u201ccreeping Islamization\u201d have emerged. Autonomous provincial, district and city governments have passed hundreds of bylaws inspired by Islamic law, or Shariah, over the past decade. Most of the regulations single out women \u2014 enforcing dress and morality codes \u2014 while others target religious minorities and gay, lesbian and transgender Indonesians.Analysts have expressed fear that if sectarian politics prevails in Indonesia\u2019s relatively cosmopolitan, well-educated capital, it would bode ill for secularism in the rest of the country.\u201cReligion had a big impact in this election,\u201d said Benny Susetyo, a senior leader of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Indonesia, who said that Mr. Basuki\u2019s two opponents in the election had \u201cmanipulated religion\u201d by emphasizing that they were Muslim.\u201cWe have already had problems with radical Islamists and with terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying.\u201dOther analysts, however, were encouraged by the fact that Mr. Basuki had finished first on Wednesday, despite a campaign charged with ethnic and sectarian tension.\u201cI think the headline should be that Jakartans took a step forward against intolerance,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Winters, a professor of political science at Northwestern University and a longtime observer of Indonesian affairs.\u201cThey ignored the call that Muslims can only vote for Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople trying to frame politics in religious terms have failed.\u201dThat remains to be confirmed. Some analysts expect most supporters of the candidate who came in third on Wednesday \u2014 Agus Yudhoyono, who conceded after receiving an estimated 17 percent of the vote \u2014 to back Mr. Anies, who has deftly promoted his Muslim faith and Javanese ethnicity, in the second round.But machinations among Indonesia\u2019s large secular parties, which dominate national politics, may influence matters, some analysts say.Mr. Yudhoyono is out of the race, but his father, former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, is the chairman of the Democratic Party, and he could sway the election, they say. Mr. Basuki\u2019s Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, and the opposition Gerindra party of Mr. Anies, are said to be courting Mr. Yudhoyono for resources and voters.Former President Yudhoyono was accused of helping to finance the protests against Mr. Basuki to help his son\u2019s campaign. He has denied those accusations.\u201cThe battle continues, and it\u2019s too early to say whether the pluralists will win, or the Islamic extremists on the other side,\u201d said Bonar Tigor Naipospos, vice chairman of the executive board of the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace in Jakarta, a research institute. \u201cEverything in politics is hard to predict in Jakarta.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Agency Begins Inquiry Into Auto Lenders\u2019 Use of GPS Tracking", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey can figure out when you leave town and see where you parked your car. They can see how many times you went to the grocery store or the health clinic.Auto loans to Americans with poor credit have been booming, and many finance companies, credit unions and auto dealers are using technologies to track the location of borrowers\u2019 vehicles in case they need to repossess them.Such surveillance, lenders say, allows them to extend loans to more low- income Americans, knowing that they can easily locate the car. Lenders are also installing devices that enable them to remotely disable a car\u2019s ignition after a borrower misses a payment.Now, federal regulators are investigating whether these devices unfairly violate a borrower\u2019s\u2019 privacy.The auto lender Credit Acceptance Corporation said this month in a securities filing that it had received a civil investigative demand from the Federal Trade Commission asking for its \u201cpolicies, practices and procedures\u201d related to so-called GPS starter interrupter devices, which are used to disable an ignition.Industry lawyers say the action is part of a broader inquiry by the agency into tracking technologies used in the subprime auto lending market.An agency spokesman declined to comment on the investigative demand.\u201cFinding out where people are located can reveal a lot about what people are doing in their lives,\u201d said Lauren Smith, policy counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum, a think tank focused on privacy issues. \u201cLocation data is very sensitive.\u201dIf the federal agency determines that the devices are being used unfairly or deceptively, it could force companies to stop the behavior and devise procedures and monitoring to ensure that customer privacy is better protected.The regulatory scrutiny over the GPS starter interrupter devices comes as cracks are starting to appear in the red-hot auto loan market. The percentage of auto loans that were at least 90 days delinquent increased to 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 3.6 percent in the third quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkIn determining whether to take action, the Federal Trade Commission must first decide whether the benefit to consumers \u2014 in this case the availability of auto loans \u2014 outweighs the privacy problems.The auto finance industry says the benefits of the devices are clear. Without them, many low-income Americans would not be able to buy cars that they need to get to work.So far, there is no widespread evidence that lenders are misusing information they track from a vehicle\u2019s whereabouts.Jack Tracey, executive director of the National Automotive Finance Association, said the privacy fears were unfounded.\u201cThis is a registered vehicle,\u201d Mr. Tracey said. \u201cIt has a license plate, and you can see where it is traveling. You are driving something that isn\u2019t private anywhere.\u201dManufacturers of the devices note that they have clear guidelines in place to protect privacy. The GPS capabilities, they say, are intended to help lenders locate a car once a borrower goes into default, not to be used simply as a surveillance tool.As an added protection, some manufacturers said, they built their devices so that the GPS is not activated until a borrower defaults.But privacy experts and many borrowers who have the devices in their cars say there is great potential for abuse, particularly because the devices fall outside traditional state and federal lending laws.Some find it unsettling that the technology gives lenders so much control over borrowers \u2014 particularly poor borrowers, who typically have no choice but to accept the device if they want a loan to buy a car.\u201cThey don\u2019t need to know what we are doing \u2014 when we go out to eat, when we go on vacation,\u201d said Elias Sanchez, a forklift operator in Austin, Tex. \u201cWe want our privacy.\u201d His auto dealer didn\u2019t tell him that a GPS tracking device had been installed in his 2005 Ford S.U.V., he said.A mother in Las Vegas described in the article how she had been unable to get her feverish child to a hospital because her car had been shut off for a missed payment. Other borrowers have complained in interviews of being stranded, marooned in dangerous neighborhoods and cut off from their cars when they needed it the most. In Nevada, one woman testified to the Legislature that her car had been shut down on a freeway.Some state lawmakers have taken note. The New Jersey Legislature is working to revise a bill, vetoed this month by Gov. Chris Christie, that would strengthen the disclosure requirements and add consumer protections to the devices. Under the bill, consumers would get written disclosures that a device had been installed in their car and at least 72 hours\u2019 notice before the ignition was disabled.The Federal Trade Commission has brought several regulatory actions against businesses in recent years over privacy violations.Privacy is expected to remain a focus of the Federal Trade Commission even as several new members are due to be appointed during the Trump administration.\u201cPrivacy issues seem to garner bipartisan support,\u201d said Christopher Kukla, executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, a research and advocacy group focused on consumer finance. \u201cWe will have to see if that is something they will be able to move forward on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Floors in the living areas are African teak hardwood, and most walls are painted brick. Off the entry is a living room, separated from an open kitchen by a bookcase. The eat-in kitchen has stainless-steel appliances, and the open dining area flows into another living room with a fireplace and a swing. Beyond the fireplace is the master bedroom, which has an en-suite bathroom with a sunken tub. Bedrooms and bathrooms have walls and floors of polished cement and in-floor heating. Off the master bath is a patio with a spiral staircase to the roof.The building is on Passatge Sert, a quiet pedestrian street in the neighborhood of El Born. The building is on the edge of the Eixample district, with the Placa de Catalunya and Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Barcelona\u2019s main shopping street, within 12 minutes by foot, the beach about a half-hour. Coffee shops, restaurants, boutiques and markets are nearby, as are stops for the metro, train and airport shuttle bus, Mr. Thoene said. The airport is about a 30-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cFrom 2014, there were a lot of international and institutional investors coming into Spain, and that really brought confidence back into the market,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly last year prices started going up slightly, but they\u2019re not yet close to recovery.\u201dWhile prices in popular neighborhoods such as the Eixample, Ciutat Vella and El Born, which are all popular with foreign home seekers, increased by 18 percent last year, Barcelona is still a bargain compared with other large European cities, including London and Paris, Mr. Thoene said.Refurbished apartments of about 100 square meters (or 1,076 square feet) in the city center can be had for about 5,000 euros a square meter, or about $500 a square foot, Mr. Vaughan said.

{"Headline": "Yahoo and Verizon Are Said to Be Near a Cheaper Deal", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Soon after Yahoo disclosed the first of two enormous data breaches that threatened to upend a $4.8 billion deal it had reached with Verizon Communications, the embattled company began to confront an unpleasant potential future.Yahoo could have battled Verizon to preserve the original price tag, a campaign that could have ended up in a Delaware courtroom \u2014 and led to months of bitter legal wrangling. Moreover, that strategy would have run the risk of allowing Verizon to walk away from the purchase altogether.Instead, Yahoo is close to renegotiating its original deal, choosing to take close to $300 million off the price to preserve the sale, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.Under the revised terms, the two companies are expected to share legal responsibility and costs for the data breaches, the person with knowledge of the matter said.The new deal is expected to be announced within days, this person added.Representatives for both companies declined to comment on the discussions.On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed additional information stemming from the breaches, notifying some users that it had found evidence of attempts to log in to their accounts without a password. Those attempts were made using data stolen in the 2014 hacking.Yahoo did not ask the users to change their passwords but urged them to use account key, an optional feature that uses a smartphone to validate all attempted logins on a Yahoo account.Verizon executives had earlier mused publicly about the severity of the Yahoo breaches and whether they had a material effect on the companies\u2019 deal, announced in July.Analysts, however, said Verizon, a telecommunications giant, had plenty of reasons to complete the transaction quickly, particularly to build up its digital media business.Verizon\u2019s core business, wireless phone service, is being hurt by stiffened competition from AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. Verizon was recently forced to bring back unlimited data plans to match its rivals\u2019 offerings.For Yahoo, salvaging the deal was even more vital.In putting its core internet business \u2014 including its still-popular email service, Yahoo Finance and sports arms \u2014 up for sale last year, the company sought to end years of questions about its declining business and whether it could effect a turnaround. A succession of chief executives, most recently Marissa Mayer, tried but failed, and investor discontent was high.After a highly public sales process, Verizon emerged the winner.Verizon sought Yahoo as part of its effort to build a digital media empire anchored by its earlier purchase of AOL, another aging internet property. AOL could not achieve the scale necessary to challenge Google and Facebook on its own, and Yahoo\u2019s business was meant to play a crucial role, bringing in more than a billion users.Verizon\u2019s archrival, AT&T, is also building a new business line in media. But in seeking to acquire Time Warner for $85 billion, it is aiming for a much greater scale more quickly.Still, the hacking disclosures appeared to rattle Verizon\u2019s plans.In September, Yahoo revealed that intruders it believed were backed by a foreign government had stolen the data, including encrypted passwords, of 500 million user accounts in 2014.Two months ago, Yahoo announced that an even larger breach, involving a billion accounts, had occurred in 2013. That breach compromised additional data, including security questions used to reset passwords. Yahoo forced all of the affected users to change their passwords.In both cases, there is evidence that Yahoo knew about the intrusions for some time before they were publicly disclosed.Yahoo has shared few additional details in recent months, citing continuing investigations by outside security firms, its board of directors and law enforcement authorities.Its reticence drew the ire last week of the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who sent a letter to Ms. Mayer demanding more information about the breaches and what Yahoo had done to protect its users since then.Yahoo said last month that it was confident its deal with Verizon would close by the end of June.The long delay has taken a toll on Yahoo\u2019s business. The company has continued to lose market share in digital advertising as Facebook and Google expand their dominance and shiny newcomers like Snapchat attract the attention of marketers.While waiting for the deal, Yahoo\u2019s management has focused on cutting costs, eliminating more than 2,100 jobs in the last year.Yahoo stockholders are eager to see the deal close so that Yahoo can focus on finding ways to extract the value of its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, and its 36 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group.Those investments, which are supposed to remain in a stub company called Altaba, are worth about $48 billion combined.Advertisement"}

Rather, it says that if a religious leader endorses a candidate, then his church cannot receive the significant benefit of tax exemption, and that people cannot, therefore, make a tax-deductible contribution to that church.The conservatives clamoring for this change should think hard: They don\u2019t like their tax dollars going to support groups that perform abortions. Do they really want to pay for churches that push pro-choice candidates? They fear and distrust Islam. Do they really want their hard-earned money to back the preferred political candidates of the local Islamic center?In addition, this would likely create a huge new loophole in the campaign finance system. The donations we make to political candidates are not now tax-deductible. But if this provision is repealed, you could make a tax-deductible contribution to a church (or other charity) that is campaigning for a political candidate.Houses of worship and other charities could become unregulated vessels for campaign contributions, which taxpayers would then have to partly underwrite because they were deductible. It would be a disaster for our political system, already reeking of corruption.It also would be a disaster for religion.Political fixers will try to funnel money through houses of worship. The temptations for clergy members would be intense. Yes, let\u2019s fix the day care center in the basement!

{"Headline": "SpaceX Plans to Send 2 Tourists Around Moon in 2018", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Musk made the announcement on Monday in a telephone news conference. He said two private individuals approached the company to see if SpaceX would be willing to send them on a weeklong cruise, which would fly past the surface of the moon \u2014 but not land \u2014 and continue outward before gravity turned the spacecraft around and brought it back to Earth for a landing.\u201cThis would do a long loop around the moon,\u201d Mr. Musk said. The company is aiming to launch this moon mission in late 2018.Mr. Musk did not say how much the travelers would pay for the ride. \u201cA little bit more than the cost of a crewed mission to the space station would be,\u201d he said.The Falcon Heavy itself has a list price of $90 million.While the trip appears to be within the technical capabilities of SpaceX, industry experts wondered whether the company could pull it off as quickly as Mr. Musk indicated. \u201cDates are not SpaceX\u2019s strong suit,\u201d said Mary Lynne Dittmar, executive director of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a space advocacy group consisting of aerospace companies. The Dragon 2 and Falcon Heavy are years behind schedule and have yet to fly.\u201cIt strikes me as risky,\u201d Dr. Dittmar said, adding that autonomous systems are not infallible. \u201cI find it extraordinary that these sorts of announcements are being made when SpaceX has yet to get crew from the ground to low-Earth orbit.\u201dMr. Musk said the two would-be private space travelers wished to remain anonymous for now. He declined to describe them, except to say they knew each other.Seven space tourists have paid tens of millions of dollars to fly on Russian Soyuz rockets to visit the International Space Station, which is about 200 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface. This would be a much more distant trip. The moon is about a quarter million miles away, and the trajectory would take the capsule 300,000 to 400,000 miles from Earth.But that first launch, without anyone on board, is scheduled for late next year, taking a path similar to what Mr. Musk has proposed for his space tourists.When Mr. Musk announced the Falcon Heavy in 2011, he said it would fly in 2013. The maiden flight is now scheduled for this summer.SpaceX has a contract to take NASA astronauts to the International Space Station using the Dragon 2 capsule launched on the Falcon 9 rocket. That program has also encountered delays.NASA has financed much of SpaceX\u2019s spacecraft development, and Mr. Musk said the agency has priority. If NASA wants to put its astronauts on the Falcon Heavy\u2019s first moon flight, he said, SpaceX will comply. But the Falcon Heavy has not been through NASA\u2019s rigorous reviews to be judged safe for astronauts.Like the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Affordable Care Act Sign-Ups Dip Amid Uncertainty and Trump Attacks", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of people who signed up for health insurance in the federal marketplace that serves most states dipped this year to 9.2 million, the Trump administration said Friday, as consumers struggled with confusion over the future of the Affordable Care Act.That represents a decline of more than 4 percent from the total of 9.63 million people who signed up through HealthCare.gov at this time last year.The numbers do not include activity in the 11 states that run their own online marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. State reports suggest that they have signed up about three million people.Veterans of the Obama administration said President Trump\u2019s opposition to the health law and his efforts to undermine it had taken a toll. People may also have been influenced by signals from Congress that the law would soon be repealed. And some consumers may have been put off by the termination of their health plans, which was caused by an exodus of major insurers from the market in many states.Just before leaving office, the Obama administration reported that sign-ups through HealthCare.gov were running slightly ahead of the number at the same time last year, with 8.8 million as of Jan. 14.\u201cTrump\u2019s sabotage worked,\u201d said Ben Wakana, who was a spokesman for Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services under Mr. Obama. \u201cWe were on track to exceed last year\u2019s total. We expected a million people to sign up on the federal exchange in the final week of the open enrollment period.\u201dHow a partial replacement plan compares with the existing law.Still, the numbers present a challenge to Republicans who are struggling to repeal the law that allowed those millions to purchase insurance plans \u2014 and who have promised not to displace anyone covered by it.The fourth annual open enrollment season began Nov. 1 and ended Tuesday, 11 days after Mr. Trump took office.The order, issued within hours of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, did not specify what actions would be taken. But lawyers and health policy experts read it as an indication that the government might not enforce the federal requirement for people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.Mr. Trump has described the Affordable Care Act as \u201ca complete and total disaster\u201d and has said he wants to replace it with better, cheaper coverage \u201cfor everybody,\u201d but he has not offered a plan to achieve that goal.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, who is trying to draft a replacement for the law, said that \u201ctoday\u2019s numbers failed to keep pace with last year\u2019s.\u201d In addition, he suggested, some people who signed up will not pay their premiums and will therefore not have coverage this year.\u201cEither way,\u201d Mr. Hatch said, \u201cenrollment numbers are down, and costs are up.\u201dThat response was predicted by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader and an architect of the law.\u201cNow, Republicans will cynically point to the dip in enrollment they caused, declare the Affordable Care Act broken and move to steal the affordable health coverage of every American,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, in states committed to delivering affordable health coverage to their residents, enrollment in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces has surged.\u201d\u201cDemocrats will continue to stand our ground to ensure that every American has access to affordable health coverage,\u201d she added.Enrollment reports from the Obama administration were invariably upbeat, saying the numbers showed that people needed and wanted insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The first report from the Trump administration struck a different tone.\u201cObamacare has failed the American people, with one broken promise after another,\u201d Matt Lloyd, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday. \u201cPremiums in the A.C.A. marketplace have increased 25 percent while the number of insurers has declined 28 percent over the past year.\u201dOf the 9.2 million people who signed up through HealthCare.gov, one-third were new to the federal marketplace, and two-thirds were returning customers. The individual insurance market is in constant flux. With changes in income and employment, consumers may gain or lose coverage from Medicaid, employers and other sources of insurance.The Obama administration predicted in October that 13.8 million people would sign up for coverage in the enrollment period that ended this week. The total appears likely to fall short of that goal.Leslie Dach, a former Obama administration official who is trying to preserve the health law as a leader of the Protect Our Care Coalition, said, \u201cEnrollment was a success, and it would have been even higher without the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to suppress enrollment.\u201d Despite those efforts, he said, \u201cAmericans continued to enroll in the final weeks, proving that there is considerable demand for quality and affordable coverage.\u201dSeveral states that run their own insurance exchanges appear to have done better than the federal marketplace. In New York, 908,200 people signed up through the state marketplace for either a qualified health plan or the \u201cbasic health program\u201d authorized by the Affordable Care Act for low-income people. That represents an increase of 39 percent.Under the Obama administration, enrollment in marketplace insurance plans was consistently lower than the levels originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office, in part because consumers were more likely to get and keep employer-sponsored insurance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Coverage in Peril and Obama Gone, Health Law\u2019s Critics Go Quiet", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 For seven years, few issues have animated conservative voters as much as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But with President Barack Obama out of office, the debate over \u201cObamacare\u201d is becoming less about \u201cObama\u201d and more about \u201ccare\u201d \u2014 greatly complicating the issue for Republican lawmakers.Polling indicates that more Republicans want to make fixes to the law rather than do away with it. President Trump, who remains popular on the right, has mused about a replacement plan that is even more expansive than the original. The conservative news media are focused more on Mr. Trump\u2019s near-daily skirmishes with Democrats and reporters, among others, than on policy issues like health care. And the congressional debate, as well as the paid advertisements on both sides, is centered on the substance of the law rather than its namesake, draining some of its toxicity on the right.As liberals overwhelm congressional town hall-style meetings and deluge the Capitol phone system with pleas to protect the health law, there is no similar clamor for dismantling it, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment. From deeply conservative districts in the South and the West to the more moderate parts of the Northeast, Republicans in Congress say there is significantly less intensity among opponents of the law than when Mr. Obama was in office.\u201cI hear more concerns than before about \u2018You\u2019re going to repeal it, and we\u2019re all going to lose insurance\u2019 because they don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to replace it,\u201d said Representative Mike Simpson, a Republican who represents a conservative district in Idaho.Since Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, about 20 million Americans have gained insurance because of it. And millions more who had pre-existing health conditions have been able to obtain coverage under the law. At the same time, many Americans have seen their premiums rise or their choices of insurance carriers dwindle.At least four recent polls show that public opinion on Obamacare is tipping in its favor.But it was not until now, with the Republicans taking control of the federal government, that the debate fully shifted from the theoretical to the tangible. It was easy for conservatives to rally against a law identified with a president they despised when he was capable of vetoing any repeal. Now that he is gone and the law\u2019s benefits appear to be on the chopping block, the people who stand to lose the most are the most vocal.\u201cI\u2019ve heard from constituents who have been harmed by the Affordable Care Act over the course of its being in existence,\u201d said Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, whose affluent district Mr. Trump narrowly lost last year. \u201cMore recently, because of our discussions on repairing it, I\u2019ve heard from those who do not wish to have the act amended. More recently, that is the preponderance of those who have contacted me.\u201dIt is a longstanding rule of politics that rallying opposition to a proposal is usually easier than galvanizing support. And never is this more the case than when a widely distributed benefit is at risk of being taken away.\u201cI was here in 2009 and 2010, and we\u2019re not getting the anti-Obamacare calls like that,\u201d said Representative Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who is on one of the committees tasked with rewriting the law. \u201cI think people are going to hold us accountable for making sure we not only repeal, but we have a law in place that creates a better opportunity for people.\u201dOverhauling the law, however, is far more politically complicated than simply scrapping it. Congressional Republican leaders were met with a backlash from their own ranks after it emerged that they were considering financing a new law by ending the longstanding practice of letting employers exclude from taxation the health benefits they offer.\u201cOur voters do expect action, but as you make changes you become vulnerable to attack,\u201d Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said. \u201cThis is fraught with difficulties, no doubt about it.\u201dAdding to the anxiety is Mr. Trump, who is a wild card on the health law. His health secretary, Tom Price, signaled to House Republicans at a private meeting on Thursday that the administration would let Congress draft a replacement bill, Mr. Cole said.But the president has said multiple times that he is uneasy about depriving anybody of health insurance, and he may bridle if Democrats attack any Republican plan that may lead to that.As Democrats note, Mr. Trump owes his victory in part to voters who have benefited from the law.\u201cA lot of economically vulnerable Republican voters have come to rely on government\u2019s involvement in making sure they have affordable health care,\u201dsaid Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.And with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers facing less pressure from the right than the left, conservative groups worry that the party will not ultimately have the stomach to repeal the law, which Republicans have been running against since 2010.\u201cVoters gave Republicans the charge to repeal and replace Obamacare, and the continued delays and discussions about repairing Obamacare need to stop,\u201d David McIntosh, the head of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group, said last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With No Frills and No Commissions, Robinhood App Takes On Big Brokerages", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the app\u2019s hype and surging popularity, some industry experts question if the free-trades business model can survive, or if it will wind up joining other start-ups that have crashed and burned. The company currently makes money primarily from interest on customer cash balances.At Robinhood, there is no minimum deposit to register an account, and there are no trading fees for customers who buy and sell United States-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. To keep costs down, the company, in Palo Alto, Calif., takes a no-frills approach. It has no storefront offices. It does not provide research reports, analytical tools, stock screening gizmos or options trading on its platform.\u201cUber opened our eyes that if you could hail a car off your phone and watch movies, why can\u2019t I trade 10 shares of Facebook or a thousand shares?\u201d said Howard Lindzon, a general partner of the Social Leverage Fund and a founder of StockTwits, a financial communications platform. His fund holds an equity stake in Robinhood.Chase Kaye, a 21-year-old Manhattan resident, signed up for Robinhood over a year ago after he grew tired of paying the $7 commission on trades at the Vanguard Group.\u201cThe interface on the phone app is way better,\u201d said Mr. Kaye, a marketing management student at Baruch College. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, not as intimidating and very intuitive.\u201d Today about 70 percent of his assets are with Robinhood, Mr. Kaye said.Still, nothing is truly free in the world of finance.Even the name conjures up images of a firm helping the poor, when it may actually be doing the opposite, he contends.Robinhood\u2019s founders dispute these concerns. Their goal is to make investing accessible to everyone, not just the superwealthy, which is why the name Robinhood was chosen, said Vladimir Tenev, 30, a founder.\u201cWe have active investors who are moving their trading over from other brokerages where they have paid thousands to tens of thousands of dollars in trading commissions,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. \u201cWe also have younger customers who are accumulating stocks and building mini diversified portfolios over time.\u201dA customer could buy one share in a stock or ETF today and five more shares next month to slowly build a portfolio. The fees at larger firms would make such a strategy cost prohibitive. Big brokerage firms like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, Fidelity and E-Trade typically charge $7 to $10 a trade.Robinhood\u2019s bare-bones business model has led to complaints about its customer service, with long waiting times by phone and emails that are not answered. Internet blogs are also filled with complaints about lengthy waits \u2014 up to eight days \u2014 to transfer money from a Robinhood account to a bank or vice versa. Mr. Tenev said the company was looking to solve these problems.And some customers are frustrated that the company doesn\u2019t offer options trading, a website trading platform or automated transfers from other brokerage accounts. Mr. Tenev said that would change. \u201cIf you look down several years, we\u2019ll offer all of these things,\u201d he said.Robinhood is the brainchild of Mr. Tenev and Baiju Prafulkumar Bhatt, Stanford graduates who shared a passion for math and physics. In 2009 they moved to New York, where they began Celeris and Chronos Research, which made high-frequency trading software for hedge funds and banks.Inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, they rethought their priorities. \u201cThe financial services industry should serve all people, regardless of net worth,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. In 2012, they moved back to California, hired engineers and spent the next 18 months building Robinhood.In late 2013, Robinhood set up a beta version and invited people to test the app. When the sign-up page was posted on Hacker News and Reddit, the site was flooded with requests.\u201cWe had almost 50,000 people that signed up that first weekend,\u201d Mr. Bhatt, 32, recalled. By the time the app began in the App Store in late 2014, it had a wait-list of a million people, most under the age of 30.The company has raised $66 million in start-up cash from such high-flying investors as Andreessen Horowitz, GV, Index Ventures and New Enterprise Associates, as well as entertainers like Jared Leto, Snoop Dogg and Nas.In addition to cash balances, the company makes money from \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d which refers to the money it receives for selling its orders to market makers to be executed.\u201cThese revenue streams alone are not enough to sustain an online broker providing $0 trades \u2014 not even close,\u201d said Blain Reinkensmeyer, the head of broker research at StockBrokers.com.Recently, Robinhood introduced a Gold program, which offers margin accounts and after-hours trading, for a fee.\u201cRobinhood Gold is where we anticipate the bulk of the revenues to come from in the future,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. Robinhood charges Gold accounts a fixed monthly fee that works out to 5 to 6 percent interest on margin accounts, whether the customer uses the credit line or not. At larger firms, like Schwab, customers are charged interest only on the margin amount that\u2019s used.\u201cI got the email to sign up for a free month trial of their new Gold account, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in,\u201d Mr. Kaye said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably stay with Vanguard for margin accounts.\u201dAnother firm, Zecco, attempted a similar \u201cfree trades\u201d model in 2006. Despite raising more than $35 million in financing, the company struggled to get off the ground, and eventually merged with TradeKing in 2012. It now charges $4.95 a trade.\u201cZecco couldn\u2019t find a path to profitability without charging for commissions and evolving into a traditional online broker,\u201d Mr. Reinkensmeyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly history is forgotten.\u201dMr. Lindzon, the Robinhood equity investor, noted that Zecco operated when smartphone use was in its infancy.\u201cWith a couple billion people now on smartphones, it\u2019s a very different market today,\u201d said Aaron Levie, a founder of the cloud company Box, and another of Robinhood\u2019s equity investors.Other start-ups have entered the territory to challenge Robinhood. They include Ustocktrade, which charges a $1-a-month membership fee and offers $1 trades, and Loyal3, which offers no-fee trades on a limited number of stocks, partial shares and initial public offerings. There\u2019s also Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Edge, which offers 30 free stock and ETF trades each month for customers with a balance of at least $50,000 and 100 free trades a month on balances of at least $100,000.So far, the big brokerage firms do not appear concerned about Robinhood. Kim Hillyer, a spokesman for TDAmeritrade, said investors value a full-service firm that offers free education, webinars, research tools and investment consultants in addition to a full trading platform that includes futures and options. She noted that TDAmeritrade accounts have continued to grow since Robinhood\u2019s introduction, rising to seven million in fiscal 2016 from 6.3 million in 2014. \u201cThe growth in new accounts is a validation for the value proposition that we have,\u201d she said.Erin Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Schwab, agreed. \u201cWe know that investors and traders alike are looking for value from their brokerage firms, and our clients find that here,\u201d she said. The firm\u2019s investment services and products include financial planning and research as well as a full trading platform and commission-free ETFs.Still, the two firms said they are always looking for ways to stay competitive, and sometimes offer low-fee and no-fee trading promotions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oscar-Nominated Movies, Sometimes Streaming Near You", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingOne common complaint about the Oscars addresses the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 perceived tendency to honor movies that ostensibly no one has seen. In some cases, the complainants are talking about prestige films that didn\u2019t do a lot at the box office. A couple of months ago, I was listening to a podcast featuring two of the West Coast\u2019s more colorful Oscar commentators, and one of them excitedly put \u201cLa La Land\u201d in the category of films no one has seen. At the time, the movie, a critical favorite among festivalgoers, had not yet been released. Oscar commentators can be very silly people.\u201cLa La Land\u201d has since gone into something like wide release \u2014 it\u2019s in about 2,000 theaters, about half the number that super-wide releases will be in at the height of their glory \u2014 and is doing well enough that you can say some people have seen it, and now that it has garnered 14 Oscar nominations, more people will.This year, streaming video services are beginning to change how Oscar-nominated movies are seen, for one very simple reason: These services are financing, producing and distributing movies they hope will win Oscars. \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d distributed by Amazon Studios, landed six nominations, including for best picture. While it\u2019s still playing in theaters (a little over 500, as of this writing), it will hit video on demand and be available for download for a fee from Amazon and other services, including FandangoNow, in early February. It will start streaming on Amazon in May, when it will be free for Prime members.Right now, one of the five nominees for best documentary, Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201c13th,\u201d is on Netflix, the company that produced the movie. One of this year\u2019s other best documentary nominees, \u201cO.J.: Made in America,\u201d in fact, aired as a television mini-series after a brief theatrical qualifying run, and has been available on demand since it first ran on ESPN.Of the other nominees for best picture besides \u201cManchester,\u201d only the crime thriller \u201cHell or High Water\u201d (which also drew a best supporting actor nod for Jeff Bridges and an original screenplay one for Taylor Sheridan) can be seen on YouTube, Amazon Video, iTunes, Vudu and Google Play at prices from $2.99 to $14.99 depending on the rent-buy option you choose. Viggo Mortensen\u2019s nominated leading-man turn in the hippie-family tear-jerker \u201cCaptain Fantastic\u201d can also be viewed via those services. So, too, can one of the more distinctive of the best animated feature nominees, \u201cKubo and the Two Strings.\u201dMeryl Streep in the title role of the tragicomic biopic \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d can be seen via all the same services save Amazon. Another best actress nominee, Ruth Negga, was recognized for her work in the fact-based civil rights drama \u201cLoving\u201d; that picture can be seen for a fee on Vudu, Amazon and iTunes. Michael Shannon was considered a surprise in the best supporting actor category for his work in \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d; the movie is not coming to streaming as such, but it will debut on demand on Feb. 21, the same day the Blu-ray and DVD package, which includes access to a digital download, comes out.I was actually a little surprised, looking at the home pages of several streaming services on Tuesday, when the nominations were announced, to not see much in the way of Oscar promotion. However many viewers tune in on the big night or not, the Oscars are an arguably potent form of clickbait, and even if major nominated films haven\u2019t made it to streaming yet, the services themselves teem with work by the nominees.The Greek cinematic provocateur Yorgos Lanthimos earned a screenplay nomination for \u201cThe Lobster\u201d (available on Amazon Video); his discomfiting earlier features \u201cDogtooth\u201d and \u201cAlps\u201d are on Fandor, a conscientious cinephile site that gives Amazon Prime users a free trial. \u201cMedicine for Melancholy,\u201d the first feature by Barry Jenkins, whose haunting \u201cMoonlight\u201d garnered eight nominations, including best picture and director, is on iTunes and Amazon. Given that \u201cMoonlight\u201d is just Mr. Jenkins\u2019s second feature, there\u2019s not much of a remove between the films.Similarly, one can view all of the previous features of Damien Chazelle, the director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d via Amazon Prime. Fandor has his \u201cGuy and Madeline on a Park Bench\u201d (2009), while Prime carries \u201cWhiplash\u201d (2014). For good measure, on Amazon there\u2019s also another music-themed picture for which Chazelle wrote the screenplay, the 2013 novelty thriller \u201cGrand Piano.\u201d (Amazon has \u201cThe Last Exorcism 2,\u201d which was partly written by Mr. Chazelle; he is also one of five credited screenwriters on the more respectable horror movie \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d for rent or purchase on major sites.)Finally, a warning: Be on the lookout for purveyors of pirated content who piggyback on legitimate services like Vimeo. For example, in my searches I came across results saying the animated film \u201cTrolls\u201d (yes, it has an Oscar nominee for best song: Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling!\u201d) and \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d were streaming in full on the aforementioned site. But they are not. (And \u201cAnimals\u201d has since been removed.) Once you hit play and the studio logo comes up, you are asked to \u201cregister\u201d and log in with a separate \u201cservice.\u201d I declined to do this, and I would advise you to do the same.An earlier version of this article misstated the format in which \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d will be released in February. It will be available for download for a fee. It will not begin streaming until May on Amazon. The article also misstated the date that \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d will debut on demand. It is Feb. 21, not earlier in the month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Campaign to Repeal Obamacare Stalls on the Details", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress\u2019s rush to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, once seemingly unstoppable, is flagging badly as Republicans struggle to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition.\u201cIt is more accurate to say \u2018repair Obamacare,\u2019\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said this week. \u201cWe can repair the individual market, and that is a good place to start.\u201dThe struggles and false starts have injected more uncertainty into insurance markets that thrive on stability. An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees\u2019 lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers.Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act\u2019s market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not?\u201cWe need some certainty around the rules,\u201d said Dr. J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, which has been a stalwart in the Affordable Care Act market and is making money under the system.\u201cWe have a few months, but we don\u2019t have a lot of time,\u201d he said.At their annual retreat last week, in Philadelphia, several congressional Republicans edged away from their powerful promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act. It would, they said, be more accurate to say they intend to fix a law that they blame for the cancellation of many insurance policies, soaring premiums and a shrinking choice of health plans in many states.Many Republicans say their resolve to dismantle the law, a central element of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, is undiminished. \u201cWe are looking to repeal this law, just like we told the voters we were going to do, just like we promised them we would do,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a leader of the House\u2019s most conservative wing. \u201cAfter all, there was an election where that was one of the most important issues.\u201dBut after waging and winning many elections with a promise to kill it, Republicans still have no agreement on how to replace it. They will, they say, pursue a piecemeal approach because they have no desire to supplant the giant 2010 health law with a single comprehensive Republican plan cooked up in Washington.When Congress convened this year, Republicans immediately introduced a budget resolution clearing the way for legislation to gut the health law, with strong support from Mr. Trump, who took office 17 days later. But Mr. Trump\u2019s rocky start has slowed the momentum, depleting his political capital and dimming prospects for bipartisan cooperation.In addition, many senators are preoccupied with fights over the confirmation of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to the Supreme Court and top jobs in his administration. What was once considered Congress\u2019s Job No. 1 is being eclipsed for some lawmakers by more immediate matters.Insurers say Republicans\u2019 mixed messages and slowing pace could send premiums soaring next year while making the market much less stable. The deadline to file rates for 2018 is this spring, and insurers say they need time to decide what kinds of plans to offer and to set prices.At least four recent polls show that public opinion on Obamacare is tipping in its favor.\u201cWe need stability and predictability,\u201d said Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobby for the industry.Unless Congress continues cost-sharing subsidies, to reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income people, and a reinsurance program, to help pay large claims, she said, more insurers will pull out of the market.Insurers are also concerned about signs that the Trump administration may not enforce the so-called individual mandate, which requires people to have insurance or face a tax penalty. The penalty, or some way to encourage more participation, is seen as central to having enough young and healthy people sign up to keep premiums low.\u201cIt\u2019s very important to indicate how they are going to stabilize the market,\u201d said Karen M. Ignagni, the chief executive of EmblemHealth, who was instrumental in the development of the current law.At the very least, analysts say the uncertainty for insurers could lead to much higher rates. \u201c2018 is a wild card,\u201d said Deep Banerjee, who follows insurers for Standard & Poor\u2019s.The end game is perhaps predictable. In the Senate, Republicans will need help from Democrats to replace the health law because they hold 52 seats but will need 60 votes. Several Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee, say they will not vote to repeal the law unless they have a clear picture of what will replace it. And Democrats will not support any replacement unless Republicans scrap the idea of an outright repeal, which conservatives have been demanding for years.\u201cWe can\u2019t repair the roof while Republicans and the president are burning the house down,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.Republicans have many ideas about how to shore up insurance markets and lower costs. But it is highly unlikely that any of their proposals would be found by the Congressional Budget Office to insure as many people as the Affordable Care Act. Downbeat assessments from the budget office have doomed many proposals in the past, including the health care plan devised by Bill and Hillary Clinton in 1993.Mr. Trump chose Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, to be his secretary of health and human services, with the expectation that he would work closely with Republicans in Congress on the details of a replacement plan. Democrats have delayed his confirmation, and that in turn has delayed Republican efforts to devise an alternative to the health care law they detest.Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee voted on Wednesday to recommend confirmation of Mr. Price, overriding objections by Democrats, who boycotted the proceedings.All of that turmoil in Washington has left insurers scrambling.\u201cWhile the direction in Washington has been positive, we still need certainty about short-term fixes in order to determine the extent of our participation,\u201d Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers and a major player in the market, told investors on Wednesday.Anthem said it expected to break even or make money selling individual coverage this year but said the market continued not to work as well as it could.\u201cWe have weighed in considerably, and continue to do so, with all the leadership in Congress,\u201d Mr. Swedish said.Advertisement"}

Shutters are missing, and stairs are crumbling. There are holes in the sides of the dormer windows, and cats and squirrels roam in and out of the basement, leaving behind an unseemly smell.\u201cThe peeling paint looks like tears, like the building is crying, \u2018Help me,\u2019\u201d said Charles Young, the president of the Erasmus Hall High School Alumni Association.Preservationists are using the fact that Hamilton is enjoying a surge in popularity because of the Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d as a way to pressure the city to save the building from further decay. Hamilton and his contemporaries \u201cput that money up because they cared enough about education,\u201d said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a preservationist group. \u201cIt would be a wonderful history lesson to save the building now. The building is an important part of the city\u2019s heritage, so what kind of history lesson is the city teaching its students if the building is not maintained?\u201dEric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, has pledged to provide financing for restoration and said the city could capitalize on the building\u2019s connection to Hamilton. \u201cWe could be using the building as a learning tool to teach history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to use our imagination and realize there\u2019s more than one way to teach history \u2014 look at how \u2018Hamilton\u2019 opened the eyes of young people and got them talking about history.\u201dOver time, the building has become a \u201cdumping ground,\u201d Mr. Young said, filled with ladders, lamps, old art projects, yearbooks, historical photos and even transcripts from the 1940s. \u201cThis is demolition by neglect,\u201d Mr. Young said, adding that the building\u2019s courtyard location, hidden from public view, hurts its cause. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see it, so they don\u2019t think about it.\u201dMs. Breen estimated that it would cost $1.7 million to $2 million to repair the building, with damaged dormer walls and missing weatherproofing being the most pressing issues.But officials at the city\u2019s Department of Education say the building, which has landmark status from the city\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission, is not suitable for classroom space, so the agency is unwilling to spend money to restore it. Still, Toya Holness, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the agency was \u201clooking into appropriate uses for the building that preserve its history.\u201d Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the city also would not commit any financing \u201cwithout any public purpose for the building.\u201dMs. Breen argued that there were plenty of potential nonclassroom uses: school offices, teachers\u2019 lounges or after-school programs. Dr. Mathieu Eugene, a city councilman who represents the neighborhood, said putting school offices in the building could open space for classrooms elsewhere on the Erasmus campus, which has 1,990 students.When it was founded, Erasmus Hall Academy housed not just classrooms but the high school students themselves \u2014 the original 26 students lived in the building. The school flourished for decades, but enrollment started falling after Brooklyn started its own public school system. In 1896, the building was donated to Brooklyn for a public school.Brooklyn\u2019s rapid growth led to the construction in sections, from 1905 to 1940, of the ornate and sprawling Collegiate Gothic campus that now surrounds the academy. Erasmus alumni include the singer Barbra Streisand, the actor Eli Wallach, authors like Bernard Malamud and Mickey Spillane, the music industry legend Clive Davis, the opera singer Beverly Sills, and Al Davis, a former owner of the Oakland Raiders football team.In the 20th century, the academy building became a principal\u2019s office, the guidance office and, for a time, a local-history museum that recreated 18th-century life for elementary schools to visit.\u201cIt was an administration building when I was there,\u201d said Wilhelmina Rhodes-Kelly, another member of the alumni association, who graduated in 1964.Mr. Young, who graduated in 1975 and is now a dean at the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology in Bay Ridge, said, \u201cWhen I was there, you went in to research colleges.\u201dAfter the building was closed, numerous efforts to find new uses were rebuffed by the Education Department, Ms. Breen said.

{"Headline": "Republicans Agree on Cutting Taxes, but Not on How to Do It", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "Republicans control the White House and Congress, and remain united in their desire to change the tax code. But they are far from united in how to achieve that goal.Supported byFor anyone who thinks that Republican control of the presidency, the Senate and the House of Representatives means that an overhaul of the tax code will zip through at bobsled speed, there is an important phrase to remember:\u201cBlah, blah, blah, blah.\u201dThat was the reaction of the Republican speaker of the House, John A. Boehner of Ohio, in 2014 to a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code proposed by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee \u2014 and a member of his own party.\u201cJust because there\u2019s an \u2018R\u2019 in the White House, an \u2018R\u2019 in the House and an \u2018R\u2019 in the Senate doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re from the same alphabet,\u201d said Douglas Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae.But several Republicans have misgivings about specific provisions, not to mention the cost. As for the White House, the most predictable response is unpredictability.As it turns out, Republicans at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and in the House are not that far apart when it comes to the individual side of the tax code. They agree on the goal of lowering income tax rates for everybody. The House blueprint reduces the number of brackets to three from seven and drops the top rate on the highest incomes to 33 percent from 39.6 percent. The middle range rate would be 25 percent and the lower rate, 12 percent.Taxes on capital gains (which tend to affect higher-income households the most) would be slashed, and the alternative minimum tax, devised to limit the use of loopholes, would be eliminated. The estate tax, which affects the top 0.2 percent sliver of households, would disappear, as would most itemized deductions, including one that allows the deduction of state and local taxes \u2014 dear to anyone who lives where there is a state or city income tax.But bigger standard deductions would take away much of the sting, reducing the incentives for most taxpayers to itemize at all. (Instead of 30 percent, just 5 percent would still find it worth their while.) During his campaign, President Trump talked about capping deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations, but the House plan promises to retain them (with vague references to making them more efficient). Given how popular these two costly deductions are, however, there is not much appetite in Congress for going after them.Other proposals, like tax credits for children, have also been widely embraced.\u201cThree-quarters of the tax cuts would benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers,\u201d the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said of the House plan. The highest-income households \u2014 the top 0.1 percent \u2014 would get \u201can average tax cut of about $1.3 million, 16.9 percent of after-tax income.\u201d By contrast, those in the middle fifth of incomes would get a 0.5 percent tax cut, worth about $260.Such problems are trifles when compared with divisions caused by proposed alterations to corporate and business taxes.On Friday, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and a Republican from Kentucky, announced that Congress would move ahead on health care and tax reform without the Democrats.That is not a surprising decision these days, when \u201cbipartisanship\u201d has turned into a punch line and party-line voting has become the rule rather than the exception. Still, this strategy has risks .Laws that lack a single vote from the opposition party are by nature more controversial, unstable and vulnerable to political attack: The Affordable Care Act was passed that way. And when the budget is involved, bills passed with slim majorities can be subject to time limits. (When you hear Washington insiders talking about \u201cbudget reconciliation,\u201d that\u2019s part of what they are referring to.)Although Republicans unilaterally pushed through personal tax cuts when they controlled Congress in the past, the majority\u2019s fast-track weapon has never been used with comprehensive tax reform. Tax provisions can dictate many businesses\u2019 long-term planning and investment decisions, and no one wants to restructure his or her operation only to find that the rule book will be thrown away in a decade.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of proposals floating around, and it\u2019s clear there are going to be some winners and losers,\u201d said Ken Esch, a partner at the consulting and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cMany companies are struggling to figure if they\u2019re going to be a winner or a loser.\u201dThat red ink will irk Republican deficit hawks.\u201cIf we don\u2019t get any Democrats on board, we\u2019ll basically need universal Republican support to pass anything,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cThat means the Senate will have to work through its own tax reform process if we\u2019re going to have any chance of succeeding.\u201dSeveral Democrats \u2014 most important, the Senate\u2019s minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 also want to lower corporate tax rates from their current 35 percent. (They would demand concessions in return, potentially putting other treasured Republican proposals at risk.)With each passing day, partisan rancor has ratcheted up, including in the Finance Committee. When the Democrats boycotted a committee hearing on Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Hatch suspended the rule that required a least one member of the minority party to be in attendance. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they want at this point,\u201d Mr. Hatch said, calling the Democrats \u201cidiots.\u201dIgnoring Democrats still doesn\u2019t patch up the divisions among Republicans. Mr. Hatch also told the Chamber of Commerce that \u201cno one should expect the Senate to simply take up and pass a House tax reform bill,\u201d signaling to Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady that their blueprint was unlikely to emerge intact.In regard to lackluster economic growth, a crippling national debt and many other problems, Mr. Hatch told the chamber, \u201cI certainly don\u2019t believe they can all be fixed by a single party or president.\u201dThe veteran Republican\u2019s warning, however, is unlikely to stop the Republicans from trying.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Will Meet With Federal Prosecutors on Friday", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEnding months of anticipation and speculation, Mayor Bill de Blasio will meet on Friday with federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents who have been investigating the mayor\u2019s campaign fund-raising for nearly a year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.A grand jury has heard evidence in the case, some of the people have said, but it remains unclear whether the investigation, focused on whether the mayor or others in his administration traded beneficial city action for donations to his 2013 election campaign or to his now-defunct nonprofit political group \u2014 or both \u2014 will result in charges. Either way, the interview is an indication that the expansive criminal inquiry is most likely in its final stages.In recent weeks, investigators appear to have focused on a relatively new area in the inquiry, looking into the mayor\u2019s relationship with a Brooklyn businessman who hosted a fund-raiser for him in October 2013, after the Democratic primary but before the general election, according to two of the people. Like others interviewed for this article, they declined to comment because they were not authorized to discuss the continuing investigation.Mayor de Blasio has repeatedly defended his fund-raising practices and his conduct over all, along with that of his aides and his campaign staff. Although he has declined to answer specific questions from reporters about the investigation and the particular matters under scrutiny, he has said that he and his administration have been cooperating with the prosecutors, who are from the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara.\u201cWe are absolutely confident that the mayor and our City Hall staff have acted appropriately and well within the law at all times,\u201d Eric F. Phillips, a spokesman for the mayor, said Thursday.A spokesman for Mr. Bharara\u2019s office declined to comment about the meeting or the investigation, as did a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The mayor is expected to be questioned on Friday morning in a conference room at Kramer Levin\u2019s offices in Midtown Manhattan, according to the people with knowledge of the planned session, which they said is expected to last about four hours. The prosecutors and agents want to question the mayor about more than a dozen topics.Mr. Singh is the former owner of the Water\u2019s Edge, a popular restaurant and wedding venue on waterfront property in Long Island City, Queens, that is owned by the city. In 2014 and 2015, Mr. Singh, who was having financial difficulties, was negotiating a new lease with the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which handles such matters.A person briefed on the matter said that emails from 2014 and 2015, including several between officials in City Hall and the agency\u2019s commissioner at the time, Stacy Cumberbatch, and her senior staff, suggest that the mayor took a keen interest in the process. The person said city officials eventually took over the negotiations because they were unhappy with how Ms. Cumberbatch handled the talks.In one email with the subject line, \u201cHeads Up re: Harendra Singh,\u201d according to the person, an aide to the mayor told the commissioner in June 2014 that \u201cthe mayor would like you to meet with Harendra asap since it is a time sensitive issue that he has,\u201d apparently referring to the lease negotiations.In another email sent later that day, the aide added: \u201cOne other note for this is the mayor wants a briefing from you on this before the meeting between you and Harendra takes place. Thank you!\u201dBefore the negotiations were completed, Mr. Singh was arrested on unrelated federal fraud and bribery charges brought by prosecutors in Brooklyn in September 2015. He is now cooperating in the fund-raising inquiry.After the interview, Mr. de Blasio is expected to fly to Atlanta to attend the Democratic National Committee winter meeting, where a new chairman is to be elected on Saturday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Venture Capitalist\u2019s Misguided Critique of a Trump Adviser", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorChief among Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s errors, according to Mr. Moritz, was the use of the carried-interest tax. Under this tax treatment, top executives in both private equity and venture capital pay lower capital gains taxes, instead of higher income taxes \u2014 \u201can indefensible quirk in the United States tax code,\u201d Mr. Moritz wrote.Private equity firms also regularly borrow money to buy companies, and deduct the interest paid on that debt. For good measure, Mr. Moritz cast aspersions on that business model, portraying private equity as wreckers of companies and job destroyers as well as a \u201csymbol\u201d for \u201ceconomic inequality.\u201dAnd then he tied it all to Mr. Trump, throwing in a line that the relationship between Mr. Schwarzman and the president resembled a scene from \u201cGoodfellas.\u201dThe Op-Ed article was so over the top in its attacks on Mr. Schwarzman and private equity that it obscured some very valid points.Carried interest was in the cross hairs for elimination under the Obama administration and has drawn complaints from many, including Mr. Trump, as giving an undue tax break to wealthy private equity and venture capital fund managers.Still, all of these issues are up for debate, and one has to wonder why Mr. Moritz appeared to get so personal in his opinion article.A spokesman for Sequoia said, \u201cMichael\u2019s views are strictly personal and not those of Sequoia Capital.\u201d Mr. Moritz declined to comment for this column.But perhaps it\u2019s a sign that increasingly, all is not completely rosy in the world of alternative investment funds, private equity and venture capital among them.The worst off are the funds not mentioned by Mr. Moritz: hedge funds. Buffeted by years of declining returns and poor performance, the $3 trillion hedge fund industry may be peaking.The Trump administration, with its vow to crank up infrastructure spending and reinflate the economy, could improve the picture on returns. Tax and regulatory changes could also help. Still, a number of large investors, including public pension funds, are growing skeptical about the hedge fund model.If hedge funds are in the most precarious position, private equity funds are also facing doubts. The funds continue to raise billions of dollars, but their share of public buyouts has fallen. Private equity constituted less than 3 percent of public buyouts in 2016, according to Dealogic.While private equity returns have been great in the past, it is unclear if they can be sustained, with some market analysts seeing stock prices as too high. And a majority of sales of companies owned by private equity funds are simply to other private equity firms, according to Pitchbook.With the industry facing challenges in the market, the loss of carried-interest tax and the debt tax deduction would be huge blows, lowering returns.All is not so great in venture capital either. Bill Gates has called the returns of venture capital funds \u201cpathetic.\u201dSure, some of the biggest funds have enjoyed very healthy returns, but those have been juiced by the $1 billion club of hot start-ups known as \u201cunicorns.\u201d And their valuations are big questions.The coming initial public offering of the messaging service Snap could well revive investor demand for unicorns. Or it may not. In any case, the competition in technology investing is intensifying.There are other challenges facing venture capital: Near-zero interest rates are like gasoline on venture capital investments. If interest rates go up, valuations may fall rapidly. Venture capital partners will also lose if the carried-interest deduction is eliminated.Mr. Moritz\u2019s criticism of private equity can be seen as an effort to make venture capital look better \u2014 better for investors and the country. It\u2019s easy to see why. Private equity will increasingly become a competitor \u2014 for tech investors and investors\u2019 dollars.In other words, there will be shakeout among all funds, a disruption that will hit private equity, venture capital and all other funds.How else to explain such a diatribe?Here is a man who points the finger at private equity for fostering income inequality, while ignoring venture capital\u2019s own role in perpetuating it. Sequoia Capital, for example, is a big investor in Airbnb, an alternative to hotels and their employees, who are often in union jobs. Sequoia is also an investor in self-driving technology that is sure to wreak havoc with taxi jobs and the one million truck drivers across the country.In these politically divided times, heated statements seem to be everywhere, drowning out more rational arguments. That Mr. Moritz would feel the need to join this crowd is disappointing. Perhaps he should instead focus on his own business, as changes may be coming to venture capital, as well as to his private equity brethren.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Who Are the Richest of the Rich?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isn\u2019t a lot of money in 1997.Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, \u201cO.K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion.\u201dTwenty years after the movie \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d was released, billions of dollars aren\u2019t what they used to be, either.Bill Gates alone is just $10 billion shy of Dr. Evil\u2019s ransom demand, according to a list of the world\u2019s top 10 billionaires compiled by Wealth-X, a financial research firm. Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, tops the list at $89.3 billion, followed by his friend Warren Buffett at $73.5 billion.The top 10 \u2014 nine from the United States, one from Spain \u2014 have a combined net worth of $582 billion. While their wealth would certainly be enough to save the world from Dr. Evil, what they do with it in real life is the subject of great interest and debate.That is true now more than ever. Issues around money \u2014 like wealth inequality and talk of tax cuts for the rich \u2014 are among the hottest topics of the day. And the richest president in history is sitting in the Oval Office, with billionaires sprinkled throughout his cabinet.To some, today\u2019s billionaires are like Dr. Evil: selfish, rapacious and bent on world domination. To others, billionaires are worthy of respect for having put their names and fortunes behind an array of philanthropic endeavors, many aimed at improving the lives of people at the very base of the wealth pyramid.There were 2,473 billionaires in the world, as of Wealth-X\u2019s last count through 2015. That was a 6.4 percent increase in billionaires from the year before.But who these billionaires are and what they\u2019re like is more difficult to discern. Many may seem as ordinary as the guy sitting next to you on the train \u2014 or in Michael Bloomberg\u2019s case, standing beside you on the subway, when he was mayor of New York. (Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on Wealth-X\u2019s list.)There are certainly billionaires who want to save the world, like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bloomberg, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. Others in the top 10 are also philanthropic, but they are still focusing on their day jobs, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Alphabet (the parent of Google) \u2014 Nos. 4, 5 and 10.Yet many of the billionaires beyond the top 10 or 20 have a much lower profile. Who outside of finance or hockey knew of Vincent Viola, a former oil trader and current owner of the Florida Panthers, before President Trump nominated him to be secretary of the Army? Now that he has withdrawn, he can return to relative anonymity.For that matter, Wilbur L. Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, is the wealthiest of the president\u2019s billionaire cabinet picks. He would pop up in the headlines every few years for a deal he was making but then return to what could be called the quiet opulence of the billionaire class.\u201cThey\u2019re different in how they can invest their assets and what their portfolio may look like,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said. \u201cIn many ways, they face different risks, both personal risks and cyber risks, than the average individual does. They often think about structuring decisions differently from a succession-planning standpoint as well as the structure they create around themselves and their family.\u201dYet for most people, billionaires are just wealthy beyond belief. And these days, they are also much wealthier (and getting even more so) than the broader ultra-high-net-worth population.That group is defined as anyone with more than $30 million. In 2015, there were 212,615 of them. On the lower end, the 155,050 people worth between $30 million and $99 million had a combined $8.4 trillion. At the top, the world\u2019s 2,473 billionaires were worth $7.68 trillion.\u201cThere is growing inequality around the world, but there is also inequality among the ultrawealthy,\u201d said Maya Imberg, director of custom research at Wealth-X.Billionaires also matter because of the outsize influence they have, or believe they can have, on policy and public life. They can give millions to a political campaign, as Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, did with Mr. Trump, or as George Soros, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has done with liberal causes.But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group. How they amassed their billions, and how that pile is growing, tells a lot about the economy today.Just as the best teacher in the country is going to earn less money than a mediocre investment banker, the industries in which future billionaires begin their careers determine the magnitude of their wealth and how quickly it is going to grow.Six of the top 10 billionaires made their money in technology. But in Wealth-X\u2019s research, technology ranks sixth overall for the number of billionaires on the list, with 114 around the world.Finance has created the most billionaires, with 377, or 15 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires. It is followed by industrial conglomerates, with 317, or 13 percent.After that, the concentration in particular industries drops. Real estate is third with 141. The group of people who identify their industry as nonprofits (meaning they made their money some other way or inherited it) is fourth, with 122. Manufacturing, in fifth place, has 120.\u201cGlobalization has been a big trend,\u201d said Benjamin Kinnard, a research analyst at Wealth-X. \u201cThe market is now seven billion people, not just the size of your domestic country.\u201dHe added that finance had a bigger lead in first place several years ago, but it has been losing ground as industries like technology boom.A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other people\u2019s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified.The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance.And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts).While the number of billionaires in China is rising at a fast clip, the pace of growth in billionaires worldwide is slowing. Wealth-X said the number will be 3,250 by 2020, down 16 percent from an earlier prediction of 3,873. This is because economic growth is expected to slow around the world.Across the billionaire spectrum, the biggest proportion of billionaires\u2019 wealth \u2014 about half \u2014 is in the business that created the wealth in the first place, according to Wealth-X\u2019s research. After that, they have about a quarter of their money in public securities and a little less than a quarter in cash. Just 4 percent is in real estate and luxury assets, the research found.There are common strains to how they cross the billionaire line, regardless of industry: 57 percent are self-made, according to Wealth-X, and another 31 percent received an inheritance and grew it into billions.\u201cTiming has a lot to do with it,\u201d said John Mathews, head of private wealth management and the ultra-high-net-worth group at UBS. \u201cIf we looked back 100 years, it would have been a really great time to be in steel, railroad or infrastructure businesses. Today, it\u2019s a good time to be in technology and finance.\u201dBut there is a difference from the bottom of the billionaire ladder to the top: Most are on that first rung.Over half of all billionaires are worth between $1 billion and $2 billion. Go up to $5 billion and there are 2,101.And not all billionaires are household names.Ma Jianrong, executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group Holdings, which is the leading textile company in China and manufactures clothing for Nike, Adidas, Puma and Uniqlo, is worth $4.3 billion.Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, built his wealth through mining in South Africa after starting his career as a lawyer in the United States. He is now worth $2.1 billion.Kevin Systrom, chief executive of Instagram, is surely well known in Silicon Valley \u2014 and among students at Stanford University (his alma mater) who want to emulate his route to a net worth of $1.2 billion by age 33. But he is not as recognizable as Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook.But being a billionaire, as opposed to a very wealthy millionaire, can make a huge difference in the loss of privacy for a family. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to be anonymous,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said.And being known as billionaires opens them up to risks, she said, like cybersecurity breaches and attacks on their families.How single-digit billionaires add additional billions isn\u2019t always up to them.One way to become even wealthier is to have picked the right global industry in which to make your billions and hang on to your stake in your company as it booms \u2014 and avoids busts. Right now, the technology and finance industries are leading the growth. Another way is to make your money in the right region, which is Asia.Then, of course, there are the investment opportunities that only get presented to the wealthiest people, and that only they have the resources to take a chance on. \u201cThey can diversify their holdings to protect themselves,\u201d Mr. Kinnard said.And the big investments that are needed in private equity deals, for example, are a smaller portion of overall wealth for billionaires than for someone with, say, $100 million.\u201cThe common thread with billionaires is the incredibly focused drive these people have in whatever business they go into,\u201d Mr. Mathews said. \u201cIt\u2019s dogged determination. You can say everyone is like that, but with billionaires everything else gets blocked out. You see it today with tech the way you saw it with steel barons 100 years ago.\u201dYet getting across the billionaire line does not mean a person will always be there.\u201cOnce a billionaire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stay a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Mathews of UBS said. \u201cLast year alone there were 41 new billionaires created in the United States, but 36 also dropped out of billionaire status in the U.S. Our billionaire population is growing but only by a net of five.\u201dIn the United States, Mr. Mathews said, most people fall off the billionaire list because they sell the company that created their wealth. \u201cWhen you sell it, there are tax issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are estate-planning issues.\u201dThe latter results in chunks of money being given to heirs to get it out of the wealth creator\u2019s estate.Selling family firms happens less often in Europe and Asia. People end up holding on to them and creating family holding companies to continue to operate that original business and expand into others.Of course, people who sell their $1 billion company and end up with $500 million after taxes \u2014 or whose wealth tops out at $800 million \u2014 aren\u2019t scraping by. But being a billionaire gives you entry into an exclusive club that being a millionaire does not. After all, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s wealth from his career at Exxon Mobil looks positively modest. He\u2019s worth just a few hundred million.What is expected of people who have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes? It depends on whom you ask.\u201cIt is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when one in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day,\u201d Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam, said in a statement. \u201cInequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty. It is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.\u201dYet the anger against the superrich has abated since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Protesters seem to be more concerned with the actions of Mr. Trump (who is likely a billionaire, although he has provided little proof of his real wealth) than with his cabinet of plutocrats.Philanthropy has become important to many billionaires, and not just through the Giving Pledge, Mr. Buffett\u2019s compact to get the wealthiest to give away at least half of their fortunes. Nor is it confined to the United States, with its tradition of charitable giving.\u201cWhen I explained to him that New York City\u2019s annual school budget was $22 billion a year,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, \u201cthat was the last time we ever heard from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The contract would then have to be resubmitted to his office for consideration.\u201cWe are seeking additional information on this contract from the N.Y.P.D. and it will not be registered at this time,\u201d said Tyrone Stevens, a spokesman for Mr. Stringer.But the planning between the city and a vendor for a pilot program cannot normally begin until a contract is registered. That the body-camera contract would have to be refiled with the comptroller added a delay to a program that had already been redesigned once by the federal monitor and has yet to be rolled out on the streets.Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor, said the procurement process had been \u201crigorous and extensive\u201d and that it was \u201cbaffling that anybody would stand in the way of greater transparency and the deployment of these important policing tools.\u201dThe Police Department has around 36,000 uniformed members, though not all work in a patrol function. It was not immediately clear how many would wear body cameras under the mayor\u2019s proposal.Mr. de Blasio said on Friday he was confident the Police Department and the city could quickly expand the program from an initial group of 1,000 officers, to roughly 5,000 and then to the whole patrol force.Mr. Finan said that \u201cthe comptroller will not slow down our commitment.\u201dUnder the City Charter, the comptroller can reject a contract only for specific reasons, such as evidence of possible corruption, a lack of financing to pay for the contract, or an absence of certification from the mayor and Law Department that the contract was legal and proper.Mr. Stevens declined to comment on the specifics of the information sought by Mr. Stringer, who has been weighing a possible challenge to the mayor, in the contract, which was signed by the city with Vievu, a Seattle-based company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The F.B.I. Questioned de Blasio. Hours Later, This Man Was Fired.", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHours after federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents finished questioning Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday as part of their investigation into his campaign fund-raising, a senior manager at an obscure New York City agency was unexpectedly called into a conference room.The manager, Ricardo Morales, the deputy commissioner of asset management at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, was told he was being fired.And as the mayor, who answered prosecutors\u2019 questions for four hours, was on his way to Atlanta for a meeting of the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Morales was escorted out of the agency\u2019s headquarters, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Mr. Morales\u2019s work helping oversee the management of city assets at the agency had brought him into the middle of two of the dozen or so matters that have come under federal scrutiny, as investigators have sought to determine whether the mayor or his aides traded favorable city action for donations to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign or his now-defunct political nonprofit organization.Nothing has come to light to suggest that Mr. Morales was involved in any wrongdoing, nor has he surfaced as a target or subject of the inquiry. But several people with knowledge of the matter indicated that he could well be a prosecution witness if charges are brought in connection with the role of the mayor or his aides in the lease negotiation.Mr. Morales\u2019s lawyer, Guy Oksenhendler, said city officials had given his client no reason for his firing. He said Mr. Morales \u201chas a terrific record of public service on behalf of the City of New York\u201d and was \u201chighly regarded by the superiors he worked for and the civil servants who were his subordinates.\u201dMr. Oksenhendler said, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily believe in things happening coincidentally.\u201d He added, \u201cI find it remarkably suspicious that the day that Mayor de Blasio met with the Southern District U.S. attorney\u2019s office, within hours of that meeting being concluded, my client\u2019s employment was terminated.\u201dHe said the firing was part of a broader reorganization. As examples, he listed several new hires, including the appointment of new deputy commissioners in May and October, and a chief of staff in January.\u201cCity Hall, while aware for some time that changes were in the works at DCAS \u2014 including the action on Mr. Morales \u2014 was not aware that these changes were set to take place on Thursday-Friday,\u201d he said.If indeed it was miscommunication and missteps that led to the curious and painful optics around Mr. Morales\u2019s firing, then it in some measure mirrored the failures on the part of other city officials surrounding the lifting of the deed restrictions. That matter was initially investigated by federal prosecutors and reviewed by two city agencies.The city reviews concluded that bad management, poor communication, inattention and weak controls were the cause, rather than corruption. And the lifting of the deed restrictions is apparently no longer among the matters federal prosecutors are pursuing as they wind down their investigation, people with knowledge of the matter have said.But, those people said, prosecutors are continuing to focus on the lease negotiations for the restaurant, the Water\u2019s Edge in Long Island City, which was owned by Harendra Singh, a longtime supporter of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s. The restaurant is on city land, and the negotiations in 2014 and 2015 were handled by the administrative services department on behalf of the city.Mr. de Blasio, who has steadfastly denied wrongdoing, said on NY1 on Monday night that it was \u201cperfectly fair\u201d for him to \u201cput forward concerns from community members, whether they\u2019re civic leaders, faith leaders, business leaders. But agencies have to make the decision they think is best.\u201dIn one example, the mayor was asked about reports that he had intervened to get favorable city action for Moshe Indig, a businessman and leader in the Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg.\u201cI don\u2019t intervene and tell agencies how to do their business,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cAgencies come to their own conclusion when they look at a community concern like the concern of a house of worship.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where History Is Being Made", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames and Deborah Fallows have always moved to where history is being made. In the 1980s, when the Japanese economic model seemed like the wave of the future, the husband and wife team moved to Japan with their school-age children. Then, after 9/11, they were back in Washington, with James writing a series of essays for The Atlantic about what might go wrong if the U.S. invaded Iraq.In 2006, they moved to China and both wrote books about China\u2019s re-emergence. Over the past few years they have been flying around the U.S. (James is a pilot), writing about the American social fabric \u2014 where it\u2019s in tatters and where it\u2019s in renewal. That was pretty prescient in the lead-up to the age of Trump.James and Deb have an excellent sense of where world-shaping events are taking place at any moment \u2014 and a fervent commitment to be there to see it happen.Their example has prompted what I call the Fallows Question, which I unfurl at dinner parties: If you could move to the place on earth where history is most importantly being made right now, where would you go?Let\u2019s start with a little historical perspective.If you had responded to the Fallows Question in 1968 you would have moved to California, both to the Bay Area and to Orange County. That would have put you at the epicenter of the \u201960s counterculture, and also at the center of the Reaganite conservatism that arose in response.By 1974, the most important place to be was the offices of the magazine Ms. For all its excesses, feminism has been the most important and the most salutary change of our lifetimes.By the 1980s, the big historical changes had to do with capitalism and finance, so either Japan or Wall Street was the place to be. In the early 1990s, Europe was the place to witness the end of communism and the false dawn of global peace. By the \u201990s, Silicon Valley was the most important driver of world historical change.The Fallows were clearly right to go witness the rise of China, but by 2006 I could also argue that equally important events were happening in Baghdad, Tehran and Damascus, with the crumbling of the modern Middle East.By 2010, the Fallows Question would have taken you to the neuroscience departments at universities like N.Y.U., Harvard and U.S.C., where cognitive scientists were rewriting our understanding of the human mind. By 2015, it would have taken you to working-class Ohio to witness the populist upheaval that is driving current global politics.Today, I\u2019d say the most pivotal spot on earth is Washington, D.C. The crucial questions will be settled there: Can Donald Trump be induced to govern in some rational manner or will he blow up the world? Does he represent a populist tide that will only grow or is some other set of ideas building for his overthrow? Are the leading institutions \u2014 everything from the Civil Service to the news media to the political parties \u2014 resilient enough to correct for the Trumpian chaos?Washington will either preserve the world order or destroy it.I sent the Fallows Question to the Fallows themselves, and they agreed in part with my Washington answer. But they also said that the most important place to be now might be places like Erie, Pa.; Fresno, Ca.; and Columbus, Ohio.Trump\u2019s presence in the White House may push change to the local levels. In these cities, the Fallows argue, citizen participants are coping with declining industries, creating new civic cultures, assimilating waves of immigration, collaborating across party lines to revive everything from arts programs to tech seedbeds.If you want to \u201cobserve\u201d history, the Fallows say, go to Washington. If you want to \u201cparticipate,\u201d go elsewhere.That\u2019s a good argument, but I suppose I should close by widening the possibilities. After all, few knew about Martin Luther in 1517 or what Deng Xiaoping would unleash in 1977. So maybe the most important spot on earth right now is to be found at:An evangelical church in Brooklyn that has come up with a style of faith that satisfies the spiritual needs of blue America.A National Front office in Paris where a French Stephen Bannon is plotting the final destruction of the European Union.A bio lab somewhere where researchers are finding ways to tailor cancer treatment to each patient\u2019s particular genetic makeup, thus lengthening lives and restructuring the phases of the typical human life.A set of universities, headquartered in Mauritius and spread throughout Africa, that will unleash the human potential of that continent at exactly the moment when the African future, in many places, is most promising.Most people can\u2019t up and move in search of history. They\u2019re tied down by work, family and spiritual commitments. But you only go around once in life, so if you can swing it, you might as well be where the action is.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Unusual (and Definitely Special) Engagement Rings", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI received my engagement ring after 11 years of marriage. I always wanted a rough diamond and my husband gave me one for my 51st birthday\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just the stone. We took it to the jeweler who designed our wedding rings and he worked with me to design the ring of my dreams. Set in rose gold and platinum and surrounded by a halo of tiny white diamonds, it fits between my 24 carat gold band and platinum and diamond band. It symbolizes our relationship:\u00a0imperfect, raw, beautiful, strong.Carole Williams, Richmond, Va.Diamonds were never my best friend. I have always thought them too obvious. So when I had to make a decision about what type of engagement ring I would wear, my jewelry designer\u00a0(Tammy Kohl of Takohl Fine Jewelry in Chicago)\u00a0gave me the perfect idea. \u201cHow about something from the past,\u00a0really far back.\u201d Intrigued, I followed her to her desk where she had an illustration of a 16th-century Italian wedding ceremony. The bride wore an intriguing ring that featured a setting resembling a jester\u2019s collar. The diamond in the middle was a pyramid. \u201cThis is an uncut diamond,\u201d\u00a0she\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cCloudy and mysterious.\u201d I was sold. I requested white gold, and she created a duplicate.Doris Ayres, ChicagoMy husband and I used to live in a small town of 1,200\u00a0in rural Western Colorado. We lived on the edge of an apple orchard in an old house with a big backyard and a view of the mesas outside of town. We nailed a hummingbird feeder to the fence,\u00a0and it swarmed with black-chinned and broad-tailed hummingbirds on summer nights. I discovered that if I held very still, I could stand within inches of the feeder and watch the birds\u00a0close up as they landed and fed.\u00a0My husband proposed to me on a different late summer night, in a different place. We were living in North Dakota then, and had gone for a swim in a lake on the prairie at 10 p.m. just as the sun was going down. He waded out to me with a little box. Inside was the hummingbird ring.\u00a0A few years later, when we moved to\u00a0Los Angeles, one of the first things I saw when I stepped into our new apartment was a hummingbird flitting by. We agreed it was a good omen.Emily Guerin, Los AngelesMy partner,\u00a0Brandon,\u00a0and I value the history and energy of objects we bring into our lives and our home. We also share a deep appreciation for the natural world. We grow our own food, hike through the North Georgia woods any chance we get, and fill our home with orchids of all varieties. When Brandon proposed atop a sandstone cliff in Canyonlands National Park\u00a0in Utah, my \u201cring\u201d was the ancient rock formations that surrounded us. Once we settled\u00a0at home in Atlanta, we searched for a ring that would reflect our unique bond, our love of nature\u00a0and our appreciation for history. The ring we found was perfect: an Art Deco era piece with a large, deep green marquis cut emerald and small old cut diamonds on the band. I have never seen another like it, although surely it was loved in an era long past. An emerald\u2019s inclusions are called its \u201cjardin,\u201d French for garden. Now when I wear my engagement ring, I carry with me a constant reminder of our extraordinary bond, our affinity for nature, and our connection to the past.Lauren Caudill, AtlantaI never liked diamonds and what they stood for,\u00a0but I did want a ring. My fianc\u00e9, now\u00a0my\u00a0husband for 10 years, and I went to a local store in Berkeley where\u00a0jewelry is still being created. I saw the color changing\u00a0sapphire (its color changes depending on the ambient light) in its unusual platinum setting.\u00a0I was taken right away.\u00a0I liked its uniqueness and my husband\u2019s\u00a0birthstone turned out to be sapphire (September). Luckily my fianc\u00e9\u00a0said yes to it.\u00a0And the ring,\u00a0and he,\u00a0are mine!Eva Carleton, Salzburg, AustriaKnowing of my career in public finance and my nerdy enjoyment of infrastructure issues, my\u00a0boyfriend\u00a0at the time,\u00a0(and now my\u00a0husband) Kenneth,\u00a0surprised me at a big party by proposing with this great infrastructure-themed ring\u00a0in 2009.\u00a0Its\u00a0design\u00a0resembles a series of water pipes. In the years since,\u00a0it has struck me that the ring symbolizes the way\u00a0our marriage bond undergirds our life together, supporting and nurturing our existence just as public infrastructure supports our communities.Jason Sisney, SacramentoI had no idea what kind of ring I wanted. I hadn\u2019t even\u00a0begun\u00a0looking when I saw this ring in the window of a vintage jeweler. I went back with my husband-to-be, tried it on, loved it\u00a0and\u00a0bought it. I loved it so much it acted as both my engagement\u00a0and\u00a0wedding ring\u00a0and\u00a0I wore it for the first time on our wedding day in New York.Jo Leggiero, DublinI knew I wanted something unique, but really had no clue what that meant. My\u00a0husband\u00a0(now)\u00a0and I popped into a local jeweler, who coined themselves \u201cjewelry architects.\u201d I thought maybe their sense of design would speak to me. And it did.\u00a0They had stunning jewelry. But of course, when looking at engagement rings you\u00a0are ushered over to the diamonds. I obliged and tried on diamonds, and while they were sparkly and stunning, none of them spoke to me. I noticed this gorgeous unique ring in the case and asked to try it on. The woman helping me said:\u00a0\u201cOh, that\u2019s a very special ring. It\u2019s an all-natural purple sapphire. It came out of the earth exactly as you see it. It\u2019s extremely rare to find such a stunning natural gem that doesn\u2019t need to be treated.\u201d She handed it to me, and I put it on. She then said, \u201cNow imagine a diamond in this setting, for your engagement ring.\u201d That ring felt like an extension of my body when I put it on, and I could never imagine it other than the way it was intended to be, with a natural purple sapphire.Zari Partridge, Charleston, S.C.I was working for a human rights organization in northern India when I met my husband, who is a chef and refugee from Tibet. He ran a French cafe in India and is an incredible singer of traditional Tibetan nomad songs. We were so broke when we met; we lived in a 10-foot-by-10-foot\u00a0concrete room with no hot water, but we were just happy to be together.\u00a0Our first date was a walk around the Dalai Lama\u2019s temple and our second date was to visit my husband\u2019s two adopted\u00a0children\u00a0at their boarding school. My grandmother gave us two pieces of her jewelry to use as rings, an unexpected and very kind gift. Mine is a basket-set opal and my husband\u2019s is a wide gold band with little arrows. We are so grateful for her blessing on our relationship.\u00a0Five\u00a0years later, we have a son\u00a0and treasure our unusual rings.Amberjade Tsering, WashingtonA friend of mine (jokingly) suggested that an engagement ring should be a carat for every year of dating, so I told my partner that he could meet his obligation if he asked sooner rather than later. Apparently it didn\u2019t incentivize him too much:\u00a0He proposed during our\u00a0seventh\u00a0year of dating, and we married at\u00a0eight\u00a0years,\u00a0two\u00a0months. The ring easily fit the\u00a0bill\u00a0with an\u00a08\u00bd\u00a0carat amethyst!Roc\u00edo Garza Tisdell, Natick, Mass.We love the sea, so I naturally found engagement-ring\u00a0inspiration from the ocean. After months of secretly sketching designs with shells, pebbles\u00a0and sea glass we had collected together from beaches around the world, I settled on the form of a simple band, cast from a strip of kelp.\u00a0Casting is a process in which plaster is used to surround an object. Heated to extreme temperatures the plaster remains but the object is\u00a0burned\u00a0away, leaving a space that may be filled with melted metal, producing a perfect replicate of the original. Macrocystis pyrifera is the predominant kelp of\u00a0Southern California\u2019s underwater marine forests.\u00a0An amazing diversity of fish and invertebrates make this kelp home.\u00a0I\u2019ll never forget the time Kristen gently extracted me from an impenetrable snag of kelp, in which I had found myself immobilized while diving offshore San Diego. Our engagement ring is this kelp cast in gold. It reminds me of the beautiful tangle of our lives.Chris Peregrin\u00a0(and Kristen Goodrich), San DiegoMy husband proposed with a ring he made from a\u00a0paper clip\u00a0and a shirt button. I wanted to have a copy made in gold wire and mother-of-pearl, but the goldsmith we went to in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, refused to produce something flimsy. Instead he created a heavy silver button and attached it to a beautifully\u00a0shaped gold ring. It catches the light like the original button. I like having something that was made especially for us and reminds me of my husband\u2019s romantic gestures. In the weeks during which\u00a0our jeweler\u00a0was making the ring,\u00a0my husband\u00a0would go and visit\u00a0on his lunch break to chat. They\u00a0talked about things like\u00a0how silly it is for people to ask to have the scratches in their wedding rings buffed out, because the accretion of wear better represents the beauty of enduring relationships.Allison Stielau, LondonOn our third date, I told my husband I assumed we would be married and before he invested time thinking about it, he should know there was only one ring I cared to wear as an engagement ring. Fortunately for him, I already owned it. Unfortunately, he would need to ask my parents for it after getting my father\u2019s permission to marry. This required his traveling to the\u00a0East Coast, keeping his intentions a secret, and overcoming an awkward conversation. He rose valiantly to the occasion, presenting me with the ring at a\u00a0riverside campsite by lantern light after a day full of Oregon adventures.\u00a0The ring is an Art Deco style cocktail ring from the\u00a01920s\u00a0that belonged to my namesake, Sadie Miller. It isn\u2019t fit for an adventurous life, so while I wore it consistently through our short engagement, I put it on now for special occasions. It reminds me how fortunate I am for the things that have gotten us where we are, and the things we have to share with future generations.Sadie Carney, Salem, Ore.Who says engagement rings have to have diamonds or gemstones? The diamond industry, that\u2019s who. Not my style. My engagement ring is made of English oak with an overlaid band of 14k gold, from a company called Northwood Rings. It\u2019s simple and light, and matches my taste for natural materials (and for breaking from tradition). Plus, I\u2019m a graduate of the Yale School of Forestry, so you know trees are close to my heart. I plan to match it with a narrow gold wedding band.Mariana Lo, New YorkWhen my\u00a0boyfriend\u00a0at the time\u00a0asked me to marry him\u00a010\u00a0years ago, he was about to start a Ph.D. program and I was an editorial assistant in New York. An expensive diamond didn\u2019t feel right to us; it didn\u2019t reflect our lives or who we were. This vintage cocktail ring made me feel like a movie star. The center stone is a citrine, and the white gold filigree is just beautiful. The whole thing cost less than $300. I still love it,\u00a0and him.Kristen Green Wiewora, Searcy, Ark.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mike Piazza Learns How to Be an Owner. Of a Soccer Team. In Italy.", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREGGIO EMILIA, Italy \u2014 Mike Piazza was jet-lagged and hungry, though you wouldn\u2019t have known it from his smile as he navigated the obstacle course of hugs, kisses and handshakes.\u201cHey! Ciao! Good to see you!\u201d he said.It has been 10 years since Piazza, 48, retired from baseball as one of the best-hitting catchers in history. It is common for stars of his stature to try out second careers in broadcasting, or simply to luxuriate in endless rounds of golf. Piazza last year decided he would become the majority owner of a third-division Italian soccer club, Reggiana.And so today, one year after his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the focus of Piazza\u2019s professional life is here in Reggio Emilia, a picturesque city 100 miles south of Milan \u2014 and about 5,000 miles from his home in Miami. Here, most people view the American pastime, if they know it at all, as a faraway curiosity. The locals understood that Piazza was famous when he arrived, but they needed Google to discover the reason. The level of renown he earns here will depend entirely on his ability to execute an ambitious plan to lift his beleaguered club back to the top flight of Italian soccer.So he kept moving on that recent Sunday morning, doling out bilingual small talk around the V.I.P. lounge of Reggiana\u2019s stadium before a recent game against Modena, a nearby rival. Cigarette smoke and the faint echoes of fans\u2019 chants wafted in from the stands. Parmigiano-Reggiano from a local sponsor was carved and shoveled onto plates of pumpkin tortellini. Finally, palms pressed and pleasantries exchanged, Piazza stole away to a modest private box where he could reflect on his professional transformation.\u201cI remember, as a player, complaining if we had a small plane,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018We couldn\u2019t get a 757? We had to get a 737? That\u2019s garbage. The owners are cheap.\u2019\u201d\u201cNow switch to me as the owner. I go: \u2018What the hell? One hundred dollars a room? Where are you guys staying, the Four Seasons?\u2019\u201dAs the game began, Piazza found himself fixated on how the rainy weather had affected ticket sales. While play crackled below him, he timed a rotating advertisement screen near the stands. Soon, Maurizio Franzone, the team\u2019s general manager, joined Piazza and his guests in the outdoor viewing area, and for the next two hours Piazza peppered him with questions about players and tactics.It was Franzone who first made contact with Reggiana\u2019s previous owners on Dec. 10, 2015. Piazza and Franzone have been friends for years, and they had long discussed the idea of investing in soccer. After the initial meeting, Franzone, who had spoken to about 20 other clubs in Italy, excitedly reported back to Piazza that it could be the perfect situation. Reggiana played in a large stadium that could eventually accommodate upper-league crowds. It boasted a training facility with 11 fields. It was geographically close to countless potential sponsors. It possessed a fan base desperate for brighter days.\u201cPut it this way: This is a team that needs to come back,\u201d said Franzone, 47, a former professional goalkeeper who favors three-piece suits and a finely groomed beard. \u201cThe people of Reggio Emilia need it.\u201dIt has not been easy being a Reggiana fan over the last two decades. In the 1990s, the club played in Serie A, the country\u2019s top tier, and in 1995, it opened a new stadium, which hundreds of the team\u2019s fans helped finance through the purchase of multiyear season ticket plans.But things quickly went awry. The team was relegated in 1997, and a few years later, after going bankrupt, it was forced to surrender the title to its stadium, which had been sold at auction. Today, the arena is owned by Giorgio Squinzi, the owner of the nearby Serie A team Sassuolo. The teams share the stadium, with Reggiana paying rent \u2014 an arrangement that causes its fans much embarrassment.But Piazza, for now, has gained the fans\u2019 trust. On June 18, 10 days after he announced a deal in principle to buy a majority stake in the club, thousands of fans greeted him with a rally in the main city square, serenading him with team songs. (He has declined to disclose financial details of the deal, but various local media outlets reported the investment was around $3 million.)And if there was some initial concern that Piazza might be a detached foreign owner, minding his investment from overseas, he has thus far dispelled it. He has made seven trips to Italy since buying the team, embracing a life of redeye flights. He has adopted a holistic approach to player development and pondered which elements of American sports culture could work in Italy. New sponsors have signed on; old ones that had abandoned the club in its lean years have returned. The number of season-ticket holders has doubled to 5,243, up from 2,615 last season.Currently Reggiana (14-5-7) sits in fourth place in the league standings.\u201cWe firmly believe in the Mike Piazza project,\u201d said Stefano Cavazzoni, 46, who lives in Reggio Emilia and began following the team in the early 1980s.\u201cHe made us feel close to him even though he\u2019s a very wealthy man,\u201d Miari said. He shrugged when asked to rate Piazza\u2019s language skills. \u201cHis Italian is like our English,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs practice.\u201dPiazza, who took six months of Italian lessons (and acknowledges that he needs more), has been brushing up on his soccer, too. He grew up near Philadelphia and had only a passing interest in the sport until he retired. He joked that he once thought Reggiana\u2019s favored formation was a 4-4-3, a nonsensical configuration. But Franzone said Piazza\u2019s baseball career had given him credibility with players and fans alike. \u201cThey know you know the smell of a locker room,\u201d he often tells Piazza.Sports ownership has its visceral joys, too, and Piazza was clearly enjoying himself as the game wore on. He yelled toward the field: \u201cDai, dai! Atta boy! Bravo! Get that ball!\u201d He drank an Aperol spritz and a few glasses of ros\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a bad headache,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we pull this game out, it\u2019ll be worth it. It\u2019s two Advil.\u201dThe conversation at halftime turned to the region\u2019s famous gastronomic tradition, or as Piazza called it, \u201cthe other reason I bought the team.\u201d He breathlessly cataloged the area\u2019s cured meats: \u201cThe prosciutto, the bresaola, the coppa, the mortadella \u2014 that\u2019s all here.\u201dNoting that he had met with groups aiming for expansion franchises in Major League Soccer before buying Reggiana, he said: \u201cI\u2019d rather be poor in Italy than based in St. Louis. You can\u2019t get a good meal there!\u201dWhen Reggiana scored its eventual winning goal in the second half, Piazza threw a left-handed uppercut \u2014 balancing the wineglass in his other hand \u2014 and let out a prolonged yell. He cursed when a Reggiana player injured himself and again when the fourth official announced that there would be four minutes of injury time.\u201cYeah!\u201d Piazza said when the final whistle blared, before closing his eyes and touching his chest. \u201cMamma mia.\u201dAfterward, several fans walked over to greet Piazza, addressing him as \u201cPresidente\u201d \u2014 the formality of which always makes his wife, Alicia Rickter, laugh. Piazza shook hands and posed for pictures. \u201cGrazie per essere venuti,\u201d he said. Thank you for coming.As he prepared to duck inside, an elderly man reached over to grab his hand. \u201cYou bring us good luck,\u201d the man said in Italian. \u201cPlease come again.\u201dThe next day, while eating lunch with Franzone in the city, Piazza likened owning a soccer team to harvesting macadamia trees, a process that can take five years to yield nuts. \u201cI wanted to come into a situation where there was something to build,\u201d he said.Piazza has adopted the same approach to life in Italy. He was 34 when he visited Italy for the first time. He had been to Japan seven times at that point in his life, but somehow never to the home country of his paternal grandparents.The trip changed him, he said. Growing up, he had absorbed a bundle of cultural idiosyncrasies \u2014 whether tastes, mannerisms or locutions \u2014 that sometimes manifested themselves explicitly or in other cases merely fizzed beneath his consciousness. In Rome, he found these stray fragments of his identity fitting naturally, exhilaratingly, into his surroundings.The next year, he and his father visited Sciacca, the town on the southwestern coast of Sicily where his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Giuseppe Piazza was born in 1789.\u201cI felt like a duck going back to water,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cI just related. I could just feel it. I just felt Italian.\u201dThese days, Piazza has been renting a home in a village called Quattro Castella, about 10 miles south of Reggio Emilia. He has considered having his children \u2014 Nicoletta, 10; Paulina, 7; and Marco, 3 \u2014 attend Italian schools for a year.In the restaurant, Piazza fiddled with the patterned scarf around his neck, joking that he accessorized like this only in Italy, where he felt sartorially inadequate alongside the locals. Scanning a menu, he made a face when he came across the horse tartare; his children were taking riding lessons, he explained.Piazza is enjoying this cross-cultural learning process. He said the rigors of this new life \u2014 stacking airline miles, struggling with a new language, savoring new foods, connecting to his family\u2019s roots \u2014 had invigorated him in the vacuum left by baseball.\u201cI played baseball for 16 years,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to reconcile the fact that I\u2019ll never again feel the juice of hitting a home run in front of 50,000 people.\u201dTo be sure, baseball still seeped into conversation during the first two days of his trip. Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and Byung-Hyun Kim were the two pitchers he never figured out. He thought the increasing reliance on \u201cMoneyball\u201d principles had precipitated his retirement. He called being booed at Yankee Stadium \u201cthe coolest thing I remember from my career.\u201dBut it is soccer, calcio, that consumes him now. \u201cI like the adventure of this,\u201d he said of the Reggiana project. \u201cI\u2019ll hop on a train. I\u2019ll hop on a plane. I\u2019ll get in the car. I\u2019ll just go. I like the energy.\u201dHe sipped Lambrusco, a sparkling red wine produced in the region. \u201cI could fail,\u201d he said. \u201cI could end up losing some money here. But it was important to me to step outside of my comfort zone.\u201dBrando de Leonardis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Endowment Sweepstakes: How Tiny Houghton College Beat Harvard", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThe hotly competitive returns of college endowment performance are out, and the results have again shaken the higher education elite down to their Ivy League roots: The smallest endowments \u2014 those with total assets under $25 million \u2014 outperformed their billion-dollar-plus rivals for the second year.The National Association of College and University Business Officers, known as Nacubo, and the Commonfund Institute last week released the latest results, which are, for most schools, far more important than whether they advance to the N.C.A.A. Final Four.The 2016 fiscal year, which ended June 30, wasn\u2019t an especially good year for anybody. But the smallest endowments outperformed the billion-plus group, losing 1 percent, on average, compared with a 1.9 percent decline for the biggest endowments.Results were even worse for endowments of $500 million to $1 billion, which lost on average 2.2 percent.Houghton emerged in the top quartile of all endowments, according to Nacubo, with a return of 11.85 percent for the year ended Sept. 30. (Houghton uses a different fiscal year.) For the calendar year, the results were also impressive, at 7.45 percent. Houghton has been able to lower its spending rate \u2014 the amount it withdraws each year to fund operations \u2014 to an enviable 4.5 percent, and may be able to lower it further, to 4 percent.How did tiny Houghton do it?The answer is pretty simple: Houghton got out of hedge funds and all alternative investments a year and a half ago, and moved the entire portfolio to a mix of low-cost index funds and mutual funds at the fund giant Vanguard.Houghton\u2019s investment committee met this week, and is likely to move even further from active management, Mr. Morris said. \u201cI went to the University of Chicago, where I sat in a lot of investment classes,\u201d he told me. He learned how difficult it was for active managers to outperform market averages, \u201cespecially year after year,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in passive investment.\u201dAs for hedge funds and other high-cost alternatives, \u201cthe whole two-and-20 model\u201d \u2014 in which investors typically pay 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gains \u2014 \u201cis ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Morris said. \u201cThe cost structure is outrageous. As they say on Wall Street, \u2018Where are the customers\u2019 yachts?\u2019 I\u2019m not going to play that game.\u201dHoughton\u2019s experience with hedge funds predates Mr. Morris\u2019s arrival on campus, but their performance was \u201cmediocre at best,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe investment committee and I are on the same page about moving to less active management and lower costs.\u201dAs Houghton\u2019s experience suggests, the past year\u2019s disparity in results between the large and small endowments can almost entirely be explained by the differing allocations to alternative investments, especially hedge funds.According to the association\u2019s survey, endowments larger than $1 billion had 58 percent of their assets in alternative strategies on average, with 20 percent in hedge funds and 12 percent in private equity.The smallest endowments \u2014 those of less than $25 million \u2014 had just 10 percent in alternatives, with 6 percent in hedge funds and a mere 1 percent in private equity.Stung by overexposure to the troubled pharmaceutical company Valeant International, and taken by surprise by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, hedge funds, on average, lagged far behind both the S.&P. 500 and fixed-income returns in fiscal 2016.As a result, the performance of a simple low-cost mix of stocks and bonds, much like the portfolio Houghton assembled, has streaked past the more complex portfolios laden with hedge funds and other alternative investments.Vanguard said a simple mix of index funds with 70 percent in equities and 30 percent in fixed-income assets delivered an annualized return of 7.1 percent over the past five years, and 6.1 percent over the past 10. For a mix of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, the returns were 6.7 percent for five years and 6.1 percent for 10.By comparison, the annualized returns for the billion-plus endowments were 6.1 percent for five years and 5.7 percent for 10.Hedge funds, however, have successfully marketed themselves as offering higher risk-adjusted rates of return, in part because they supposedly minimize losses in down years. But according to Vanguard\u2019s calculations, its simple, low-cost model portfolios have provided higher returns even after adjusting for risk in eight of the past 11 years.Most investors \u201cwould have been much better off in a low-cost, broadly diversified portfolio than in these other complex vehicles,\u201d Christopher Philips, head of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services, said.Harvard reported its hedge fund portfolio lost 1.2 percent for the 2016 fiscal year. The university said it had 14 percent of its assets in \u201cabsolute return\u201d strategies \u2014 meant to ensure that the return is always positive, rather than pegged to a benchmark \u2014 a category that includes hedge funds.Nonetheless, in a report written by the previous chief executive of Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university\u2019s endowment, Harvard said that \u201cwe continue to believe that partnering with best-in-class managers will lead to attractive risk-adjusted returns.\u201dWhy Harvard would harbor such a belief after years of hedge fund underperformance remains a mystery to some.\u201cSupposedly the big endowments have access to better managers,\u201d Mr. Morris said. \u201cI may be more cynical, but I\u2019m not sure I buy that. How do you know who the better managers are? I\u2019m not convinced that any manager can outperform\u201d over the long-term horizons of most endowments.Mr. Philips of Vanguard agreed. \u201cThe ultimate challenge is picking the hedge fund managers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many, you end up seeing the same distribution of returns that you see in mutual funds except there are twice as many hedge funds.\u201dMr. Narvekar has already shaken up the endowment\u2019s management, saying Harvard will lay off roughly half its 230 employees by the end of the next fiscal year, including all of its internal hedge fund managers. He promised to outsource more of the endowment\u2019s investment decisions.Even so, no one expects Harvard \u2014 or any other major endowment \u2014 to ditch hedge funds anytime soon. Hope springs eternal, and the allure of potentially higher returns is paradoxically more potent the lower the actual returns are.\u201cIf I put myself in the shoes of an endowment manager, I can sympathize,\u201d Mr. Philips said. \u201cYou have to keep ahead of inflation and contribute to the operating budget at a time when return expectations are muted. So you feel compelled to reach for hedge funds or private equity in the hope you\u2019ll outperform.\u201dWhile Vanguard hasn\u2019t seen any stampede out of hedge funds and other alternatives among college endowments, \u201cthose hopes are starting to come up against reality,\u201d Mr. Philips said.The Common Sense column on Feb. 10 discussed the investing success of endowments at small colleges compared with those at larger institutions. The column cited Houghton College, in western New York, which reported an investment return of 11.85 percent for the year ended Sept. 30. Because that period was different from the one reported by other colleges, however, the column did not give a clear picture of Houghton\u2019s relative performance. In a more comparable period \u2014 from August 2015 (when Houghton changed investment managers) to June 2016 (the end of year reported by most other colleges) \u2014 its return for 10 \u00bd months was 2.98 percent. The column also misstated, using information from the college, the return for the calendar year. It was 7.45 percent, not 7.54 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Geert Wilders, Reclusive Provocateur, Rises Before Dutch Vote", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySPIJKENISSE, the Netherlands \u2014 He wants to end immigration from Muslim countries, tax head scarves and ban the Quran. He is partly of Indonesian heritage, and dyes his hair bright blond. He is omnipresent on social media but lives as a political phantom under police protection, rarely campaigning in person and reportedly sleeping in a different location every night.He has structured his party so that he is the only official, giving him the liberty to remain, above all things, in complete control, and a provocateur and an uncompromising verbal bomb thrower.Geert Wilders, far-right icon, is one of Europe\u2019s unusual politicians, not least because he comes from the Netherlands, one of Europe\u2019s most socially liberal countries, with a centuries-long tradition of promoting religious tolerance and welcoming immigrants.How he and his party fare in the March 15 elections could well signal how the far right will do in pivotal elections in France, Germany and possibly Italy later this year, and ultimately determine the future of the European Union. Mr. Wilders (pronounced VIL-ders) has promised to demand a \u201cNexit\u201d referendum on whether the Netherlands should follow Britain\u2019s example and leave the union.\u201cThe Netherlands is kind of a bellwether, a lot of trends manifest themselves here first,\u201d said Hans Anker, a Dutch political strategist who has worked both in the Netherlands and the United States.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule out that Wilders could be prime minister,\u201d he added. \u201cThis one is fundamentally unpredictable.\u201dRemarkably, Mr. Wilders, 53, has managed to build a movement despite his infrequent public appearances. Living under threat since the police discovered plots against him in 2004 has turned him into a politician ahead of his time, using the internet and later social media to talk to voters without the filter of journalists.It has proved a particularly effective means of reaching disillusioned citizens. Other politicians have followed his lead but almost none have done it as effectively, Dutch experts said.We want to hear from people in the Netherlands about how immigration has affected their lives and views.\u201cHe\u2019s the most strategic, smartest politician out there,\u201d said Sarah de Lange, a political science professor at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cHe\u2019s very skilled. He\u2019s a very good debater. He has media savvy. Internationally, he\u2019s compared to Trump. But with Wilders every tweet is thought through, calculated. With Trump it\u2019s emotional.\u201dRight now Mr. Wilders\u2019s party looks set to win more seats than any other or to come in second. However, he has historically polled better before elections than he has performed in them. Still, after pollsters underestimated the likelihood of both Brexit and the victory of Donald Trump last year, no one is relying on predictions.But whether Mr. Wilders\u2019s party wins the most votes, or enters a government, hardly matters. He has already succeeded in one of his main ambitions \u2014 to push politics in the Netherlands to the right and make possible a conversation about shutting out immigrants and dismantling the European Union that was unthinkable not long ago.Mr. Wilders is close ideologically to Marine Le Pen of France, the far-right National Front leader who is set to make it to a runoff in presidential elections this spring. He was also close to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and is sometimes even called the \u201cDutch Trump,\u201d though he has a far longer political history and as many differences as similarities.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Wilders is unafraid to say things in the most direct, divisive, dismissive, and often disparaging and insulting of ways. Similar to Mr. Trump, many of his supporters feel buoyed and relieved that he is giving voice to what they cannot say, or feel they are not supposed to say.The one time Mr. Wilders was in government, in 2010, he had an informal liaison with the mainstream conservative party\u2019s coalition, but he bolted when it wanted to cut back pension benefits. Those in his parliamentary group are not technically members of his party, allowing Mr. Wilders to entirely control his party\u2019s platform and decision-making.Being a party of one also allows him to avoid most campaign finance and disclosure rules, leaving the sources of his money murky, though he receives funding from at least one American conservative group.Mr. Wilders describes himself as an outsider. Yet he is the third-longest-sitting member of the Dutch Parliament and has spent his life in politics since he was about 28.In recent years, because of the apparent threats against him, Mr. Wilders has become progressively more isolated. He sees his wife once or twice a week and has cut off his brother, who disagrees with him politically, the brother has said in media interviews. He maintains the image of being present through carefully dispensing Twitter posts, videos and television interviews. His rare public appearances guarantee that every time he ventures out he attracts a media circus.Last week, he suspended his campaign appearances altogether after reports that a member of his police security detail was suspected of leaking his movements to a Dutch-Moroccan criminal gang.He has also traveled on many occasions to Israel, for which he developed a deep affection after spending months on a kibbutz as a young man. He is described by political compatriots as friendly with Benjamin Netanyahu, the right-wing Israeli prime minister.Over time, Mr. Wilders\u2019s own positions have hardened, his colleagues said. He arrived in The Hague, the Netherlands, in 1991-92 as a parliamentary assistant in the mainstream conservative party then led by Frits Bolkestein.Today Mr. Bolkestein likens Mr. Wilders to \u201cthe sorcerer\u2019s apprentice,\u201d who, the story goes, uses one of his newly learned spells to enchant a broom into washing the floor for him.Soon the water is all over, and he realizes that he does not know how to stop the broom. He tries splitting it in two with an ax, but then there are two brooms, then four. \u201cThe apprentice can\u2019t stop,\u201d Mr. Bolkestein said.It is an apt description of Mr. Wilders, who sometimes seems to try to outdo himself more for shock value and to grab attention than for practical effect, particularly on immigration.\u201cIn 2012 his position was no new mosques in the Netherlands; now it is \u2018close all the mosques,\u2019 \u201d said Michiel Servaes, a Labor Party member in Parliament who has served with him. \u201cIn 2012 it was limit asylum seekers to 1,000 a year; now it\u2019s \u2018no new asylum seekers.\u2019 \u201dYet Mr. Wilders\u2019s stands have brought the mainstream right to advocate strict limits on aid for immigrants and helped spawn new small right-wing parties, all with strong positions against immigration and in support of stricter rules to push immigrants to accept Dutch culture, Mr. Servaes said.E. C. Hendriks, a political sociologist who is allied with a new far-right party, the Forum for Democracy, says unease with immigration and disillusionment with the European Union are rife. \u201cCertain groups in Dutch society have had trouble integrating,\u201d he said.Yet immigrants are costly for the Dutch since the country has a generous social welfare system and pays for newcomers\u2019 education, health care, housing and food.\u201cSo if certain groups come and do not speak Dutch and do not share our values, if they don\u2019t integrate, it\u2019s a bigger problem,\u201d he said.The Netherlands, with its religious tolerance and relative prosperity \u2014 unemployment is among the lowest in Europe \u2014 may seem an unlikely place for the far right to take hold.Yet it is another measure of Mr. Wilders\u2019s idiosyncratic appeal that in a country with such an open lifestyle, some Dutch are turning to him to safeguard their liberal social values.A longtime parliamentary colleague, Harry van Bommel, who came to office in 1998, the same year as Mr. Wilders, said it was difficult to deny that the political winds had shifted in his favor. \u201cIn this country there is an underestimation of the number of people who are afraid of Islam,\u201d he said.It was against this backdrop that Mr. Wilders formed his own party and began to find a wider audience. Today he has pockets of strength in almost every part of the country.As Mr. Wilders opened his campaign this month in one of his strongholds in the Rotterdam suburb of Spijkenisse, supporters stood with arms folded in the cold gray morning in the central square, as vendors hawked fresh herring and the police and security guards tried to keep back a media scrum.Among the crowd was Ieg Van Haperen, 66, a former postal worker who complained that prices had gone up but pensions had not. Like many Dutch, she feels Mr. Wilders goes too far in his condemnations of Islam, but \u201cthe borders indeed have to close,\u201d she said.In his hometown, Venlo, a stone\u2019s throw from the German border, where locals speak a dialect all their own, Carnival was in full swing as Mr. Wilders opened his campaign miles away.There was speculation that Mr. Wilders might visit, though it seems he has distanced himself from the one place where his Indonesian heritage on his mother\u2019s side is generally known. His mother is half Indonesian; her parents returned to Venlo around the time Holland gave up its colonies in Indonesia, according to a Dutch anthropologist and journalist, Lizzy van Leeuwen.Few seemed even to have met the hometown boy in a place that remains a seemingly tolerant bastion in perhaps a waning Dutch tradition.\u201cI asked myself what I would say if a journalist asked me if Geert Wilders was welcome here,\u201d said Roel Versleijen, the president of Jocus, the association that coordinates Venlo\u2019s celebration.He was indeed asked, by this one.\u201cWell, everyone is welcome to celebrate,\u201d he said, \u201cbut his political views are not widely supported.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to Netherlands politics. No one party has ever held a majority in the Dutch Parliament; it is not the case that no one party has held a majority only in the last 20 years or so.Christopher Schuetze contributed reporting from The Hague, and Milan Schreuer from Amsterdam.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Push to Meddle With the Fed Is Part of a Global Trend", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThat sounds pretty unobjectionable. But for the Federal Reserve, the most important American financial regulator, the traditional response would have been: Leave us alone.The Fed, the nation\u2019s central bank, has long prized its independence. It has thought that it should decide for itself the best way to regulate American financial institutions, unfettered by unsophisticated, and potentially venal, political oversight.But political leaders around the world are not at all shy about interfering with what the central banks do.Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order reflects a global mood. Politicians in Britain and elsewhere in Europe have also started to publicly lament the conduct of their central banks.During her testimony to Congress this week, Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, was criticized for both the Fed\u2019s monetary policy and its regulation of banks.Legislators also blamed the Fed for the sort of overregulation that the president\u2019s executive order is designed to address. The House Financial Services Committee chairman, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, criticized \u201ca failed regulatory state\u201d for impeding growth, with the implication being that the Fed was part of the problem.Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, argued that the Fed was incorrectly concluding that the \u201cprospect for growth is not at all changed by the prospect of tax reform and regulatory reform.\u201dIf anything, the political caviling is even more pointed abroad.The German finance minister said last year that the European Central Bank\u2019s current low interest rates were causing \u201cextraordinary problems.\u201d That complaint was characterized by his boss, Chancellor Angela Merkel, as \u201clegitimate.\u201d During the financial crisis, the French president told the central bank to raise rates, and he was hardly the only European politician to do so.The European practice of political criticism of central bank policies has spread to Britain, where the prime minister has criticized the Bank of England\u2019s low interest rates.\u201cA change has got to come\u201d on those rates, Prime Minister Theresa May has said.This sort of political input does not line up with the laws on the books in either Britain or on the Continent. The British government gave the central bank operational independence in 1997. European treaties isolate the European Central Bank from political oversight.The Fed has some statutory independence, and the power to cover its budget without seeking appropriations from Congress certainly helps. Most important of all, however, the Fed has benefited from a culture of political noninterference.But if the recent experiences of Europe are any guide, cultural independence can be fleeting. Central banks find it very difficult to operate as pure technocracies, operated by experts for the benefit of an uninterested citizenry. Citizens do, it turns out, care about their central banks, and these days, politicians across the globe have been willing to attack them for political ends.Most academics would defend central bank independence from political oversight. Central banks that manage the currency without political interference generally bring inflation under control. That in turn makes it easier for investors to plan.A place for politics in central banking is not wholly inappropriate. The financial crisis has taught us that central banks like the Fed can be political actors, willing to lobby the politicians in the executive and legislative branches, and to work closely with them on policy objectives.But it will also be instructive to see how far politicians try to push the Fed. Inveighing against insulated technocrats has some appeal \u2014 that might be one reason to insulate them.But if the president and Congress realize that they have the potential to directly affect interest rates, they may find that central bank independence is not such a bad thing after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Founders\u2019 Grip Tightened After a Spat With an Early Investor", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLightspeed, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, was the first institution to invest in Snap, the company that popularized disappearing messages, and it is now set to reap more than $1 billion from what began as a mere $485,000 investment.At the heart of that is a Lightspeed venture capitalist, Jeremy Liew, and the terms he embedded in his 2012 investment in what was then known as Snapchat. The terms gave Mr. Liew outsize power over the company\u2019s future financing round. That ended up irking Snapchat\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Spiegel, who took steps to reassert control over the company.Mr. Liew and Mr. Spiegel met in March 2012, when Mr. Liew used Facebook to contact Mr. Spiegel, a Stanford University student who had recently started Snapchat with Mr. Murphy, a fraternity brother. At the meeting that followed, Mr. Spiegel said his father was tired of paying Snapchat\u2019s bills. Mr. Liew offered to help.Mr. Liew offered to invest $485,000 in Snapchat, which Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy accepted. The investment was completed in less than two weeks.What Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy paid less attention to were the exact terms that Mr. Liew embedded in the deal. Those terms gave Lightspeed the right of first refusal to invest in a future round of funding and the ability to increase its share of the company in that round. Lightspeed could also take 50 percent of the future round.Such terms effectively let Lightspeed have veto power over investment at Snap. It also made Snap an unattractive investment for other investors \u2014 who would not be able to take as large a stake as they would like in the company.Mr. Liew\u2019s terms prevented the deal. A General Catalyst spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.\u201cI\u2019ve since learned that standard means either the person who\u2019s walking you through documents doesn\u2019t understand them or you could be getting taken advantage of,\u201d Mr. Spiegel continued. \u201cWhen someone says something is standard, just ask why, and why and why and why, until you really understand intricately, I think, how the deal is structured.\u201dMr. Spiegel embarked on a way to work around Lightspeed and Mr. Liew so that he could get the investors he wanted in the future. To do so, he struck a deal with Mr. Liew: Lightspeed would be able to buy a limited number of Snapchat shares at a discount. In exchange, the venture firm would remove its right-of-first-refusal clause and other terms that the Snapchat founders considered onerous.Mr. Spiegel later added provisions of his own to Snapchat\u2019s corporate charter. He authorized the creation of a class of preferred stock, FP Preferred, which would have 10-to-1 voting rights, allowing its holders to exercise far more voting power than holders of regular, or common, stock.Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy control the FP Preferred shares, which also gives them the power to vote on many things, including the rights of other shareholders. The Snap founders\u2019 overwhelming control of the company is now one of the most talked-about features in its I.P.O. filing.Early institutional investors often take board seats with the companies they nurture and become key advisers. Mr. Liew was not chosen to be an early board member, but other venture investors have joined Snap\u2019s board since. Mitch Lasky, a partner at Benchmark, became a board member in 2013 after his firm led an investment round in Snapchat.Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Lasky are close. According to emails between them that have become public, Mr. Lasky has advised Mr. Spiegel on Snap\u2019s valuation and fund-raising, among other things.Mr. Liew remains special to Snap in one way: He was the first and last investor to get special terms from the company. In subsequent deals, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy retained voting control and did not grant preferential treatment to investors.An article on Friday about the relationship between the creators of Snap and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Lightspeed misstated terms that Lightspeed was granted when it became the first investor in Snap. Lightspeed was granted the right of first refusal to invest and the ability to increase its share of the company in the next round of funding for Snap, not in multiple future rounds of funding.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Tech Sector Shrugs Off Regional Uncertainty", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are plenty of reasons to avoid doing business in Europe: sluggish economic growth, concerns over security and terrorism, as well as political uncertainty.But venture capitalists and tech start-ups across the region have considered those risks and met them with a collective shrug.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some political headwinds, but the underlying European tech ecosystem remains strong,\u201d Mr. Zennstrom, 51, said in an interview.\u201cSuccess of tech companies is very binary: They will work or they will not,\u201d he added. \u201cSome macroeconomic ups-and-downs are not going to make a big difference.\u201dAnalysts say that Europe\u2019s smaller pool of venture capital may have helped the region\u2019s start-ups to avoid some of the excesses of Silicon Valley, where many new companies have received millions, if not billions, of dollars \u2014 often at eye-watering valuations \u2014 only for their business ideas to fall flat.Ciaran O\u2019Leary, a partner at BlueYard Capital, a Berlin-based venture firm, said most European start-ups still did not have the luxury of burning through their fund-raising at record speeds. Instead, he said, they must focus on generating revenues at an early stage, even if that hurts their global expansion plans.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a chilling effect on funding, but start-ups really have to focus on getting their operations right,\u201d he said.For Mr. Zennstrom, who moved to London in 2002, before the creation of Skype, the drastic fall in the cost of technology and an increasingly global talent pool of engineers mean that it has never been easier to start a company in the region.\u201cIn Europe, we don\u2019t have the luxury of endless amounts of money,\u201d Mr. Zennstrom said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to work in a smarter way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Look Past Headlines as Bull Market Roars Ahead", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkets hate uncertainty. It is one of the oldest saws in finance.Yet even as a series of political scandals flare up in President Trump\u2019s nascent administration, raising questions about his ability to pursue an investor-friendly agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal spending, the stock market just roars ahead.For the most part, the stumbles by the administration have not been related to promises that Mr. Trump made \u2014 and that investors embraced \u2014 to recharge an economy that most economists believe is growing at subpar levels.Still, that investors have chosen to ignore the chaos in Washington highlights just how deep is the belief (others might consider it wishful thinking) that Mr. Trump, at his root, is a president who will deliver market-friendly policies.\u201cI fully get the euphoria \u2014 there has probably never been a more business-friendly president,\u201d said Adrian Helfert, the head of global fixed income at Amundi Smith Breeden. \u201cLower taxes and less regulations are good for corporations and equity holders.\u201dSince Election Day, the S.&P. 500 index is up over 9 percent, and with money continuing to pour into stocks from bond and money market funds, the bull market is showing few signs of letting up.On Wednesday, stocks continued their run for a seventh consecutive session \u2014 the longest winning streak since September 2013, according to Bloomberg data. The S.&P. 500 gained 0.5 percent, led by health care and financial stocks.But as the markets climb and corporate borrowing rates remain historically low, Mr. Helfert worries that investors are taking too lightly the possible pitfalls of this high-risk, high-return Trump presidency.\u201cHe is pulling out all the stops,\u201d he said, \u201cand I just don\u2019t think that investors are being compensated for the downside risks.\u201dMr. Helfert points to the VIX index, or Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d which measures the expectations investors have that markets will convulse sharply in the future. Since Mr. Trump became president, the index has been trading at very low levels, unperturbed by political histrionics.Of course, it is also true that a market that goes up for a sustained period, without the wild swings that have characterized past run-ups, will not set off volatility alarm bells.And in that regard, Mr. Trump\u2019s political supporters on Wall Street say they are not surprised by the market\u2019s willingness to charge ahead.What is driving enthusiasm, some investors say, is not so much that Mr. Trump is pressing down on the gas pedal with promises to increase spending and cut taxes, but rather his desire to take his foot off the brake and remove investor and business restrictions. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said his top priorities include rolling back regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama to keep large banks and funds in check.That Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president, has emerged as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and most influential advisers in this regard, is also seen as a sign that deregulation will remain at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda.And risk takers have not just taken heart in the administration\u2019s pledge to dismantle the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Some smaller loosening of financial regulations has also provided encouragement.This week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main derivatives regulator, said it would not penalize institutions for violating new derivatives standards.And a Dodd-Frank rule that required energy companies to disclose whether they made payments to foreign governments was recently voided by Congress.These are by no means giant moves, but they send a powerful signal all the same to investors frustrated by Obama-era restraints.One money manager and active fund-raiser for Mr. Trump during the election said that while many have seen disorder and disarray in the White House, he has seen a man of action doing whatever is needed to get the economy to grow faster.But here is another thought.Perhaps investors, after 10 years of living in constant fear over a succession of financial and political cataclysms, have finally decided to tune out the headlines and focus instead on an economy that, while not great, is not doing so bad, either.Ed Yardeni, a stock market strategist, calculates that savings deposits and money market funds, the two safest and lowest return options for the risk-wary, doubled to nearly $9 trillion at the end of last month from $4.5 trillion in early 2009.A lot of this caution was driven by the trauma of the financial crisis, of course, but it has been sustained in the years since by persistent worries (political and otherwise) that the markets will collapse again or the economy will tank. These anxieties have been reflected in persistent swings in the VIX index in recent years.Now, a lot of this pent-up cash earning close to zero in terms of interest rates is looking for higher returns in the stock market \u2014 with pension funds in particular leading the way.\u201cThe reality is that the real G.D.P. of the economy has never been higher and that consumer spending per household is at an all-time high,\u201d said Mr. Yardeni, who has been arguing for some time that markets have been obsessing needlessly over worrying headlines.\u201cThroughout all these corrections, people have been talking about an endgame,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe people have figured out that you can watch the news all you want and get upset, but that has nothing to do with earnings and the valuation of earnings in the stock market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoFi to Acquire Zenbanx, Allowing It to Be More Like a Bank", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The financial start-up SoFi is getting closer to its ambition of being able to replace your bank.SoFi, or Social Finance as it is officially known, announced Tuesday that it was acquiring a company, Zenbanx, allowing SoFi to offer checking accounts, credit cards and international money transfers to its customers.SoFi, based in San Francisco, began in 2011 by refinancing student loans taken out by graduates of elite universities. Since succeeding in that niche, the company has expanded into personal loans, mortgage lending, asset management and even life insurance. But until now it has not been able to accept deposits, one of the most basic functions of a bank.Zenbanx was founded by the former chief executive of ING Direct, Arkadi Kuhlmann. It has built a clientele for online savings accounts that allow customers to move easily among different currencies, while using A.T.M.s to get access to cash.SoFi is tiny compared with even midsize banks \u2014 it currently has about 225,000 \u201cmembers,\u201d as it calls its customers. But it has announced its Silicon Valley-grade ambitions to take on the biggest banks with advertising campaigns \u2014 including one during last year\u2019s Super Bowl \u2014 that use the tagline \u201cDon\u2019t Bank. SoFi.\u201dSoFi has found a way to continue expanding its business at a time when most other online lenders have had to scale back their ambitions.The latest acquisition will allow SoFi to extend those relationships further. By making it easy to move money among currencies, Zenbanx could be attractive for SoFi\u2019s more elite, cosmopolitan clientele.Given SoFi\u2019s frequent criticism of mainstream banks through such means as interviews, blog posts and advertising, it has faced many questions about whether it could eventually become a bank itself. SoFi\u2019s chief executive, Mike Cagney, has said in the past that the company had discussed getting a bank charter in Utah.The Zenbanx acquisition would appear to give SoFi a way to offer the basic functions of a bank without needing a bank charter. Zenbanx completes its transactions through a partnership with WSFS Bank, which is based in Delaware. That setup is expected to continue after the acquisition by SoFi is complete, which is expected to happen in February.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret Art History on Your Money", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoney talks. And these days, it also walks.American currency is set for its biggest image overhaul in decades as an old face is demoted \u2014 that means you, Andrew Jackson! \u2014 and some new ones, less uniformly white and male, arrive.The images on legal tender are perhaps the most widely circulated art in the world, but where do they come from? That\u2019s the question explored by \u201cImages of Value,\u201d an exhibition at the Grolier Club in Manhattan devoted to the underpondered truism that financial art, like the bills it is printed on, doesn\u2019t grow on trees.The more than 250 items on view come from the collection of Mark D. Tomasko, a retired lawyer who became fascinated by the beauty of financial art at age 10, when his grandmother gave him an obsolete stock certificate from the old Marmon Motor Car Company. Today he is the rare collector who focuses on tracking down the original artwork behind the engravings on bank notes, stock certificates and other financial documents.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an Easter egg hunt,\u201d Mr. Tomasko said during a recent interview in the gallery, taking out his smartphone to show a visitor the hundreds of engraved \u201cfancy heads,\u201d or decorative female heads, he keeps on hand for reference. \u201cI enjoy putting together the puzzle.\u201dThe show, on view through April 29, presents a kind of shadow art history, driven not by bohemians in their studios or working en plein-air but by a rarefied if staid-looking crew of artists and engravers who suited up every day to work at outfits like the American Bank Note Company. The company was the king of an industry that \u2014 like the dollar itself \u2014 ruled the world well into the 20th century, when financial \u201cdematerialization\u201d and other forces took their toll.Today, going cashless is easy, but when paper is required Mr. Tomasko likes his lucre very clean.\u201cI only use new money,\u201d he said, pulling a hyper-crisp Benjamin out of his wallet to point out its high-tech anti-counterfeiting features.And what happens when he gets change?He paused, then said, deadpan: \u201cI try not to get change.\u201dHere is a sampling of items Mr. Tomasko has retrieved from the vast, gorgeous and sometimes bewildering dustbin of American financial art history.Before the Civil War, American currency was a confusing welter of notes issued by state banks. The notes often bore pastoral vignettes heavy on cows, wagons, haystacks and other features of rural life, sometimes subtly adjusted. (In one bill from a South Carolina bank, a white fieldworker seen in the background of the source image was transformed into an African-American, presumably a slave.)That dizzying demand helped create the American security engraving industry, while also leaving people uncertain whether the bills they held were any good. \u201cIt was a beautiful, difficult currency,\u201d Mr. Tomasko said.The \u201cfancy heads\u201d both prettied things up and made the documents harder to counterfeit. A $1 bill issued by the Corn Exchange Bank of Wisconsin in the 1850s or \u201960s, shown at top, includes a head derived from a painting by the French artist Constant Joseph Brochart. Mr. Tomasko bought the lithograph shown above, which is based on Brochart, just because he liked it. Later he realized it had been engraved and used on a bank note. \u201cIt was entirely accidental,\u201d he said.The first general-circulation United States currency appeared in 1861, when the government, to finance the Civil War, issued non-interest-bearing $10 demand notes, with Abraham Lincoln on the front. The United Stated Bureau of Engraving and Printing was created in 1874 and took over production of all American currency in 1877.The faces on the front weren\u2019t always the all-dude lineup we know today. Before there was Harriet Tubman (coming soon to the $20), there was Martha Washington, who appeared solo on the front of a $1 silver certificate in 1886 (shown above), and then alongside her husband on the back of another one issued in 1896. (Today, George has the $1 all to himself.)The bureau has no record of the source image, but Mr. Tomasko said it was a portrait by Charles Fran\u00e7ois Jalabert, which he also circulated via 19th-century cards, magazine illustrations and lithographs. Like all United States currency issued since 1861, these bills remain valid at their full face value, but if you want to buy an 1886 Martha, you\u2019ll need to fork over as many as 1,500 Georges.After the federal government took over production of currency, American Bank Note focused on the foreign market. In the first half of the 20th century, its biggest customer was China.Chinese bank notes, Mr. Tomasko said, generally did not feature faces. Instead, they showed buildings and landscapes, often drawn from photographs, which were becoming an increasingly important source of imagery for securities.The image on the 1918 bill for the Asia Banking Corporation shown above depicted the old walls around Beijing, now gone; the image comes from a picture postcard, with a sky drawn in before engraving, to create a richer scene. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to engrave good skies,\u201d Mr. Tomasko said.The Chinese Revolution of 1949 put an end to that market. Two other major American Bank Note customers, Mexico and Brazil, also created their own industries in the 1960s, dealing another blow.By the 20th century, American Bank Note and other companies commonly commissioned original art rather than taking images from the broader culture, partly because the salon art of the 19th century had given way to new movements whose images were \u201cnot suitable\u201d for currency vignettes, as Mr. Tomasko\u2019s catalog puts it.If there\u2019s a true maestro of this art in the show, it\u2019s A. E. Foringer. Foringer, who trained with the muralist Edwin Blashfield, had his 15 minutes of fame with \u201cThe Greatest Mother in the World,\u201d a Madonna-like Red Cross poster from 1918 \u2014 the only work mentioned in his 1948 obituary in The New York Times, Mr. Tomasko noted a bit forlornly.But Foringer also had a long career as a vignette artist for American Bank Note, creating images that appeared on more than 50 international bills and many stock certificates, including a series for the Canadian Bank of Commerce in the 1910s and 1920s that Mr. Tomasko calls \u201cthe most beautiful bank notes of the 20th century.\u201dMr. Tomasko acquired some of the large oil paintings Foringer made after American Bank Note sold the bulk of its archives at auction in 1990. Most of the original artwork Foringer did for the company is lost, but the engravings made from them have not entirely disappeared. The seated woman with grapes shown on a different Canadian Bank of Commerce note, a five-pound bill issued by its branch in Kingston, Jamaica, shown above, appears today on the label of the Maiden, a cabernet produced by Harlan Estate, a Napa Valley winery that has resurrected two Foringer engravings.In 1874, the New York Stock Exchange began requiring that all listed companies have their securities engraved by a reputable banknote company. The exhibition includes many examples, which themselves provide a kind of pictorial view of changes in the nature of American capitalism.The trains and steam engines of the 19th century gave way to sometimes amusingly anachronistic allegorical figures (like a 1936 Foringer vignette showing a woman in neo-Classical drapery holding a telephone); in turn those gave way to a style Mr. Tomasko calls \u201ccapitalist realism.\u201d The 1986 certificate for the Great American Savings Bank shown here features a quartet of ordinary workers by the artist Robert Lavin, including what Mr. Tomasko said was probably the first image of an African-American professional used on a financial instrument.The stock market boom of the 1980s and \u201990s was good for the picture engraving business. But other shifts in the economy \u2014 including the rise of the tech-company-heavy Nasdaq exchange, which did not require engravings \u2014 finally caught up. In 2001, the New York Stock Exchange dropped its engraving requirements, dealing what Mr. Tomasko called \u201ca final blow\u201d to nongovernmental security engraving in the United States.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a company that issued a stock certificate given to Mr. Tomasko by his grandmother. It is the Marmon Motor Car Company, not Merman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Fall of Gorsuch\u2019s Mother, a Painful Lesson in Politicking", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThose early years shaped his views on the law and life and provided a searing lesson in the realities of the political world. Despite the family ordeal, friends and relatives said, he emerged from the crucible of his youth tempered about politics yet not soured on public service. He decided to pursue goals similar to his mother\u2019s if only by a different path.\u201cIt was an example to him of what the realpolitik of Washington could be like,\u201d said Richard M. Segal, a Harvard Law School classmate who is now a lawyer in San Diego. \u201cHe viewed his mother as an environmentalist, and his mother viewed herself as an environmentalist. And meanwhile she was made the poster child of the view that the Reagan administration was just out there to rape the environment.\u201dThe teenager was his mother\u2019s conscience. \u201cNeil knew from the beginning the seriousness of my problems,\u201d she wrote in a memoir before her death in 2004. He was \u201csmart as a whip\u201d and \u201chad an unerring sense of fairness, as do many people his age.\u201d When she resigned, \u201che was really upset.\u201dBy most accounts, he did not dwell on it later in life, but it clearly echoed in his work. In preparing a moot court brief at Harvard on workplace safety, he tried to add material concerning the E.P.A. that did not fit, recalled a classmate, Ellen M. Bublick, who is now a law professor at the University of Arizona. In his time as an appeals court judge in Denver, his most notable writings have concerned the power of government regulators.\u201cWe talked about that prior history in relation to that,\u201d Professor Bublick said. \u201cHe definitely was proud of his mom and had a sense that in the Reagan era certain people took a fall for him in order to protect him. And I think that was really his view of what happened to his mom.\u201dNeil McGill Gorsuch\u2019s earliest years were spent in the West, where at Rocky Mountain campsites and fishing streams he internalized a faith in rugged individualism.He grew up in a three-bedroom ranch-style house in the east Denver neighborhood of Hilltop. His parents, Anne and David Gorsuch, were lawyers who had three children: Neil in 1967, Stephanie in 1969 and J.J. in 1973. His mother raised them Catholic; his father was not religious. (Judge Gorsuch is now Episcopalian, according to his brother, possibly inspired by his time studying at Oxford University.)Studious but not standoffish, Neil shared a bedroom with his brother and attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic school. Relatives and friends recalled him lugging stacks of books and once rounding the baseball diamond in well-worn cowboy boots after leaving his athletic shoes at home. \u201cIf anybody was going to be the president, it was going to be Neil Gorsuch,\u201d said Gina Carbone, 49, a classmate.She rose quickly. \u201cShe was very prominent in the shaping of policy,\u201d said Steve Durham, a leader of the House Crazies. She had a \u201cknack and ability to get along with people and put them at ease.\u201d But she was famously tough. The Rocky Mountain News wrote that she \u201ccould kick a bear to death with her bare feet.\u201dBy the time Ms. Gorsuch moved to Washington in 1981, she was headed for a divorce, and the children toggled between the capital and Colorado. It was an adjustment for children used to the informal ways of the West.\u201cAll of a sudden we were across the country, having to dress up in coats and ties and having to act like grown-ups at prep school,\u201d said Michael Trent, a Californian whose father was deputy transportation secretary at the time and who found in Mr. Gorsuch a similar spirit.The two boys took walks after dinner discussing the world. \u201cThe two of us were huge fans of Reagan,\u201d said Mr. Trent, who was later best man at Judge Gorsuch\u2019s wedding and made the judge godfather to his children. \u201cAnd it was because of our family upbringings. It was so much a part of our lives at the time.\u201dMr. Gorsuch soon had a stepfather when his mother married Mr. Burford, whom she had met in the State Legislature.Known for wearing furs and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, Ms. Gorsuch became a prominent face of the new administration as she cut back lawsuits against polluters and tried to relax parts of the Clean Air Act.\u201cThere was obviously a lot of controversy regarding her work as she was carrying out the president\u2019s program,\u201d Ed Meese, a top Reagan adviser, recalled. \u201cI\u2019m sure that undoubtedly had an impact on her son.\u201dJ.J. Gorsuch, 43, now a vice president of a Denver marketing technology company, said his mother\u2019s political life had shaped the family psyche but ultimately made his brother stronger. \u201cIf anything, it probably prepared him for the experience ahead in a great way,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows better than most how ugly the political process might get. So in that sense it\u2019s hopefully prepared him for the nomination process.\u201dHis mother emerged from her 1983 resignation demoralized about Washington, which she called \u201ctoo small to be a state but too large to be an asylum for the mentally deranged.\u201d But if her tribulations scarred him, Judge Gorsuch gave little indication while at Georgetown Preparatory School, a well-heeled Jesuit school outside Washington.His classmates \u2014 many the children of politicians themselves \u2014 knew the family connection, said Bill Hughes, son of a Democratic congressman, but left it unmentioned. As Mr. Trent said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what a difficult thing it would have been to go through that, but he never let it show.\u201dJudge Gorsuch focused on schoolwork and excelled at debate, competing nationally. \u201cEven as a kid, he would be able to step back from situations and be able to make judgments about them,\u201d said Stephen Ochs, a history teacher. \u201cHe had the ability to be curious and look at both sides without being threatened.\u201dHis conservative identity was already forming. The school yearbook jokingly listed him as founder of a \u201cFascism Forever\u201d club, which an editorial note clarified \u201chappily jerked its knees against the increasingly \u2018left-wing\u2019 tendencies of the faculty.\u201d Mr. Trent called that \u201csort of his little dig getting back\u201d at a teacher with whom he disagreed.His views apparently cost him little among his peers, who elected him student president. Classmates speculated that his poise would lead to the law and perhaps politics, said one classmate, Brian Cashman, who is now general manager of the New York Yankees. \u201cHe looked the part and acted the part.\u201dJudge Gorsuch arrived at Columbia in 1985 as the historically liberal university was recovering from student protests the previous spring and beginning to divest from corporations operating in South Africa. In three years on campus \u2014 he graduated a year early \u2014 he emerged as the intellectual leader of a resurgent right. It was \u201ca happy band of dissenters,\u201d as Brian Domitrovic, a classmate and fellow conservative, put it.His eloquence impressed many. That he was tall, clean cut and handsome only helped. He danced and drank Manhattans and martinis, Mr. Domitrovic said. He joined Phi Gamma Delta, a fraternity with a reputation for partying, and quietly attended religious services.But principally, Judge Gorsuch became known as a fierce and lucid writer in the Columbia Daily Spectator, where he published columns, and later The Federalist Paper, which he helped found. Part newspaper, part opinion journal, The Federalist Paper drew comparisons to the conservative Dartmouth Review.\u201cThere was a two-party system at Columbia in the \u201980s: the liberals and the socialists,\u201d said Stephen Later, who worked on the paper. \u201cThe Fed was a response to this echo chamber.\u201dJudge Gorsuch was out of step with campus zeitgeist. He bristled at attempts to bar military recruiting on campus, minimized the Iran-contra affair and dismissed a shantytown built on campus to protest South African apartheid. The main subject that animated his writing was the political hegemony he perceived at the university. A \u201ctyrannical atmosphere of \u2018ideas,\u2019\u201d he called it in February 1987. \u201cThere is little or no room at Columbia for dissenting voices: one is either Right or Wrong, Moral or Immoral, Compassionate or Heartless.\u201dIn March 1987, as students debated the fraternity system\u2019s treatment of women and minorities, Judge Gorsuch co-wrote a piece defending all-male clubs. In a familiar rhetorical move, he reframed the issue as free speech. In their \u201cheavy handed moralism,\u201d he wrote, the system\u2019s critics missed \u201cthe fact that Columbia is a pluralistic university, that its fraternity is equally pluralistic, with options available for everyone.\u201dThat spring, as students boycotted Coors beer, posters on campus alleged that The Federalist Paper, which accepted the company\u2019s advertising, had received funding from the Heritage Foundation, financed by the Coors family. Mr. Gorsuch mocked the \u201cprofessional protesters\u201d who had created the posters, and he threatened a libel suit.\u201cHe had a real regal way of writing about this stuff that made us look small,\u201d said Tom Kamber, a leader of the liberals. \u201cHis role was really to write these screeds that would try to take the winds out of our sails.\u201dThe battle continued at Harvard Law School, where Judge Gorsuch arrived in 1988 along with a young man from Chicago named Barack Obama. The two did not intersect much \u2014 Mr. Obama was six years older \u2014 but they mirrored each other as intellectual leaders who managed to disagree without being disagreeable. \u201cNeil was not quite as public a person as Barack was, but at the same time, for the people who knew him, he was very well respected,\u201d said Mr. Segal, the classmate.Young conservatives were inspired as the Soviet Union and its empire collapsed. \u201cIt was an incredibly optimistic time, and it was a time when a lot of us developed a strong belief in the power of free markets and rule of law,\u201d said Ken Mehlman, another classmate who went on to become chairman of the Republican National Committee.Harvard was the epicenter of a debate over whether the Constitution was a living document to be interpreted in evolving times or a neutral, unchanging charter judged by its original text. \u201cIt was a pretty contentious time at Harvard Law School,\u201d said Adam H. Charnes, a classmate. \u201cThere were conservatives who were provocateurs. He wasn\u2019t anything like that.\u201dJudge Gorsuch befriended liberals, including Norm Eisen, later a White House aide and ambassador under Mr. Obama. \u201cHe stood out among the conservative group in not being loud,\u201d Mr. Eisen said. \u201cHe managed to stay above that while making his conservative positions clear. I thought it was impressive.\u201dThrough all of this, Judge Gorsuch made little mention of his famous mother. Indeed, one friend who stayed close after law school said he had realized the relationship only years later.

{"Headline": "Gorsuch Must Condemn Trump\u2019s Attack on a Judge", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJudge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, must publicly condemn the president\u2019s attack on the judge who blocked his immigration order. Judge Gorsuch\u2019s sterling credentials notwithstanding, his supporters in the legal community should withdraw their backing for his nomination if he fails to do so.After Judge James Robart\u2019s ruling Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Mr. Trump may be right that the order will be stayed or overturned \u2014 the legal merits are tricky, and Judge Robart has not heard full briefing of them yet. But the attack on Judge Robart\u2019s integrity is indefensible.Federal judges have frustrated American presidents since the founding. Thomas Jefferson fulminated against judicial overreach and tried to get a Supreme Court justice impeached. Andrew Jackson disregarded a judicial order from the Supreme Court, Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court with his own appointees after it blocked many of his New Deal reforms. In his 2010 State of the Union address, President Obama criticized an opinion of the Supreme Court on campaign finance reform in front of some of the justices.But, by and large, presidents have respected the federal judiciary. As far as I know, no president has publicly challenged the integrity of a judge who has ruled against him. Mr. Trump, as in so many other cases, has broken new ground.His attack on Judge Robart comes at a fraught moment. During Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, his reckless statements were dismissed by his supporters as mere rhetoric. When Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel ruled against him in the Trump University case, Mr. Trump called him a \u201ctotal disgrace\u201d and accused him of bias because he was \u201cMexican\u201d (actually, an American citizen of Mexican descent). It might have been barely possible to see this offensive statement as red meat for the base rather than a considered judgment about the integrity of the federal judiciary. Not anymore.Now that Mr. Trump is president, his words matter. When federal judges in New York, Virginia and Massachusetts initially blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban a week ago, reports emerged that border agents disobeyed the courts or obeyed only grudgingly. Whatever happened, Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on Judge Robart\u2019s integrity could encourage executive branch officials to disregard other judicial orders, and will further inflame people\u2019s distrust of border agents, whether they do or not.Worse, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he regards any judge who thwarts his designs as a personal enemy. If Judge Robart\u2019s order reaches the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit, the appellate judges will need to worry that if they reverse Judge Robart, they will be seen by the public as validating Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on the district judge, further damaging the judiciary\u2019s reputation for impartiality. If they uphold his order, Mr. Trump may attack them as well. Whatever they do, the damage has been done. And this could happen again and again as Mr. Trump pushes through his program.True, the government has complied with Judge Robart\u2019s order for the time being. Mr. Trump\u2019s remark shows his typical Machiavellian shrewdness. By merely insulting the judge, rather than threatening to disobey him, he is testing the waters. If the public approves of the attack, Mr. Trump will be goaded forward to explicit disobedience. In the face of silence, he may hesitate. Only sustained opprobrium can prevent repetition.This brings us to Judge Gorsuch. He is the only judge in whom the president has publicly expressed confidence \u2014 by nominating him to a judicial position. A rebuke from Judge Gorsuch would be a stinging blow. It would, or at least might, protect the judiciary from further attacks from Mr. Trump for years to come.On the merits, Mr. Gorsuch is a shoo-in for the Supreme Court. He is a widely respected judge, praised for his integrity and independence. Normally, we do not expect a nominee to take a position on political issues, or to comment on pending cases, which could force him to recuse himself on the court.And Judge Gorsuch should not take a position on whether the president\u2019s immigration order is unlawful, or make political arguments of any kind. What he should do is stand up for the judiciary. He should declare that the president of the United States should not attack the integrity of a sitting judge.This is hardly a political statement. It is a view about the Constitution, one that Judge Gorsuch has already expressed in a judicial opinion:The framers lived in an age when judges had to curry favor with the crown in order to secure their tenure and salary and their decisions not infrequently followed their interests. Indeed, the framers cited this problem as among the leading reasons for their declaration of independence. \u2026 To this day, one of the surest proofs any nation enjoys an independent judiciary must be that the government can and does lose in litigation before its \u2018own\u2019 courts like anyone else.Right you are, Judge Gorsuch. Now say it again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s State of the City Has Critics Asking: What About Schools?", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe did not mention that black and Hispanic students still graduate from high school at far lower rates than their white and Asian counterparts \u2014 64.6 percent and 63.5 percent, compared with 80 percent and 83.3 percent. Or that only half of the students who do graduate are prepared for college-level work, according to the standards of the City University of New York. Nor did he argue for the importance of renewing mayoral control of schools, which is set to lapse on July 1 if Albany does not extend it, or of the state providing the city the additional $1.6 billion in annual school funding that it is owed under a 2006 court ruling.There was not a word about his $760 million school turnaround program, known as Renewal.Aaron Pallas, a professor of sociology and education at Columbia University Teachers College, said he interpreted the decision to focus the speech narrowly on affordable housing and jobs as an effort to target the economic concerns that appear to be foremost in the minds of voters in the city and nationally.But he said it could also reflect that the mayor doesn\u2019t have a distinct vision for the schools heading into a possible second term.In Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first term, the prekindergarten expansion, which he first proposed as a mayoral candidate, was \u201cclearly the major policy to be implemented, and I think that has been successful,\u201d Professor Pallas said. \u201cBut in other respects I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a very clear agenda with regard to the direction of the school system.\u201dMr. de Blasio campaigned for mayor in 2013 promising a sharp change from the education policies of his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg. The Bloomberg administration had pursued an aggressive agenda of closing struggling schools and opening new schools. In total, his administration closed 157 schools and opened 656.A spokeswoman for the mayor, Freddi Goldstein, called the idea that the administration lacked a clear educational agenda \u201cabsurd\u201d and said that the graduation rate and the dropout rate, which fell to its lowest level ever last year, 8.5 percent, reflected the fruits of the administration\u2019s investments in education. She noted that the college readiness rate had also improved to its highest level ever last year \u2014 37.2 percent of students who began high school in 2012 were considered ready \u2014 and that the number of students taking and passing Advanced Placement courses had also increased.But even people who generally support the mayor\u2019s approach to education said they were surprised by how little he discussed it in the speech.\u201cThe mayor has talked a lot about New York being a sanctuary city, but there\u2019s been little to no talk about what that means for New York City schools,\u201d she said. \u201cI definitely expected to hear something along those lines and there was nothing.\u201dMr. Gonzales said that at a time when \u201cthere are a lot of very concerning things happening at the federal level\u201d with regards to education, many people were looking to cities to offer an alternative vision.\u201cIt was just disappointing to see that he didn\u2019t make a bigger attempt to articulate what a just education system would look like,\u201d he said.Others were harsher.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that NYC kids won\u2019t be able to take advantage of Mayor de Blasio\u2019s 100,000 new jobs because just 37 percent of them are prepared for college,\u201d Jeremiah Kittredge, the group\u2019s chief executive, said in an emailed statement.Ms. Goldstein, the mayor\u2019s spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that the investigation was continuing and that when it was completed the city would report its findings to the State Education Department. She would not say when that would be.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of the New York City schools chancellor.

{"Headline": "600 Miles in a Coffin-Shaped Bus, Campaigning Against Death Itself", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "FeatureZoltan Istvan ran for president with a modest goal in mind: human immortality.Supported byThis man\u2019s name was Zoltan Istvan, and I had known him for about a year and a half by the time he began his progress across the country, from the Bay Area, where he lived, to Florida, and thence northward to Washington, where he planned to ascend Capitol Hill and, in coy allusion to Martin Luther\u2019s delivery of his 95 Theses, affix a Transhumanist Bill of Rights to the great ornate bronze door of the Rotunda.For transhumanists, this could only be conceived of as a rhetorical question, the obvious answer to which was a resounding yes. I had spent the previous 18 months immersed in this diffuse and heterogeneous movement, through which I encountered many forms of radical optimism about the potential for technology to transform the human condition, to improve our bodies and minds to the point that we become something better \u2014 something other than the animals we are. I met scientists who were convinced of the possibility and necessity of converting our minds into code, of uploading them into machines. I visited a cryonics facility outside Phoenix, in which the severed heads of the faithful were stored in liquid nitrogen, in the hope that future scientific innovations would permit their eventual return to life. I spent several nights in a basement in Pittsburgh with a group of self-proclaimed cyborgs who designed and built human-enhancement technologies for subdermal implantation. And I met a great many believers in what is known as \u201cthe technological Singularity,\u201d a messianic prophesy of our coming merger with machines, most famously advanced by Ray Kurzweil, a director of engineering at Google.I first met Istvan at a transhumanist conference in Piedmont, Calif., in the spring of 2014. He was handsome in an irrefutable and yet somehow unserious fashion, like a life-size Ken doll or a proof-of-concept for an Aryan eugenic ideal. I recognized right away that he was not a typical transhumanist. He was polite and charismatic and in no obvious sense geeky or awkward. He gave me a copy of a book he recently self-published called \u201cThe Transhumanist Wager,\u201d an unwieldy novel of ideas about a freelance philosopher named Jethro Knights who sails around the world to promote the need for life-extension research and winds up establishing a floating libertarian city-state called Transhumania \u2014 a regulation-free utopia of tech billionaires and rationalists \u2014 from which he wages an atheist holy war on a theocratic United States.A couple of days later, at a cafe in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, he told me of how the novel did not go over well with any of the 656 agents and publishers he sent it to over the previous year. He had spent over a thousand dollars, he said, on postage alone. The book\u2019s cover, which he designed himself, featured a greenish negative image of his own face, in profile, staring into the vacant sockets of a human skull.\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be like \u2018Hamlet,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, with the whole Yorick scene? With me facing the prospect of death and all that? But yeah, I\u2019m not sure it really works.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen worse book covers,\u201d I said, which for all I knew might have been the truth.He confided that his wife, Lisa, a gynecologist who worked for Planned Parenthood, recently started to express a keen interest in his doing something productive with his life. Lisa had just given birth to their second child and, what with the exponentially growing cost of living in the Bay Area, she was becoming increasingly concerned about the need to begin saving for their two daughters\u2019 educations. He explained to me that he was reluctant to fritter away money on such things, given that by the time the girls were in their late teens, it would be possible to upload the informational content of a Harvard or Yale degree directly to their brains and at a fraction of what such an education costs today.Lisa, he said, was largely tolerant of his views, but drew the line at gambling their children\u2019s futures on the fanciful notion of some imminent technological intervention.\u201cObviously she\u2019s a little resistant to transhumanist ideas,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause in the near future her entire profession will be obsolete. What with actual childbirth becoming a thing of the past. You know, with babies being produced by ectogenesis and whatnot.\u201dWhen, some months later, Istvan emailed me about his decision to run for president, I immediately called him. The first thing I asked was what his wife thought of the plan.\u201cWell, in a way,\u201d he said, \u201cit was Lisa who gave me the idea. Remember how I said she wanted me to do something concrete, get some kind of a proper job?\u201d\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m guessing running for president on the immortality platform was not what she had in mind.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cIt took a little while for her to come around to the idea.\u201d\u201cHow did you break it to her?\u201d\u201cI left a note on the refrigerator,\u201d he said, \u201cand went out for a couple hours.\u201d\u201cRoen Horn,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to live forever?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure that I do,\u201d I said, feeling the slender bones of his hand as I received it in my own.\u201cWell, why not?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to die? Do you think death is a good thing?\u201d\u201cThese are tricky questions,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I think about them on the bus and get back to you?\u201dThis Roen Horn, I learned as we walked down the eerily deserted main street, was a volunteer for Istvan\u2019s campaign, a zealous advocate of radical life extension who was also making a documentary about the Immortality Bus. The vehicle in question was, at the moment, moored in the parking lot of a nearby Bank of America. The immediate plan, Istvan told me, was to drive out into the desert to the White Sands Missile Range, where he intended to stage a protest highlighting the need to divert public money away from weapons spending and into life extension.The Wanderlodge was an even odder spectacle than I had anticipated: a great brown absurdity with the words IMMORTALITY BUS WITH TRANSHUMANIST ZOLTAN ISTVAN neatly hand-painted in white across the length of its midsection. On the rear of the bus were painted the words SCIENCE VS. THE COFFIN. A construction of inward-slanting wooden boards, also brown, was affixed to the roof, on top of which rested an elaborate arrangement of synthetic flowers. The effect of all this was not uncoffin-like, but it helped if you already knew what you were supposed to be looking at.Within were all the trappings and creature comforts of a midrange 1970s bachelor pad: a kitchenette equipped with ice machine and microwave oven, a dining table, ample bench-style seating for on-road lounging and, toward the rear, two narrow bunks and a bathroom (nonfunctional). Orange shag carpeting featured throughout.The thing was road-worthy, more or less, as long as you didn\u2019t drive it uphill at too steep a gradient and as long as you pulled over every 90 minutes or so to refill the motor oil, which leaked out the side at a truly alarming rate. This steady leakage was a concern for Istvan, not just with respect to the long-term health prospects of the Immortality Bus but more urgently the likelihood of our getting pulled over on the freeway by a traffic cop \u2014 something that, given the conspicuousness of the vehicle, seemed a nontrivial prospect.The difficulties began about half an hour outside Las Cruces. As the freeway slung a wide loop around the jagged foothills of the Organ Mountains, the sound of the engine, striving to haul us uphill, had become a shrill rasp. We were maxing out at about 35 m.p.h., and Istvan\u2019s hulking form was bent low over the wheel, as he eyed the dashboard\u2019s archaic array of mysterious dials.\u201cWe look to be overheating pretty bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this far into the red. And this isn\u2019t even a particularly big hill. We could have a problem here, gentlemen.\u201dUpward trajectories were best avoided, he explained, on account of a cruel paradox at work in the ancient mechanics of the Wanderlodge: The longer you went uphill, the harder the engine had to strain to move the bus at even a sluggish pace; and the slower you went, the less air circulated from outside to cool the engine, thereby perpetuating the cycle of overheating.We crested the hill and began to pick up speed on the downward slope. The engine\u2019s whining descended somewhat in pitch, and I was newly confident that we were no longer about to grind to a halt in the desolate heat of the desert.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d I said.\u201cActually,\u201d Istvan said in a cheerful tone, \u201cit\u2019s far more dangerous coming downhill, because we\u2019re relying on 40-year-old brake pads here.\u201dAlthough I was not sure I wanted to live forever, I was sure that I didn\u2019t want to go down in a blaze of chintzy irony, plunging into a ravine strapped into the passenger seat of a thing called the Immortality Bus. For all that Istvan railed against the tyranny of death over human lives, his attitude toward basic road safety was at times wildly cavalier. The fact that he was piloting a 38-foot coffin bus through New Mexico did not, for instance, stop him from looking at his phone every couple of minutes, responding to texts and emails, checking the social-media analytics on his latest piece for TechCrunch, etc.Between the driver and passenger seats there was a large, raised, shag-pile-carpeted area, which I was using to lay out my various writerly impedimenta: voice recorder, notebook, pens and so forth. This, it turned out, housed the Wanderlodge\u2019s engine. At one point, Istvan decided that it might ameliorate the overheating issues if he opened this up to \u201clet the engine breathe.\u201d As soon as we lifted the lid of this housing, the whole interior was quickly transformed into a hellish, hurtling sauna, heated by the searing petroleum fumes that emanated from the roaring shag-pile maw of the open engine unit.\u201cI know it\u2019s not pleasant!\u201d bellowed Istvan over the near-deafening roar of the engine, \u201cbut it\u2019s really helping with the overheating!\u201dAt length we pulled over to let the engine cool awhile, and Istvan went outside to change the oil. Horn was recumbent on the long couch to the rear of the driver\u2019s seat, staring impassively at the ceiling, his hands cradling the back of his head. This was to become his default attitude throughout the trip.I craned around in my seat and asked him how he wound up volunteering for Istvan\u2019s campaign.\u201cI just really don\u2019t want to die,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that would suck more than being dead. So I\u2019m just doing what I can to ensure that life-extension science gets the funding it needs.\u201d\u201cSo what is it you do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI mean workwise. When you\u2019re not volunteering for Zoltan.\u201d\u201cI run the Eternal Life Fan Club,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an online organization for people who are serious about living forever. Not, like, 500 years like a lot of transhumanists. Forever.\u201dHorn was 28, he said, and lived in Sacramento with his father, a recently retired insurance-claims adjuster, and his mother, who worked in a movie theater. His parents were Christians, his father a Calvinist who believed in eternal life in paradise for the elect and in eternal damnation for the unchosen. He was especially vocal in his conviction that his atheist son was destined for the infernal torments of hell.\u201cHow does he feel about this whole Immortality Bus thing?\u201d I asked.\u201cHe\u2019s actually O.K. with it,\u201d Horn said. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s cool I\u2019m getting to be on TV news and all.\u201dJust past the security checkpoint at the entrance to the facility, there was a kind of open-air munitions exhibit that featured a squat replica of the Fat Man, along with dozens of other decommissioned rockets and bombs. In the undulating heat of the desert, these slender tilted obelisks loomed like the inscrutable monuments of an ancient thanatopia, a henge of metal phalluses thrusting skyward in ecstatic communion with the cosmic powers. Istvan removed from his backpack a banner he had printed for the occasion and, positioning himself in front of one of the larger rockets, instructed Horn to take a series of photographs of him bearing the rolled-out message: TRANSHUMANIST PARTY PREVENTS EXISTENTIAL RISK. The intention of the protest, if you could really call it that, was to create a series of images and short videos to be uploaded to Istvan\u2019s various social-media accounts and shared among his many thousands of followers. Leaning self-consciously against the Fat Man replica, I scribbled in my notepad. Horn took out his phone and filmed a six-second Vine video of Istvan saying: \u201cStop nuclear war! It\u2019s a devastating existential risk!\u201d Then he filmed Istvan giving another brief speech on the central theme of his campaign: the need to divert government spending away from war and into research on life extension.Later that evening, we pulled off the Interstate and checked into a motel. As I stood in the doorway, waiting for Istvan and Horn to get their stuff from the Wanderlodge, I browsed through a stand of leaflets by the entrance. Most of these advertised sites of general touristic interest \u2014 for instance, PistachioLand, \u201chome of the world\u2019s largest pistachio\u201d \u2014 but there was also a small assortment of Christian pamphlets, and of these I selected one that was simply titled \u201cEternity.\u201d It was a prospectus of the apocalypse, published by an outfit called the Gospel Tract and Bible Society. Standing in the empty lobby of the motel, I read of God\u2019s decree that all things shall cease to exist \u2014 that \u201cthe heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up\u201d \u2014 and I thought again of the unearthly monument I had walked around that day, the ceremonial circle with its ranged machineries of death.Reading on, I learned how I, or my soul, might survive the death of my body and all other worldly things by surrendering myself to the Lord. I remembered asking Horn, earlier that day, about how his religious upbringing might have informed his belief that he would live forever through science. He said there was no longer any need for gods.\u201cScience is the new God,\u201d he said. \u201cScience is the new hope.\u201dHorn, with his Calvinist background, seemed to me now a walking illustration of the way in which scientific progress had displaced divine providence as our culture\u2019s locus of faith. He embodied, in fact, the religious dimension of transhumanism: a movement that, in its grand mythos of the coming Singularity, maintains a Christian distaste for the flesh and its frailties. Its delirious eschatology foretells a final unity with the technological divine, through which the elect will make the transition from time into eternity.Istvan, by contrast, had come to transhumanism from a more secular, hedonic background. In his 20s, having graduated from Columbia University with a degree in philosophy and religion, he fixed up an old yacht and set out to circumnavigate the globe. He funded his trip partly by making short documentaries for the National Geographic Channel about the remote places he was visiting. Somewhere along the way, he invented an extreme sport called volcano boarding (basically snowboarding, except you do it on the slopes of an active volcano). While reporting on the large number of buried land mines still remaining in Vietnam\u2019s former DMZ, Istvan himself came very close to stepping on one; his guide tackled him from behind as he was walking and brought him to the ground just inches from where an unexploded mine was jutting from the earth.In the narrative he had constructed about his life, this was the moment he became a transhumanist \u2014 the moment he became consumed by an obsession with mortality, with the unacceptable fragility of human existence. He returned to California to set up a real estate business and, taking full advantage of the permissive finance culture of those years, bought and flipped a number of properties in quick succession. He hated the work, but he was good at it and made quite a lot of money very quickly. Right before the crash in 2008, he sold half his portfolio and came out of the deal a millionaire. Forty years after his own parents fled communist Hungary, he had become the embodiment of an American capitalist ideal: the immigrant son with a weird European name who became an honest-to-God self-made millionaire. It hadn\u2019t even been that hard. The money was enough to enable him to quit his job and to dedicate himself to the possibility, and the necessity, of achieving immortality through science.He was a transhumanist ascetic, a young man who had largely withdrawn from the world so that he might never have to leave it. He had placed his faith in the idea of \u201clongevity escape velocity,\u201d the popular transhumanist notion that the pace of advancement in the science of life extension would eventually accelerate to the point that, for every year that passes, average human-life expectancy increases by more than a year. Horn told me that, in his parents\u2019 house in Sacramento, he slept on the floor of his bedroom, partly because he didn\u2019t want to buy a bed when what little money he had might better be spent on supporting life-extension research, but mainly because of a distaste for soft surfaces. (This self-avowed aversion was roundly contradicted by his near-fanatical dedication to couch-based recumbence, as outlined above.)\u201cI have to admit,\u201d I said, \u201cI find this whole immortality thing difficult to get behind. Doesn\u2019t your obsession with living eternally actually amount to your being totally imprisoned by death?\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut aren\u2019t we all? Isn\u2019t that kind of the whole idea?\u201d I told him that I took his point, and we both laughed, a little awkwardly perhaps, and ate our lunches in silence for a while, listening in on Istvan\u2019s terse exchange with his wife.It was late October, and the truck stop was lavishly bedecked with the ghoulish paraphernalia of the season \u2014 plastic jack-o\u2019-lanterns, cotton spider webs, wall-mounted witches on broomsticks and other festive gewgaws. Dangling from the ceiling directly behind Horn\u2019s head was a rubber statuette of Death itself, the skeletal form shrouded in a ragged black cowl, a plastic scythe clutched in its bony little hand. This cartoonish figurine twirled slowly on its nylon string, distracting me with its overblown enactment of bargain-basement foreshadowing.\u201cI just want to have fun forever,\u201d Horn said at length, guiding a forkful of dry salad leaves toward his pale face. \u201cThe 20 years I get from eating the way I do could be the difference between my dying and my getting to longevity escape velocity. I\u2019m holding off on pleasure now so that I can have more pleasure later. I\u2019m actually a total hedonist.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem even slightly like a hedonist to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t drink, you don\u2019t take drugs. You barely eat. To be honest, you seem like a medieval monk.\u201dHorn cocked his head to one side, gave the idea some consideration. I didn\u2019t want to raise the topic of sex, but it seemed to hang there, twirling slowly above our heads like the rubber avatar of Death. I didn\u2019t have to, as it turned out: Horn brought it up himself.\u201cYou know one really cool thing about being alive in the future?\u201d he asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cSexbots.\u201d\u201cSexbots.\u201d\u201cYou know, like A.I. robots that are built for having sex with.\u201d\u201cOh, sure,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of sexbots. It\u2019s a nice-enough idea. You really think that\u2019s going to happen, though?\u201d\u201cFor sure,\u201d Horn said, closing his eyes and nodding beatifically, in momentary reflection upon some distant exaltation. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m very much looking forward to.\u201dHe had a particular way of smiling that was half evasion and half challenge. Out of context, you might be tempted to describe it as smug, but the effect was somehow deeply endearing.\u201cThe problem I have with sexbots,\u201d I said, \u201cis why wouldn\u2019t you just have sex with an actual person? I mean, all things being equal.\u201dHe said: \u201cAre you kidding me? A real girl could cheat on you, sleep around. You could get an S.T.D. You could maybe even die.\u201d\u201cIs that potentially a bit alarmist?\u201d\u201cNo way, man. It happens literally all the time. See, a personal sexbot would never cheat on you, and it would be just like a real girl.\u201dHe said nothing for a time and drank at leisure from his glass of water. He consumed some further forkfuls of salad. He gazed out the window at the parking lot full of trucks, the Interstate beyond, the ever-present vultures hanging in the air.I said, \u201cDo you mind me asking if you\u2019ve had bad experiences with people cheating on you?\u201d\u201cI have so far abstained from sex,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never had a girlfriend.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saving yourself for the sexbots?\u201dHe nodded slowly, shrewdly raising his eyebrows. You bet he was saving himself for the sexbots.\u201cFair enough,\u201d I said, raising my hands in capitulation. \u201cI hope you live that long.\u201dHe said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I will.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m good at, half-assing stuff,\u201d he told me one afternoon in the parking lot of a Walmart where we stopped to fill a cart with containers of motor oil and some barbecue trays to collect it as it leaked from the bus.I said I\u2019d begun to think of the Immortality Bus as the Entropy Bus, the three of us trundling across Texas in a great mobile metaphor for the inevitable decline of all things, the disintegration of all systems over time.\u201cEntropy sucks,\u201d Horn said.\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Istvan said. \u201cIt absolutely is what it is.\u201dThe question of futility, given the inexorable suckiness of entropy, was raised many times on the Wanderlodge. Istvan and Horn believed that life was rendered meaningless by death. If in the end everything was lost, they asked, what was the point of anything?I did not feel qualified to answer this question, but I tried to make a case for life as it currently stood, which meant trying to make a case for death. Wasn\u2019t it the fact that life ended, I asked, that gave it what meaning it had? Wasn\u2019t it the very fact that we were here for so brief a time, that we could be gone at any moment, that made life so intensely beautiful and terrifying and strange? (Then again, wasn\u2019t the idea of meaning itself an illusion, a necessary human fiction? If a finite existence was futile, wouldn\u2019t immortality be just a state of endless futility?)There was no beauty in finitude, they replied, no meaning to be extracted from oblivion. My arguments, Horn insisted, were transparently motivated by a \u201cdeathist\u201d ideology, a need to protect myself against the terror of death by trying to convince myself that death was actually not so terrible. As crazy as most of what Horn said sounded to me, he was, I thought, basically right about this.We drove through the emptiness. Now and then we passed a hand-painted sign standing in a field, a gesture of anonymous pride or defiance. A \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d A \u201cDeport Obama.\u201d A \u201cDon\u2019t Mess With Texas.\u201d Mostly, we passed roadkill. For miles at a stretch, the only landmarks were corpses: foxes, raccoons, armadillos in various states of putrefaction on the margins of the Interstate. Istvan swigged at intervals from a magnum-size vessel of greenish energy drink he picked up on our last Walmart stop. We talked for hours and then for hours more we said nothing at all. We listened to a Tom Petty greatest-hits cassette straight through, twice, three times. \u201cRunnin\u2019 down a dream,\u201d Petty sang, \u201cthat never would come to me.\u201d An hour later, he sang it again.About an hour east of Ozona, we pulled off the Interstate onto a narrow side road so that Istvan could remove the barbecue tray, which was by now almost overflowing with leaked oil. We were on the perimeter of a vast ranch, a flat and half-barren landscape of scrub grass and squat cactuses as far as the human eye could see. I went behind the bus to urinate, and as I did so I looked up and counted five vultures idling overhead, like predator drones in the inverted abyss of the sky. I tried to imagine how we might have appeared to the serene eyes of these primordial beasts, three medium-size mammals lumbering upright, without apparent purpose, around a great coffin-shaped leviathan. But what could any of this \u2014 men, coffins, journeys \u2014 possibly mean to these creatures, to whom nothing was required to mean anything? Being not yet dead, we were probably irrelevant to their view of the landscape.I struggled to remember some lines from the eighth of Rilke\u2019s Duino Elegies, in which he writes about the freedom in which animals live: \u201cthe Open\u201d upon which they look out but which is unavailable to our sight, oriented as we are always toward the overbearing presence of our own finitude. Back on the bus, I searched for the passage on my phone and found it: \u201cWe, only, can see death; the free animal/has its decline in back of it, forever,/and God in front, and when it moves, it moves/already in eternity, like a fountain.\u201dLater, as we barreled along the Interstate, Horn cheerfully drew our attention toward a gigantic billboard that read, \u201cIf you die today, where will you spend eternity?\u201d\u201cIn the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the ground.\u201dHe told me about an accident he had when he was 9. He fell from his bike, punctured his spleen and very nearly died from internal bleeding. There were weeks in the hospital, then a recovery; but a darkness was revealed to him, a black terror beneath the thin surface of the world. Every night, he awoke gasping from the same nightmare, in which he had died in his sleep, in which he felt himself lying there in his bed feeling nothing, an impossible body. Every night this same experience of a thing that could not be experienced, this same vision of a thing that could never be glimpsed. This was the beginning of his move away from the religion of his parents, he said, this vision of the nothingness that awaited him after death.We were standing on a lavishly tree-lined street in an upscale residential neighborhood in Austin where a campaign event was about to take place, and Istvan was being interviewed for local TV news. He was dressed in a shirt and slacks, his hair combed meticulously back from his high-domed forehead.\u201cI would agree that we are, in fact, trying to play God,\u201d he said.It was to me that he said this, or at any rate it was me he was looking at when he said it. The bearded and lavishly perspiring cameraman, who was double-jobbing as a reporter, had requested that I stand to one side of him as filmed; Istvan would, in this way, appear to be addressing a dedicated news reporter, rather than a guy who, presumably because of budget cuts, had been forced to do two jobs simultaneously.This was a thing that had been happening to me lately. I had started to see myself as a mechanism through which signals were passed. I would be sitting on the bus, jotting down snatches of conversation in my notebook, details of scenery or sensation, and I would see myself as a primitive device, a machine for the recording and processing of information. I would be at the checkout in a cavernous Walmart, paying for snacks, and I would see myself as one of many millions of mechanisms in a vast and mysterious system for the upward transfer of wealth. I knew, of course, that this was a result of my overexposure to mechanistic ideas, but on some level I recognized that I had always seen myself in this way.\u201cAnd what made you decide to run for president?\u201d asked the cameraman who was also a reporter.\u201cI believe,\u201d Istvan said, \u201cthat we should take technology as far as it can take us.\u201d His hand gestures had the practiced decisiveness of a real-deal politician; in the presence of the camera, as he gazed unblinkingly into my eyes, he had taken on a plausibly presidential aura. He seemed, suddenly, a vast physical presence, a great hollow monument to his own significance.\u201cAnd that includes,\u201d he said, \u201cbecoming technology ourselves. At some point, we are going to become more machines than human beings. That\u2019s what my presidential campaign is advocating for. That\u2019s the conversation I\u2019m trying to start.\u201dA cluster of young men approached us. They were part of an Austin biohacker group, and they were here for the campaign event. They had names like Alec, Avery and Shawn; they were, for transhumanists, a startlingly frat-brovian contingent, all laid-back Texan vibes, loosefitting vests, hypertrophied upper bodies.Horn received them in his usual manner, avoiding traditional greetings in favor of an immediate interrogation as to their stance on eternal life.\u201cI\u2019m down,\u201d said a guy named Alec, as though Horn had just asked him if he wanted to go in on a bag of weed. \u201cLet\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s make it happen. Life is awesome.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d Horn said. He glanced meaningfully at me, a look that I took as mild admonishment for previous exchanges in which I expressed reservations about absolute judgments on the awesomeness of life.We went into the house where the event was to take place, a small split-level open-plan that was almost entirely devoid of furniture. I was given to understand that the place was shared by a loose cohort of biohackers; it was not apparent who did and did not live there, but it seemed to be a kind of transhumanist commune or futurist frat house. Even for an event of this sort, the gathering was overwhelmingly male.We mingled for a while, and I drank some surprisingly potent home-brewed ale, and then Istvan delivered a fluent and apparently unscripted speech. History was being created, he said, with this movement, this campaign, which was not about getting votes but about raising awareness of the coming Singularity and the importance of living long enough to experience it.We hung around for an hour or so afterward, and at some point, Horn gave an impromptu speech of his own. He delivered this oration \u201cin character\u201d as a generic hipster, wearing a pair of black-framed glasses and a slightly strained knowing smirk on his face. This was a role he\u2019d been tinkering with in the videos he uploaded to the Eternal Life Fan Club\u2019s website over the course of the campaign.\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t mainstream,\u201d he said to the assembled biohackers, most of whom seemed mildly perplexed by the performance. \u201cYou still have your childlike imaginations. If you want to take your nonmainstreamness to the next level, you\u2019re gonna have to live forever. You know what the most mainstream thing ever is? Dying. Dying is totally mainstream. Being dead in the ground is totally mainstream. Vote for Zoltan if you want to live forever!\u201dI\u2019d seen this performance of Horn\u2019s before and had advised him that it was a little too broad in its depiction of the hipster trope, that it seemed like more of a caricature of a caricature than a representation of any actual person, and that, furthermore, the injection of performative irony into his delivery tended to obscure the absolute earnestness of his message. But right now, perhaps because of the unusually strong home-brew beer I was drinking, I was enjoying it immensely, and I felt a strange tenderness for him swelling in my chest, an almost fraternal instinct of protection, very much at odds with any properly journalistic imperatives.I agreed with practically nothing that came out of his mouth the entire time we spent together. He was as strange a person as I had ever met, and I had met a great many strange people in the year and a half I spent reporting on transhumanists. I found myself hoping that he would not be disillusioned, that he would maintain, as long as he lived, the sense of his own exemption from death. His very belief that existence was rendered meaningless by death was, I thought, precisely what seemed to afford his life a sense of purpose, a sense of direction. This, in the end, was why humans would always look for meaning and would always find it in some variety of religion. You do what you can with the strangeness of being here, for the time being.An hour or so later, we were in the backyard of an empty house on the far outskirts of the city, waiting for a cab to come and take us to our respective hotels. Istvan and I were downing the last of the Immortality Bus\u2019s booze stash. I was feeling a little lightheaded from the drinking, and from the small amount of weed I smoked at the party before remembering I hated smoking weed, and so I climbed down into the yard to take the air. The night was warm and fragrant and alive with the gentle chirping of crickets. I stared up at the stars, feeling pleasantly out of it. It was good to be outside, to be in the world, to be a living animal.The more I listened, the more urgent the chirping of the crickets seemed to become. I remembered then having read something in the news a couple of weeks earlier about a cricket infestation that had been particularly intense in the area around Austin. The swelling of the insects\u2019 numbers had to do with the summer\u2019s having been unusually wet. Now in the autumn, the cooling of the air had forewarned them, on some primordial level, of their own impending death. The chirping I was listening to, I now realized, was the sound of thousands of male animals expressing their urge to reproduce, an instinct made acute by their own approaching demise. The sound seemed to be intensifying and to be coming at once from everywhere and nowhere, to be generated by the night itself.I heard the buzz of Istvan\u2019s phone from across the yard. Our cabdriver calling, probably. I breathed in deeply, assimilating the warm and complicated air, the fragrant night. In my tipsy state, it seemed outright implausible that all of this would one day be beyond my reach, that one day I would die and never again breathe this air or hear these sounds \u2014 crickets, traffic, words, vibrating phones: the interwoven signals of animals and machines \u2014 or feel the hopeful surge of alcohol in my blood, the world advancing its uncertain promise. It seemed ludicrous to think that this was it: just this once, and never again.I heard the hollow slam of the Immortality Bus\u2019s door, and Istvan calling my name. Our cab had pulled up at the curb. I took a last look at the looming apparition of the bus, the great brown sarcophagus of the American highway, and was momentarily taken by the facile charm of its standing as a metaphor for life itself: an incomprehensible and futile journey, in a vast coffin-shaped recreational vehicle, out of one nowhere into some other. I walked toward the street, toward Istvan and Horn, deciding to tell them about this life-as-coffin-bus idea, and to tell them that I was glad to have been on this journey for a while, whatever it meant or did not mean. But by the time I got to the car and slid in beside Horn, Istvan was already sitting up front, passionately laying out the coordinates of the posthuman future to our cabdriver, and the moment had passed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Housing Solution: Lawyers for Tenants", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDefending yourself in court might work in old movies or on reality TV, when the stakes are small and the judge is named Judy.The city already spends $62 million annually on civil legal services for tenants, as part of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s larger push to preserve New York\u2019s housing affordability. (In an age of skyrocketing rents, keeping people from losing their homes can be as important as building new moderately priced apartments.) Mr. de Blasio would increase that amount each year over the next five years \u2014 from an additional $15 million in the 2018 fiscal year to an additional $93 million in the 2022 fiscal year, for a total of $155 million that year.The money is meant to guarantee free lawyers for tenants whose household incomes are below about $50,000 (for a family of four), and free legal counseling for those making more than that. It\u2019s a victory for tenants and for the City Council, including Councilman Mark Levine, who has championed \u201cright to counsel\u201d legislation for years.Early in his tenure, Mr. de Blasio reorganized the city\u2019s scattered legal services programs and put them under one agency, with more funding. Now, on the brink of a re-election campaign, he can make a case that the emphasis was smart \u2014 the city\u2019s existing legal services program has reduced evictions by 24 percent over two years \u2014 and that the increased financing will be money well spent.Even as affordable housing grows scarcer and the gentrification tide makes many New Yorkers feel doomed to dislocation, one weapon for tenants has always been obvious, if expensive: lawyers. Landlords have deeper pockets than tenants, and they are often vicious in the tactics they use to forcibly, often illegally, clear renters out for redevelopment and gentrification.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Her Team Is 0-24, but She Might Deserve Coach of the Year Honors", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 When the coach, Angela Jackson, phones a potential recruit, the response is surprise. Is there still a women\u2019s basketball team at Chicago State? Is there still a Chicago State?\u201cThe first question is, \u2018I thought y\u2019all were closed,\u2019\u201d Jackson said.It is a stinging query for this university, a vital institution that is on the eve of its 150th birthday, and that has served as a lifeline to low-income, mostly African-American students on Chicago\u2019s far South Side.Jackson is highly regarded as a coach. Her team went 24-10 in 2010-11. Her players are resilient. They play purposefully, without bickering. But they have not won in a year. Perseverance alone has not halted Division I\u2019s longest losing streak \u2014 defeats in all 24 games this season and seven at the end of last season, many on far-flung, budget-straining road trips in the Western Athletic Conference.A grim financial outlook at the university, and the fear that Chicago State would shut down last fall, scared off three recruits for this season. Two other players did not return to the team, Jackson said, worried that their majors might not be available.The starting center left school in early December, depleting the Cougars of their leading scorer, rebounder and shot blocker. The point guard tore a knee ligament. At times, Chicago State has taken the court with just six available players, one above the minimum. Jackson and her two assistants sometimes join practice so there will be enough bodies to complete drills or fill out a scrimmage.As the losses have mounted, Chicago State has encountered an opponent that can be as difficult to overcome as defeat: perception.\u201cIs it really as bad as they\u2019re making it sound?\u201d members of the freshman forward Alexandria Cliff\u2019s family ask her. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNot at all.\u201dYet the questions persist as Chicago State seeks to recover, reform and redefine itself athletically and academically.\u201cYou could make Geno Auriemma the head coach, and he\u2019s going to have the same problems without funding,\u201d said Bob Hallberg, a former men\u2019s basketball coach at Chicago State who is now the athletic director and women\u2019s coach at St. Xavier University in Chicago.While Auriemma has won 11 N.C.A.A. women\u2019s titles at Connecticut, Jackson, 48, has withstood exasperating circumstances in the most recent of her 14 seasons at Chicago State. Her dedication alone, said Doug Bruno, the longtime women\u2019s coach at DePaul University, ought to qualify her for national coach of the year \u201cas crazy as that sounds.\u201d\u201cTo not bail out, to stay the course through difficult times, is a testament to how good she is,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cShe could easily get a six-figure job as an assistant at a big-time program and have a much better job. I really admire what she does every single day.\u201dLike many public universities around the country, Chicago State faces substantial cutbacks in its state financing. A budget stalemate between the Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, and the Democratic-led legislature has lasted more than a year and a half.The standoff has left Chicago State with only emergency funding from the state, which historically provides 30 percent of its budget ($84 million for 2016-17).Only 86 freshmen enrolled last fall amid the financial crisis, dropping total registration in a single year to 3,578 students from 4,767. Then came the news that the six-year graduation rate for the 2009 freshman class was 11 percent.In a recent editorial, The Chicago Tribune said the school should explore a \u201cfull-blown takeover by a stronger university,\u201d perhaps the University of Illinois-Chicago. It cited Chicago State\u2019s frequent turnover in leadership, accusations of financial mismanagement, whistle-blower lawsuits and academic underperformance.The persistent negative publicity has left Chicago State officials and students feeling isolated and guarded, as if they needed to support one another because it was possible no one else would.In mid-January, though, Chicago State received what it considered encouraging news. The governor appointed four new members to the Board of Trustees and named an advisory group. The stated intent was to keep the university open and independent of a merger.Last spring, as 300 non-faculty employees, about a third of the work force, were laid off, Chicago State seemed to be asphyxiating, Lucy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, I\u2019m not worried about oxygen at all. It\u2019s plentiful.\u201dStill, in athletics, as with academics, the university is trying to catch its breath. Chicago State represents an acute example of the difficulties facing N.C.A.A. schools on the margins of Division I, as universities switch conferences in an unending, often futile chase for dollars, status and success.Without nearby rivals in the Western Athletic Conference, or WAC, Chicago State must take distant flights to Seattle, Phoenix, California, New Mexico, Utah and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. A number of the school\u2019s teams struggle to remain competitive. And there is no team to support the school\u2019s athletic department on broad financial shoulders.The athletic budget for 13 varsity teams is $5.6 million, officials said. (The Tribune reported that the working budget was cut to $2.8 million in 2015-16, which the university disputes.) In either case, Chicago State\u2019s entire athletic funding is far short of, say, the $9 million in salary and bonus pay that Jim Harbaugh receives to coach football at the University of Michigan.Currently, Chicago State has no full-time athletic director and only one publicist for all of its teams. Fliers posted around campus seek students interested in joining the golf and track teams.A wish list for sports facilities includes a new floor for the basketball practice gym, which the university budget committee says needs to be replaced \u201cfor safety.\u201dSarah Amalou, a guard from Denmark who returned home after the 2014-15 season, when she was a redshirt freshman, said that as budget troubles grew more severe, players seemed to get less equipment and did not receive meal money over Christmas break, forcing them to rely on what she called subpar food in the cafeteria. Motivation seemed to lag, she said.\u201cA lot of very competent people in the athletic department slowly quit their jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cThis indicated something was very wrong.Chicago State is clearly not a fit for the athletic conference, geographically or financially, said B. David Ridpath, an associate professor of sports business at Ohio University and president of the Drake Group, which urges reform in college athletics.Ridpath urged the university to explore another Division I conference, or consider downgrading athletics to Division II or III, in which the teams could play opponents in and near Chicago, cut costs and be competitive. The dropping of sports entirely, while honoring scholarships, should also be up for discussion, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad situation; you feel for those kids,\u201d Ridpath said. But by jettisoning athletics, he added, \u201cyou could certainly save a few million bucks.\u201d\u201cThat could be maybe a step in the right direction for righting the ship there,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I\u2019m not too optimistic that the university as a whole is going to survive.\u201dJeff Hurd, the WAC\u2019s commissioner, said in a statement that the conference was providing administrative guidance as Chicago State sought to remain a Division I school. But he stopped short of saying that the Cougars would remain in the league.Chicago State officials said they had no intention of dropping sports or leaving Division I. Instead, the university is exploring the idea of adding a non-scholarship football team, along with a marching band and club sports, in an attempt to attract more students from the Chicago public schools and enhance the university\u2019s brand.\u201cSports are going to play a central role in the revitalization of Chicago State University,\u201d said the Rev. Marshall E. Hatch Sr., the trustees\u2019 chairman.To drop sports would be a \u201ctravesty,\u201d denying opportunity for underserved students who might not have another chance to attend college, said Jackson, the coach.A native of Detroit who played basketball at Old Dominion University, she called Chicago State a \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d and said she had remained there through hard times because \u201csometimes you find your purpose in life.\u201d\u201cWe serve an African-American community, and I enjoy being the bridge from teenager to young adult,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important \u2014 those four to five years in those young ladies\u2019 lives are important.\u201dTo coach at Chicago State requires \u201ca clear picture of what things are and are not within your control,\u201d said Gloria Bradley, a former assistant to Jackson who left in August to become the head women\u2019s basketball coach at Beloit College in Wisconsin.\u201cShe\u2019s very honest and upfront with athletes and parents,\u201d Bradley said about Jackson. \u201cA level of trust is created when you keep them informed.\u201dWith a limited budget, a certain creativity is also required. For nonconference play, several so-called guarantee games are sought, with payments of up to $20,000 for a willingness to travel to play a higher-profile team.The nearest WAC rival, Missouri-Kansas City, is a 500-mile drive, so Chicago State must fly to all its conference games. Airline tickets are bought far in advance. One of Jackson\u2019s assistants negotiates hotel rates; it doesn\u2019t hurt if the breakfast buffet is free.Recruits are sought within driving distance. International players can be reached for the cost of a call on Skype. Jackson\u2019s recruiting pitch is direct: \u201cWe\u2019re still here. We\u2019re open, we\u2019re operating, we\u2019re looking to improve our basketball program. We want to make sure we get to the top echelon of the WAC conference. Come here and get a great education and graduate so when you\u2019re a huge success and a professional you can donate money back.\u201dIf she is wearing a shirt with the Chicago State colors and logo, Jackson said, she completes her pitch by looking at her shirt and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty difficult to close a whole university.\u201dCliff, the freshman forward from Manitowoc, Wis., accepted Chicago State\u2019s scholarship offer to play basketball and volleyball. She said the financial crisis did not enter into her decision.\u201cThey told me they had a good program, that I would be able to get my education paid for, so that\u2019s always a good thing,\u201d she said.But nothing about this season has been easy. Before practice began last fall, a dorm where a number of players lived had no hot water. Residents had to shower in the gym.Then, in early December, the team\u2019s best player, a 6-foot-2 center named Sh\u2019Toya Sanders, left school.On Nov. 22, she scored 38 points, grabbed 23 rebounds and blocked 5 shots in a defeat at Northern Illinois. She was named the WAC player of the week. Four games later, she had returned home to Fort Wayne, Ind.The reasons were complicated, Sanders said. She could not decide if she was playing basketball for herself or her family. She \u201cbumped heads a lot\u201d with Jackson. The school was not the right fit for her. A sense of futility accompanied the losing.\u201cNo matter how hard you played, you came out empty-handed,\u201d Sanders said.The team\u2019s senior point guard, Konner Harris, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her knee, Jackson said. When Chicago State set out to face Grand Canyon University in Phoenix in late January, its top scorer, a swing player named Kaylee Allen, was out with a concussion. Only one substitute was available.Nadia Miller, a guard, was hit in the eye with five minutes remaining. She kept rubbing it with her jersey but remained in the game until the final buzzer.Once again, the Cougars played hard but ultimately came up short.\u201cYou can imagine the heart it takes,\u201d said Trenn Moore, a 1996 graduate of Chicago State who watched the game in Phoenix with her daughter, both wearing school sweatshirts. Given the university\u2019s financial situation, Moore said, \u201cI\u2019m pleasantly surprised they\u2019re still able to travel.\u201dOn Feb. 4, at home, Chicago State faced New Mexico State, the WAC\u2019s top team and undefeated in conference play.The announced crowd at Jones Convocation Center, a first-rate arena, was 230, but the atmosphere was expectant. Players and coaches on both teams and a number of fans wore pink to promote breast cancer awareness. Allen, the Cougars\u2019 best player, had been cleared to return after the effects of a concussion subsided.Calm, determined, the expression never changing on her face, Allen helped keep Chicago State within two points after three quarters. On the one-year anniversary of the Cougars\u2019 last victory, a huge upset was within reach.Then a familiar deflation occurred.The short-handed Cougars did not score for nearly four and a half minutes to open the fourth quarter. They grew tired against New Mexico State\u2019s press. Rebounding was unreliable. Confidence seemed to ebb. Chicago State lost 65-54 \u2014 another somber walk through the handshake line.A couple of days earlier, Jackson said she had \u201cnever been so proud\u201d of a team. \u201cThose young ladies,\u201d she said, \u201cthey haven\u2019t quit, they haven\u2019t wavered, they have stuck together.\u201dEven in a winless season, there were other encouraging signs. None of the 15 allowable basketball scholarships had been slashed by school officials. Three recruits had pledged to Chicago State for next season.Under the circumstances, Jackson said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can ask for much more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond \u2018Hidden Figures\u2019: Nurturing New Black and Latino Math Whizzes", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs there a 10-digit number where the first digit is equal to how many 0\u2019s are in the number, the second digit is equal to how many 1\u2019s are in the number, the third digit is equal to how many 2\u2019s are in the number, all the way up to the last digit, which is equal to how many 9\u2019s are in the number?Within the scrum was a trio of friends-in-formation: \u201cCan we work on this during Open Math Time?\u201d one asked. The second, wearing red-and-black glasses and dogged by the fear that he did not belong \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m really not that good at math,\u201d he had told me earlier \u2014 lingered at the snack cart. \u201cLeave some for the rest of us, J. J.,\u2019\u2019 demanded the third, gently elbowing him aside.To Mira Bernstein, a BEAM instructor and a leading figure in the extracurricular math ecosystem that incubates many of the nation\u2019s scientists and engineers, the scene was unremarkable, except for one striking feature: None of the children were wealthy, and few were white or Asian.Try your hand at five math problems given to students at BEAM. The questions require no knowledge beyond addition and multiplication \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re easy.The 76 students, drawn from New York City public schools with low-income populations, were embarking on a curriculum that they would have to continue on their own during the school year to be eligible to apply for a second, even more intense math summer program, BEAM 7. That application is due at the end of this month, and with it comes a verdict of sorts on their membership in a math-geek subculture where it can be astonishingly difficult to find others who look like them.\u201cThis is probably more math-y black and Hispanic kids than I\u2019ve seen in my whole career,\u201d said Dr. Bernstein, who received a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from Harvard in the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201dBEAM is short for Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, and this, the program\u2019s first year of BEAM 6, for students who had just completed the sixth grade, is what many within elite math circles see as the most promising effort yet to diversify their ranks. The four weeks, spent in a school near City Hall, would be intense: four hours of math a day taught by 10 experienced math teachers, several of them Ph.D.\u2019s. There would be no prepping for standardized tests or effort to cover school material at a faster pace. Instead, as in the elite summer programs that Mr. Zaharopol had himself attended, BEAM focused on the kind of creative problem-solving that mathematicians say lie at the heart of the discipline.And because one summer would not be anywhere near enough to equip the BEAM 6-ers with the same kind of math preparation as their more affluent peers, the real goal of the founders \u2014 a mix of hedge-fund millionaires and professional mathematicians \u2014 was to hook them enough to want to keep at it.A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who suspended his graduate studies in algebraic topology to launch BEAM, Mr. Zaharopol had some idea of what his students were up against.By age 12, many attendees of the highly selective programs on which BEAM was modeled had already won regional math contests and completed online math courses in subjects like number theory. Some had been introduced to advanced math in school honors programs or by math teams. Many were the children of scientists and engineers, or of well-off parents who turned to math as another way to give their children a competitive edge in the battle for admission to elite colleges.By contrast, BEAM students come from environments where \u201cmath is not in the air,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said.\u201cThey did a study that shows white kids have more chances,\u201d he said once, remembering a fragment of something he had been told. Then he shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really true.\u201dTracing Jonathan\u2019s path through the program and into the school year provides a glimpse of both how easy it might be to nurture a love of math, and how daunting. It is also a testament to the persuasive power of friendship, unfolding over several months in the context of prime numbers and polyhedron sculptures.Jonathan, who chose J. J. as his summer nickname, had done everything in his power to avoid attending BEAM, which is financed by individual donors and foundations, and is free to participants. Then 11, he was chosen by his school to take the program\u2019s admissions test, and hid the acceptance letter upon receiving it last spring at school.When his mother, Kiana Ashburn, 32, found the letter buried at the bottom of his backpack, she waved off his pleas to go to the karate camp she had signed him up for. \u201cYou need to get a good education so you can get a good job and have a good future,\u201d she told him that afternoon in their sparely furnished rowhouse in the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx.She often made Jonathan repeat what he was to do if he were ever stopped: \u201cJust do what he says, and like, don\u2019t try to resist,\u201d he recited.She thought of math as a field that \u201cusually Asians dominate,\u2019\u2019 she said. It would not protect him from police violence, she knew, or the other things she feared. Her brother had spent time in prison.\u201cBut it could act as a buffer,\u201d she remembers thinking.Omar Pineda Jr. was the counselor assigned to escort them, but it was Emyr Willis, 11, who broke the ice. \u201cHello,\u201d he greeted them with the formality they would come to see as his trademark. \u201cI am the both the emissary and ambassador from my school.\u201dThays Garcia, also 11, was the group\u2019s third member.\u201cI love math,\u201d she said, her face lighting up when asked why she had agreed to spend her summer doing math problems.Her stepfather, Kevin Rincon, who dropped her off each morning, said he had taught himself algebra while serving a prison sentence for a drug felony.As she breezed ahead several grade levels, her friends gave her a nickname that she proudly took on: \u201cCalculator.\u201dBut Khan, Mr. Rincon also knew, was designed to foster basic math literacy, not \u201cthe theoretic understanding of exactly what is going on,\u201d as he put it in his email to BEAM. \u201cI want new possibilities and worlds opened for her to see.\u201dJonathan did not know it, but he had placed comfortably in the top half of the students admitted to BEAM, who in turn had been drawn from the top quarter of the 400 nominated by schools or parents to take the admissions test. He had spotted patterns and tried solutions that others had not.He had also placed above grade level on New York\u2019s statewide math test, a distinction shared by only 21 percent of the city\u2019s sixth graders, and just 7 percent of sixth graders who are black.He and Thays and Emyr were exactly the kinds of promising students for which BEAM had been created.But it had not been easy to get it going. Some potential supporters objected to devoting resources to high-performing minority students rather than the much larger group performing below grade level.In interviews, directors of established elite math programs expressed dismay at the way their own enrollments reflect those patterns.Most are nonprofits with limited money, organized by trained mathematicians for the benefit of students whose passion for math often leaves them at the bottom of social hierarchies at school. Some offer scholarships, but most said it was often difficult to find qualified students from underrepresented groups.There are other reasons for career disparities beyond who goes to math camp, of course, like the expense of postsecondary education and an effectively segregated public school system that provides poorer-quality education to many minority students.But the math divide is growing as more white and Asian parents enroll their children, even when they don\u2019t show a knack for numbers, in online math classes and the weekly math circles that have sprouted on university campuses. And the lack of enrichment-math experiences for black and Latino students, mathematicians and educators say, makes it harder for even high achievers in good schools to compete for spots at the colleges that serve as a springboard for plum jobs in science and technology.BEAM was founded in 2011 with help from Sandor Lehoczky, a senior trader at Jane Street and a onetime math team champion, who is known for subjecting job applicants to math puzzles. The math whizzes he hires, he said, have been \u201cswimming in a culture of math\u2019\u2019 from an early age.But BEAM\u2019s selective camp for students from low-income backgrounds who had just completed seventh grade has had mixed results.\u201cAlthough our students make tremendous progress,\u201d Mr. Zaharopol wrote in a 2015 grant proposal, \u201cit is clear that many of them, even our highest achievers, are still well below their potential.\u201dBEAM 6, designed for students who have just completed sixth grade, he said, reflected what they had learned: \u201cWe need to start earlier and we need to keep them for longer,\u2019\u2019 he said.At BEAM, Jonathan turned the lights off when he walked in and out of classrooms. He sped from one end of the room to another on his rolling chair, popping in on fellow students who were supposed to be working. He seemed more focused on complaining about the lunch food than zeroing in on logic.\u201cMathematicians love the struggle,\u201d one of the teachers repeated as a kind of mantra when students complained. \u201cWhen you feel uncomfortable, you\u2019re learning.\u201dBut whether students like Jonathan were having trouble with the math, were unprepared or were simply not trying was a subject of debate.In their weekly faculty meetings, the teachers often marveled at their students\u2019 progress. \u201cI can\u2019t get them to stop doing math,\u201d said Giselle George, who teaches at a public middle school on the Lower East Side.But teaching advanced concepts to students who had not all had the chance to learn certain basic math skills, like the laws of exponents, proved more difficult than some had anticipated.\u201cI find they\u2019re not very good at self-advocating when they\u2019re lost or bored,\u201d said another teacher, Marcelle Good. \u201cI guess they\u2019re used to being lost or bored.\u201dDuring the program\u2019s second week, Jonathan was a focus for both their hopes and their frustrations.\u201cHow do you get kids who haven\u2019t had the exposure the tools to even realize that math is something they like?\u201d Dr. Bernstein lamented.\u201cI\u2019m open to suggestions for how to reach him,\u201d said another. \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty big distraction in my class.\u201dBeyond their views, though, there were signs that Jonathan was finding other ways to connect to math.A few days after the challenge problem was posted in the hallway, he was lingering by the snack cart again when Thays arrived.\u201cHey, Thays,\u201d he said, brightening slightly at the sight of his commuting partner.He had infuriated her that morning by snapping a close-up picture of her nostrils with his phone, but had quickly redeemed himself by directing her to the sole empty seat on the crowded train.He shrugged, looking sideways at her.\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said.By the second week of camp, Jonathan, Emyr and Thays knew the passcodes to one another\u2019s phones so they could trade games. Thays and Jonathan had a running Subway Surfers phone game competition; Emyr sought to inspire the others with his passion for Pokemon Go.But they didn\u2019t share everything. Thays did not divulge, for instance, that her biological father, whom she rarely saw, had canceled plans for a trip she was looking forward to later in the summer.His friends did not know that Jonathan\u2019s father was a subway train conductor whom he had last seen about a year ago, in a chance encounter at the 125th street subway station near his school.Emyr did not talk about the bullies who had tormented him in elementary school.Thays, whose parents and stepfather are Dominican, had been to a protest some months earlier with her stepfather. She had written a poem about it.Jonathan had a vivid memory of the video his mother had shown him earlier that month: \u201cThere was a kid in the back of the car,\u201d he said, referring to the death of Philando Castile.Trying to translate, I asked Emyr if he had heard of Black Lives Matter. Emyr\u2019s father is Jamaican, his mother Puerto Rican.\u201cNo,\u201d Emyr said. \u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201dJonathan, looking up from his phone, took the opportunity to fill him in.\u201cHow can you not know what Black Lives Matter is?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s about how black people are getting killed by cops and it needs to stop.\u201dSeeking to lighten the trip home that afternoon, Mr. Pineda asked what they recalled of their day.Thays volunteered the simple riddle Dr. Bernstein had asked in her \u201cCodes Codes Codes\u201d class: \u201cI\u2019m thinking of a number from zero to 15. You have to guess my number by asking me four yes or no questions.\u201dThen Thays added the problem\u2019s final complication: \u201cHow many questions does it take if I\u2019m allowed to lie once?\u201dAs they deduced the strategy, they were working up to a harder problem, related to Hamming codes, the error-correcting codes that underlie digital storage and communications.\u201cThere\u2019s also something called binary,\u201d Thays informed Jonathan and Emyr.The girls she had become friends with in that class had agreed that they were all going to BEAM 7, she volunteered. \u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to BEAM 7,\u201d Emyr said.\u201cJ. J.?\u201d she prodded. But he was peering into his phone.That Jonathan was one of just a few African-American boys at BEAM (some of the other black students were the children of African or Caribbean immigrants) could have been a fluke. Or it could have been a reflection of the unique forms of discrimination faced by young African-American males, even in elementary school.Whatever the reason, many of the college-age counselors working alongside the teachers at BEAM were paying special attention to Jonathan.One of them was Christian Henderson, an African-American accounting major at Siena College, in Loudonville, N.Y. \u201cIt\u2019s important to educate a kid like J. J. right now,\u201d he said, \u201cso they know in their head they\u2019re on the same level as any white or Asian or Hispanic kid, before they get a little older and they see other people may not think, you know, that\u2019s true.\u201dJonathan\u2019s subway counselor, Mr. Pineda, 22, who is part Honduran and part Dominican, told Jonathan how a professor at Amherst College had mentioned that summer math camp had paved the way for many of his wealthy white classmates, whereas he felt lost during his sophomore year in discrete mathematics.By most measures, he knew, he was a success story. He had just graduated with a degree in math and Japanese studies. But it still bothered him that his classmates, the \u201csummer math nerds,\u201d as he and a friend had taken to calling them, had zoomed ahead.\u201cYou should look at this, J. J.,\u201d Mr. Pineda said on the Thursday afternoon of BEAM\u2019s second week, leafing through his homework folder to a triangular numbers problem. \u201cI think you\u2019d like it.\u201dThe following morning, Thays collapsed in pain at the Columbus Circle subway station as they were waiting for the A train.Emyr paced. Jonathan patted her arm. Mr. Pineda debated what to do. Her stomach hurt, she said. He tried to reach her parents, then called 911.Another counselor met the boys to take them to camp while Mr. Pineda accompanied Thays to the emergency room.When she didn\u2019t come back the next day, or the next, Jonathan railed at Thays\u2019s invisible presence as he, Mr. Pineda and Emyr made the morning commute. \u201cThays! I know you\u2019re just at home watching TV!\u201dHe also found himself thinking about math on the subway, visualizing a problem with triangular numbers and sifting through their patterns.BEAM teachers had explained it as a combination of math and pocket change: A triangular number is the number of pennies required if you\u2019re trying to make a triangle.For instance, if you want your triangle to have 2 pennies to a side, you\u2019ll need 3 pennies total; if you want it to have 3 pennies to a side, you need 6 pennies; for a triangle of 4 pennies to a side, you need 10.So 3, 6, 10 (and so on) are called the triangular numbers, and Jonathan was in search of the 299th triangular number. With the help of Marquia Williams, a BEAM counselor who was majoring in math at the State University of New York at Oswego, he figured it out, rewarding her with a stifled grin.After nearly a week away, Thays returned \u2014 her collapse had been caused by an ulcer that required minor surgery \u2014 to find Jonathan actually sitting still. He even raised his hand once in a while to offer insights in the class they shared.At home on one of the final days, Jonathan\u2019s sister, Jasmine, sat on the steps of their house. She had been attending summer school to catch up in several classes.\u201cHow\u2019s that camp going?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you still behind in your math?\u201dHe was silent for a moment.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not at that camp because I\u2019m bad at math,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019m there because I\u2019m good at math.\u201dOn the last day of program, the BEAM students gathered in a room to receive a graduation certificate. As their names were called, the counselors cheered. An especially loud one erupted for Jonathan.They would also receive problem sets in the mail, he told them, and he hoped they would send them back. The application for BEAM 7 would come at the end of the year.Emyr was among many who sobbed as the assembly broke up.A few parents had taken up the invitation to attend, including Thays\u2019s stepfather, but he was under strict instructions to drive home on his own.\u201cShe wants to go home with her regular group,\u201d he said, shrugging.On the subway, Thays fished in her bag, pulling out a white envelope that she gave to Omar; then another that she gave to Emyr, marked with a drawing of his favorite Pokemon character.\u201cYou made a slight mistake with the Pikachu,\u201d he noted. \u201cTheir eyes are supposed to be black on white.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s my present?\u201d Jonathan demanded, as she chatted with Omar. \u201cCome on, Thays.\u201dThays let a few more stops go by before relenting. Jonathan tore open the envelope.\u201cOh special, special JJ,\u201d she had written. \u201cYou are so annoying and rude. You always would get me mad and never stopped bothering me. But you always made the train ride fun. You were such a good BEAM friend and I hope to see you in BEAM 7.\u201dJonathan paused for a moment before looking up.\u201cNow if you gave me a Nerf gun, it would be better for everyone,\u201d he said, and put his arm around her.The three exchanged phone numbers.A few weeks later, poring over the surveys the students filled out on the last day, Mr. Zaharopol and his staff could take some measure of satisfaction. \u201cI want to get a Ph.D. in math,\u201d one student had written. Neither of his parents had graduated from college. Jonathan, in his review, recommended to future students that they pack their own lunches. He also wrote: \u201cI learned math they don\u2019t teach me at school.\u201dThe teachers, though, wondered how much they\u2019d really been able to achieve.\u201cThey\u2019re extremely passionate, and quick to pick up things,\u201d Mr. Zaharopol said in late October, when the BEAM staff gathered for an assessment. \u201cBut how many will stick with it? And are we reaching them soon enough?\u201dAs police shootings of black men continued and Donald J. Trump moved into the White House, Jonathan\u2019s mother had started to question her belief in the power of math to provide her son with a buffer. \u201cIt\u2019s just shocking that his views are the views of a lot of Americans,\u201d she said of the new president.She had allowed Jonathan to take karate after school, and by the start of winter he had obtained his advanced white belt.Jonathan had not heard from Thays, and he was flagging in the online pre-algebra class for which he had dutifully signed up. Sometimes his internet service, always erratic, would disconnect during the lessons.\u201cI might not be able to do it for a few weeks,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have homework.\u201dBut Emyr noted that all three of their names were on the short list of students who had sent back at least two correct answers to one of the problem sets that BEAM sent home.And one evening, on the top bunk of the bed he shares with his brothers, Jonathan decided to try Thays again.\u201cHey,\u201d he typed into his phone.\u201cWho is this?\u201d came the reply.\u201cJonathan from BEAM,\u201d he replied.\u201cJ. J.??!!\u201dHer phone had been broken, she explained. She hadn\u2019t received his texts.They traded messages, until Jonathan\u2019s mother reminded him that his phone privileges had been suspended.\u201cI am grounded for a week, so this is the last time we will be talking for now,\u201d he typed quickly.When the BEAM 7 applications arrived earlier this month, Thays and Emyr set to work. No math problems this time, just questions, 11 of them. What did she want to achieve in the eighth grade? \u201cI want to get into Bronx Science!\u201d Thays wrote, a reference to one of the city\u2019s most selective public high schools. \u201cI mean who doesn\u2019t?\u201d Why did he want to go to BEAM 7? \u201cTo see my BEAM peers,\u201d wrote Emyr, in addition to \u201cchallenging my brain.\u201dJonathan let his application sit on the kitchen table for a week. He let a long snow day with no school pass without looking at it. If he didn\u2019t want to go, his mother had told him, she wouldn\u2019t force him. He could do karate instead. Last Sunday, he began filling in the blanks. What kind of math did he find interesting? However unwittingly, his answer reflected BEAM\u2019s key lesson: \u201cI find proportion problems interesting because I\u2019ll always be confused,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I figure out the answer anyways.\u201dOn Monday, at work, his mother put it in the mail.An earlier version of this article misidentified the academic affiliation of Prof. Danny Martin. He is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, not at the University of Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Humble Basement Boiler Gets a Penthouse, Above Flood Level", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResilient DesignBoiler room and basement.They go together like mac and cheese. Twitter and Trump.The association, which runs 37 buildings in the area, did not want a repeat. So it installed a new gas-fired boiler, this time putting it in an enclosure on the roof. The boiler began supplying heat and hot water last month.Across the country, cellar-dwelling utilities are being moved farther and farther upstairs. In new buildings going up in identified flood plains, mechanical systems are being constructed at least several feet above expected flood levels. Even in existing buildings, plenty of retrofitting is underway.Basement boiler rooms made sense when coal was the principal fuel. Gravity could do a lot of the work of moving it from sidewalk to storage bin. Oil and gas have fueled heat and hot water boilers for many decades, however.\u201cAll the reasons for boilers in basements are gone,\u201d said Henry Gifford, the mechanical system designer in the architectural office of Chris Benedict, who salvaged the old boiler at 334 East Eighth Street and supervised the installation of the new boiler.Built at the turn of the 20th century, No. 334 is two buildings in one: virtually identical \u201cdumbbell\u201d tenements \u2014 so called because they fill the width of the lot at either end but are narrower in the middle to create a light court.Twenty years later, under Mayor David N. Dinkins, the city conveyed the building to what was then known as the Mutual Housing Partnership, to be renovated as housing for low- and moderate-income families. Enterprise Community Partners raised $665,228 from private investors to finance the project. (The investors benefited from a tax credit over 15 years.)No one at 334 East Eighth Street had any notion how devastating Sandy would turn out to be.Isabel Ortiz, 53, has lived on the fifth floor of the building since it was rehabilitated, having won her studio apartment in a lottery. Ms. Ortiz works at Job Corps, helping young students obtain high school equivalency certificates and vocational training. She went to bed on the night of Sandy scared but hopeful.\u201cI figured I\u2019d be O.K.,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI had no idea what devastation I\u2019d wake up to.\u201dPower was out. Heat was off. Elevators were not working. Her neighbors were in a state of shock.Roberto Figueroa, the superintendent, said floodwaters reached about five and a half feet in the basement. And it was not just water, but a foul, oleaginous cocktail of water and hundreds of gallons of hydraulic fluid from the elevator machinery.Shivering with cold \u2014 doors to the outside were kept open to prevent the growth of mold \u2014 Mr. Gifford supervised the repair of the old boiler, working under bare light bulbs and temporary electrical power lines strung along the basement ceiling.There was enough money in the operating budget to pull this off once, Mr. Ramirez said. Never again.As the association and its architects discussed what to do, the answer was obvious. \u201cWe said, \u2018The boiler should go to the roof,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Benedict, the architect.This was preferable to the approach of creating a watertight concrete enclosure around the basement boiler, given the height of the underground water table. \u201cIn effect, you\u2019d be building a boat,\u201d Mr. Gifford explained, \u201cand the buoyancy force would lift the boiler room and knock the building down.\u201dThe rooftop was scarcely designed to accommodate a 50,000-pound boiler penthouse, so two steel I-beams were laid down, resting on the existing brick exterior walls. Steel joists were placed perpendicularly between the beams. The enclosure was built on that framework.Since the rooftop boiler was turned on, Ms. Ortiz said, the heat and hot water have been in steady supply.There was another big problem. Each apartment had its own Con Ed meter in the basement, and there was no room upstairs for such a large array. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even lose one bedroom to metering,\u201d Mr. Gifford said.It is no easy matter to retrofit a tenement from the turn of the 20th century, but the housing association sees no alternative.\u201cPeople live and die in these apartments,\u201d Mr. Ramirez said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated where a photograph showing Hurricane Sandy flooding was taken. It was taken on Avenue C, not from a doorway on East Eighth Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Being Donald Trump Jr., the Businessman, Won\u2019t Be Easy", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump Jr. struck a pose in this 2010 photograph befitting a serious young businessman on the rise.When it was taken at the Trump SoHo hotel in New York, Mr. Trump was 32 years old and playing a growing role inside the Trump Organization. He was also looking to step outside the shadow of his father, Donald J. Trump, and make his own mark. Today, his father is the president, and the younger Mr. Trump has become one of the highest-profile business figures in the United States. He and his younger brother Eric now run the Trump Organization on a day-to-day basis.Of the people in this photograph, Mr. Blackburn has worked most closely with Donald Trump Jr. The two men initially met in the early 2000s and, in 2010, they formed a business together called\u00a0Titan Atlas\u00a0Manufacturing whose aftermath still dogs the president\u2019s son.Mr. Blackburn\u2019s track record aside, Mr. Trump agreed to help him start Titan Atlas. The company, in North Charleston, S.C., made panels for prefabricated houses. It quickly failed and Mr. Trump\u2019s father had to bail him out by taking over a $3.65 million bank loan. Mr. Trump was also Mr. Blackburn\u2019s partner in another venture, an effort to redevelop a former naval hospital in North Charleston into an office complex.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Mexican Shakedown", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 In Mexico\u2019s so-called drug war, cartel gunmen have often used their violent power to demand money from innocent people. It\u2019s a heinous crime that scars communities and blights growth, and it has provoked terrorized villages to rise up to chase out the extortionists. Now Mexico finds itself facing the biggest shakedown of all from north of the Rio Grande, as the United States president demands $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for a border wall.This is not meant to be a jokey comparison. President Trump\u2019s insistence that he will force Mexico to pay is the definition of extortion: obtaining un-owed money through coercion. It is a dark moment in American foreign policy that has implications far beyond the southern border; it tells the world the United States no longer believes in fair play or the rule of law. Any officials involved in such a shakedown should search their conscience.The wall itself will be largely ineffective \u2014 most likely a fence that smugglers will climb over, tunnel under and drill through. If the United States wants to pour billions into such a structure, it can. But it is patently outrageous to force a neighboring country to pay for your own infrastructure.President Trump claims Mexico should pay because it has an annual trade surplus of $60 billion with the United States.This is utter madness. By the same logic, the United States should be paying billions to all the countries it has a trade surplus with, including Australia, the Netherlands, Singapore and Qatar.President Trump has not made it clear how he will collect the money. The idea he floated of a 20 percent tax on goods coming from Mexico fell like a ton of bricks when it was pointed out that American consumers would be the ones paying. In the campaign, Mr. Trump released a memo saying the United States could force Mexico to pay by blocking remittances, the nearly $25 billion sent home by Mexicans every year, money earned from hard labor that supports the poorest communities south of the border. It has also been suggested he will try to tax those transfers. Either action would be challenged in the courts, especially as most of that money has already been taxed, and migrants would look for alternative ways to move it. But he might succeed in getting some of his funds this way.If Mr. Trump runs up the national debt, he will be under increasing pressure to get back his wall dollars. And the way the wall is financed now could determine how the shakedown plays out. If Congress passes a bill to fund the wall, lawmakers need to force out any wording that commits to collecting the money from Mexico.The demand that Mexico pay for the wall was the breaking point in other negotiations on trade and immigration. It was the issue that forced President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto into a corner, so he had no choice but to cancel his meeting in Washington. Money aside, it became a question of national humiliation.But perhaps this idea of humiliating Mexico is what really appeals to President Trump and his most fervent supporters. As Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vald\u00e9s, a political scientist at Mexico\u2019s Autonomous Metropolitan University, said to me: \u201cHe wants to make an example of Mexico to show how he will deal with countries around the world.\u201dShakedowns are cemented through violence. Behind Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, many Mexicans sense the implicit threat of American force, backed by a history of occupations and wars. \u201cThere is a real risk of the conflict turning into violence,\u201d Ms. Vald\u00e9s said. \u201cThis man is capable of anything.\u201dI hope such fears are crazy. They should be.Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Hurries to Slash Oil and Gas Rules, Ending Industries\u2019 8-Year Wait", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The document carried the title \u201cA Roadmap to Repeal,\u201d a concise list of Obama administration environmental regulations that a Koch brothers-backed group was pressing President Trump and Congress to quickly reverse after Inauguration Day.It was a tally of rules that energy industry executives and lobbyists had waged a futile fight against for eight years, donating millions of dollars to lawmakers who vowed to help block them, filing lawsuits to try to overturn them and hiring experts to generate reports that questioned the need for them.But in a flurry of activity this past week, Congress did what Charles G. and David H. Koch \u2014 who own a conglomerate that sells hundreds of products, including gasoline, jet fuel and coal \u2014 and other industry leaders had been asking for.Using a rarely invoked law, the Republican-controlled Congress nullified a measure intended to curb the venting of gas wells on federal lands, and began the process of rolling back other regulations, including one enacted to limit damage that coal mines cause to streams \u2014 each items on the \u201cRoadmap to Repeal.\u201dOn Friday, with his own executive orders, Mr. Trump took up two more items on the list, including a call to rewrite major provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, legislation crafted by the Obama administration and passed by Congress in response to the 2008 financial meltdown.Not since the Reagan administration has Washington moved so quickly to roll back or nullify so many federal regulations, one of the clearest signs of an abrupt shift of power in a government now under one-party control that has flipped the script of winners and losers.\u201cIt is a big, fat victory, after all this time,\u201d said Luke Popovich, a vice president at the National Mining Association, an industry trade group.Here is a document that Freedom Partners \u2014 a group organized and funded by the Koch brothers \u2014 released in early January, detailing what it hoped President Trump and Congress would do first, in terms of rolling back regulations, many of which impact the energy industry. Congress and Mr. Trump started to move through the list this past week.A three-way alliance has now been formed among Congress, the Trump administration and industries that struggled to reverse what they saw as an out-of-control rush to regulate by the Obama administration.This new alignment of power is causing alarm among not only environmental groups but also other \u2014 mostly liberal \u2014 advocates who have spent much of the past eight years pushing for new rules to cover Wall Street banks, broadband providers, teacher preparation requirements, prepaid credit cards and even companies that sell high-calorie foods in vending machines.All of these measures, and many others, now stand a chance of being reversed, watered down or blocked.\u201cFor the last several years, whenever Congress would concoct some way to roll back a rule protecting clean air or clean water or undermine the fight against climate change, we always felt confident as we had an adult in charge at the White House,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental group. \u201cNow, what used to be a wish list of the oil and coal and gas industry has become the to-do list for Congress and the White House.\u201dFor Republicans, these first moves are the easy part, made possible by a law that gives Congress the power to reverse regulations within 60 legislative days with a simple majority vote in the House and Senate. Other Republican efforts to exploit this 20-year-old law \u2014 which until this week had been used only once to nullify a new rule \u2014 were thwarted five times with vetoes by President Obama since 2015.Once the 60-day window expires, Republicans will have a harder time reversing Mr. Obama\u2019s regulations, but will still have tools at their disposal, including cutting financing for the enforcement of rules, issuing new rules that are weaker, or negotiating with Democrats to pass new legislation.They have bold ambitions, including rescinding a rule enacted by the Obama administration that could close dozens of coal burning power plants, and another that would extend overtime pay eligibility to an estimated four million Americans.At a private meeting on Thursday hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, a senior White House adviser provided a plan on how the administration would handle efforts to curtail environmental regulations beyond the initial rush now underway to nullify recently adopted rules, said an energy industry executive who participated in the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity because details were confidential.Industry advocates and their allies in Congress said the long-awaited moves toward deregulation was good for consumers and the economy, as they simply wanted to eliminate measures that they believed cost jobs and drove up prices. Among the regulations being targeted: the methane rule, an Interior Department measure meant to reduce so-called flaring, when gas leaking from wells is burned off like a giant blow torch.\u201cEven on the way out the door, the former administration\u2019s regulatory onslaught continued as they pushed through more midnight regulations,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said on Wednesday, as he urged his colleagues to reverse the coal mining regulation, known as the Stream Buffer Rule. \u201cFortunately, with a new president, we now have the opportunity to give the American people relief and our economy a boost.\u201dLobbyists for the so-called extraction industry \u2014 oil, gas, coal and other mining operations \u2014 said they were as surprised as anyone else by the outcome of the November election, which gave them new clout in Washington.\u201cA lot of us folks just did not anticipate we were going to be doing this,\u201d said Stephen Brown, a lobbyist at Tesoro, an oil refining and marketing company based in San Antonio. \u201cIt was like the dog that caught up with the UPS truck.\u201dWithin days of the election, conference calls and meetings between industry lobbyists, members of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition teams and key Republican staff members on Capitol Hill were taking place. Those who took part began to plot out which regulations they wanted to go after first, participants in the process said.Energy rules quickly ended up at the top of the list. Mr. Obama was unusually aggressive in using his regulatory powers to expand the reach of the federal government over the energy industry, after failing to win the support he needed in Congress to pass legislation to take similar steps.But the energy industry spends about $300 million a year lobbying Congress, deploying an army of three lobbyists for each member. It also contributed more than $160 million during the most recent election cycle to federal candidates, with 80 percent of that going to Republicans, according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group. And the industry now wanted congressional leaders like Mr. McConnell, who is from one of the country\u2019s top coal-producing states, to nullify the Obama administration\u2019s new rules.\u201cThis has been a full-court press to block these rules, from a legal standpoint, a policy standpoint and a political standpoint,\u201d said Bret Sumner, an oil and gas industry lawyer, who serves on the board of the Western Energy Alliance, a trade group that has aggressively lobbied Congress to block Obama administration regulations governing drilling on federal lands.Mr. Sumner\u2019s group, along with the American Petroleum Institute and other major industry trade associations and individual companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, all pressed congressional leaders to immediately repeal the methane rule, which the Interior Department finalized in November.The measure, according to the department, would force companies to prevent the release of gas via flaring or leaks, eliminating an estimated 180,000 tons a year of methane gas, a contributing factor in climate change, while also increasing federal revenue by as much as $10 million a year, as the energy companies pay royalties only on fuel they contain and then sell.For its part, the coal industry pushed Congress to reverse the Stream Buffer Rule, also drafted by the Interior Department, that prevented mining companies from cutting off mountaintops in search of coal and other commodities, then dumping the remaining debris into nearby valleys. The department predicted the rule would protect 6,000 miles of streams and an estimated 52,000 acres of forests over the coming two decades.\u201cIt did not take a big pitch,\u201d said Hal Quinn, president of the National Mining Association, of his group\u2019s lobbying effort targeting congressional leaders to get its measure on the repeal list. \u201cWe clearly reinforced the fact this is ripe and due for Congress to reassert its power.\u201dA third rule targeted for quick repeal was one adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that required oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments for development rights \u2014 a provision intended to prevent corruption in places like Africa and Latin America. Billions of dollars from such payments have disappeared over the past several decades, at times siphoned by government officials for their personal use, instead of being used to improve the standard of living in these often impoverished nations.Exxon Mobil, whose former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, just became secretary of state, was one of the provision\u2019s primary opponents. He argued that the rule would force the company to disclose \u201ccommercially sensitive information\u201d and make it harder to compete against certain foreign oil companies that do not need to comply.By Friday, both the House and Senate had approved the first two of these repeals \u2014 on the stream rule and the foreign government payments \u2014 and final action by the Senate approving the repeal of the methane gas rule is expected soon.Mr. Trump has already put out a memo welcoming the rule reversals by Congress. \u201cThe administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on America\u2019s businesses,\u201d said a statement issued by the White House on Wednesday.The push to repeal these rules has created moments of obvious frustration for Democrats on the floor of the House and Senate chambers. As the blitz began this past week, Democratic lawmakers used various props \u2014 like poster-size photographs of fish harmed by mining industry practices \u2014 to try to make their points.Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, arrived on the chamber floor with a mock \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d board, with slivers marked \u201ccoal,\u201d \u201cmining\u201d and \u201ceven more oil\u201d indicating the available prizes that Congress was offering.\u201cLet\u2019s consult our wheel to see who is the big winner of the G.O.P. giveaway this week,\u201d Mr. Markey said, essentially conceding that Senate Democrats were all but certain to lose many of these fights.But for Freedom Partners \u2014 the secretive club of hugely wealthy political donors led and organized by the Koch brothers \u2014 it was a week to celebrate, as there had been a great deal of progress on their \u201cRoadmap to Repeal\u201d list.James Davis, an executive vice president at the group, sent a message late on Friday declaring \u201cthese repeal bills will soon be on their way to President Trump for his signature.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defying Gravity, Then Listening to Mom", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "Marc M\u00e1rquez, a winner of three MotoGP titles, heads to his parents\u2019 quiet home in Spain during the off-season.Supported byCERVERA, Spain \u2014 Marc M\u00e1rquez was struggling to keep out of trouble, but this was not the usual kind.Rather than defying the laws of gravity on his motorcycle, as he does regularly as perhaps the world\u2019s top racer, M\u00e1rquez was navigating a different challenge: trying to respect his mother\u2019s house rules after a swimming workout with his younger brother, Alex.\u201cYou can\u2019t leave a wet towel inside a bag,\u201d Roser Alent\u00e0 explained after her sons, following her now-crystal clear instructions, placed theirs on a radiator to dry.\u201cThey might be world champions,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they are still my boys, and this is how things need to get done at home.\u201dRacers who become world champions \u2014 a title each of the M\u00e1rquez siblings has earned \u2014 often move to luxurious havens like Monaco and Switzerland. But the M\u00e1rquez brothers have stuck to parental supervision and the terraced house their parents acquired here shortly before Marc was born 23 years ago.That means that each winter \u2014 after M\u00e1rquez is through traveling the world and racing before adoring fans, earning an estimated $11 million a year the last two seasons \u2014 he still sleeps in his old bunk bed, surrounded by a childhood collection of toy cars. During a visit there in January, a pile of unused clothing occupied one corner of the bedroom; surplus gear from a sponsor\u2019s shipment, it would soon be scooped up by cousins.\u201cI understand others might want to spend the winter in a place like the Maldives, but this is where I have always been and still really want to be,\u201d M\u00e1rquez said. \u201cOf course my life is not exactly what it used to be, but if you look at my entourage \u2014 my family, friends and manager \u2014 the change has been zero. And here I can also train with my best friend, my brother.\u201dThe M\u00e1rquez family home has an office filled with the childhood trophies of the siblings. (Motorcycles and the brothers\u2019 more important silverware are kept in a museum in their small town.) In his own bedroom, M\u00e1rquez chooses to keep gifts from fellow champions \u2014 a soccer shoe from Gerard Piqu\u00e9, the Barcelona defender, and a helmet from Fernando Alonso, the Formula One driver \u2014 rather than reminders of just how much, and how fast, he has reset the boundaries of his sport.In 2013, in his first season in the elite MotoGP category, M\u00e1rquez became, at age 20, the youngest rider to win a race as well as the youngest to secure the season title, beating records set 30 years earlier by the American rider Freddie Spencer.\u201cMarc\u2019s ability to recognize what you need to do before you do it, to really anticipate, is unique,\u201d Spencer said in a phone interview. \u201cIf somebody is going to beat your record, you want it to be somebody who can raise the level of the whole sport \u2014 and you can clearly see that everyone has had to be working a lot harder to compete against him.\u201dThe sport is particularly popular in Europe, where the main circuits draw more than 200,000 spectators over a weekend of practice, qualifying laps and racing. In 2015, M\u00e1rquez set a record for the fastest speed during a race, when he broke 350 kilometers per hour, or about 217 miles per hour.M\u00e1rquez\u2019s handling of his motorcycle has been just as revolutionary as his success, a style that finds him leaning so far down in every corner that at times his elbow becomes, along with the knee, another steadying point of contact with the tarmac.Competing against physically stronger racers in his early years, M\u00e1rquez worked to develop a style that allowed him to control an often-oversize motorcycle, said his father, Juli\u00e0. \u201cMarc only developed a man\u2019s body at 18 or 19,\u201d he said of his son, who is about 5 feet 7 inches and 140 pounds.During his debut season on the world tour as a 15-year-old rookie, M\u00e1rquez was so small that his motorcycle had to be weighed down significantly to meet weight regulations. Appropriately, he selected an ant as his racing emblem, since the insect can lift several times its own weight.But M\u00e1rquez had an early advantage as a professional, bringing to the track the lightning-fast reaction times he had honed while skidding in the mud as a junior motocross champion in Catalonia.\u201cMotocross is about improvisation \u2014 you have to react to unexpected holes and ruts \u2014 which most of the guys who\u2019ve always been riding on a flat surface don\u2019t really learn,\u201d said Emilio Alzamora, a former Spanish champion who spotted the talents of a 12-year-old M\u00e1rquez and has been his manager since.In March, M\u00e1rquez will begin his quest for a fourth MotoGP title, at the helm of a Spanish armada that has come to dominate motorcycle racing. Spain hosts four of the 18 races in a global competition whose commercial rights are owned by Dorna, a Spanish company.In fact, Dorna bent the rules to allow M\u00e1rquez to join the Repsol Honda team for the 2013 season by removing a ban on rookies riding for a leading MotoGP team. (Repsol is a Spanish oil company.) But his connections to Spanish racing started years before that.After spending his infancy attending races with his father and uncle, who worked as volunteers organizing weekend motocross competitions, M\u00e1rquez requested his first motorcycle when he was 4. His parents gave him a secondhand model painted white and fuchsia that was initially fitted with stabilizers to keep it from falling over when he rode it.\u201cMarc was already like a sponge, absorbing anything that a rider did, like nobody else of his age,\u201d said his uncle, Ramon M\u00e1rquez. Although he loved riding on rough terrain, M\u00e1rquez reluctantly switched to track racing after the Catalan federation created a new competition and offered to buy the equipment for its first riders.That was enough incentive for a family struggling to finance the racing careers of two sons on the modest salaries of a father who operated a construction digger and a mother who worked as a secretary. When Marc started to grow, his parents added an extra strip of leather to lengthen his first racing suit rather than buy a new one. Alex, three years younger and now about three inches taller than his brother, inherited the suit.\u201cWe would sometimes not dine out to help buy boots for our sons,\u201d M\u00e1rquez\u2019s mother said. \u201cPeople see where Marc and Alex stand now, but we know there were a lot of sacrifices to get there.\u201dIn fact, both parents lost their jobs as a result of Spain\u2019s recent economic crisis, and ever since Juli\u00e0 M\u00e1rquez has followed his sons around the world. It requires him to constantly balance his appreciation of the risk-and-reward decisions inherent in racing, developed over a lifetime watching his sons, with his concerns as their father.\u201cI watch Marc being very aggressive and I sometimes then ask him whether that was really needed,\u201d he said. \u201cMarc\u2019s answer is always that if I don\u2019t try this, I won\u2019t know where the limit is.\u201d\u201cAfter I came to MotoGP, there was criticism that I was too aggressive and taking too many risks, but we now see that others have followed me,\u201d M\u00e1rquez said.Motorcycling is a dangerous contact sport, he argued, which means the tensions are not the same as those between tennis players. \u201cIf it was just about speed, without body contact, I\u2019m sure we would all be friends,\u201d he said.How far can he go? In 2014, Livio Suppo, M\u00e1rquez\u2019s team director, predicted that M\u00e1rquez would eventually overtake Rossi\u2019s nine titles. In an interview, M\u00e1rquez did nothing to push back on the suggestion.And just as he has no plans to leave Cervera, M\u00e1rquez cannot imagine following the example of Casey Stoner, the former Australian champion whose unexpected early retirement in 2012, at 27, allowed M\u00e1rquez to take his place on the Honda team.\u201cIf you take away my bike,\u201d M\u00e1rquez said, \u201cyou remove half of my life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harry and Sidney: Soul Brothers", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlease allow me to divert my gaze for one day away from our national political darkness and toward two national rays of light.Monday is Sidney Poitier\u2019s 90th birthday. His best friend of 70 years, Harry Belafonte, turns 90 on March 1.This is an ode to and appreciation of the friendship \u2014 one of the most remarkable and resilient of our time \u2014 between two Hollywood royals.Poitier and Belafonte didn\u2019t meet until they were 20 years old, and yet Belafonte still considered Poitier his first real friend in life. As Belafonte put it, he lived a \u201cnomadic\u201d life as a child, shuttling back and forth between New York and islands of the Caribbean with his mother as she searched for work. \u201cI did not get rooted long enough to develop what many people have the joy of experiencing, and that is childhood friends.\u201dThe two men met at the American Negro Theatre, where Poitier worked as a janitor while studying with the company and where Belafonte worked as a stagehand. This was where they became performers.The two men quickly broke through to each other, in part because they had so much in common. Not only were they the same age, they were both born to parents of West Indian heritage, enabling them to see the absurdity of racism in America from within and without and to bring a quasi-Pan-African sensibility to the African-American experience.They shared the charmingly ordinary experiences that young friends share, like sneaking into the theater on the same ticket, each seeing half of a show, then filling each other in afterward on the half the other had missed. They called it \u201csharing the burden and the joy.\u201dAnd yet, by leaning on each other, supporting each other (Belafonte counseled Poitier through the dissolution of his marriage, which ended during his nine-year affair with actress Diahann Carroll), pushing each other, and yes, competing with each other (the first time Poitier was cast in a role, he was Belafonte\u2019s understudy), they would both find tremendous popular success. Each man often took roles that the other had turned down or didn\u2019t get.Even at the height of their success both men made an indelible mark on the Civil Rights Movement and changed the very idea of black masculinity.In 1964, Belafonte convinced a hesitant Poitier to help him deliver $70,000 stuffed into a doctor\u2019s bag to Freedom Summer volunteers in the South. They were met by Klansmen who chased them and fired guns at them. As one website put it, referring to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, \u201cThe trip \u2018solidified Poitier\u2019s commitment to SNCC,\u2019 and he would become the symbol of the group\u2019s goals for African-Americans.\u201dFor Belafonte\u2019s part, he formed a committee to support the movement and raised thousands of dollars to help bail the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. out of jail, pay for the release of arrested protesters, help finance freedom rides and bankroll SNCC.Belafonte and Poitier helped organize the March on Washington and helped plan King\u2019s memorial after he was assassinated.I\u2019ve met both men and was enthralled by each. The first time I heard Belafonte speak in person, he spoke so eloquently and passionately that I was sure that he was reading a speech. He wasn\u2019t. The next time I saw him I rehearsed a fan speech in my mind as I approached him, but before I could utter a word, he said to me, \u201cI\u2019m such a fan.\u201d Mind. Blown.When I was on my book tour, Poitier invited me to dinner in Beverly Hills. He was the most charming and graceful person I\u2019ve ever met, famous or not. He told me: \u201cI\u2019m adopting you. I don\u2019t have any sons. I have six daughters.\u201d He insisted that I sign the book for him and his wife: \u201cTo Mom and Dad.\u201dBelafonte and Poitier demonstrated over a lifetime how celebrities could embody activism as well as the quiet power of dignity and grace.King once said of Poitier: \u201cHe is a man of great depth, a man of great social concern, a man who is dedicated to human rights and freedom. Here is a man who, in the words we so often hear now, is a soul brother.\u201dIn fact, I think that is what Poitier and Belafonte found in each other: a soul brother. Happy birthday, gentlemen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Leaks Multiply, Fears of a \u2018Deep State\u2019 in America", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 A wave of leaks from government officials has hobbled the Trump administration, leading some to draw comparisons to countries like Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan, where shadowy networks within government bureaucracies, often referred to as \u201cdeep states,\u201d undermine and coerce elected governments.So is the United States seeing the rise of its own deep state?Not quite, experts say, but the echoes are real \u2014 and disturbing.Though leaks can be a normal and healthy check on a president\u2019s power, what\u2019s happening now extends much further. The United States, those experts warn, risks developing an entrenched culture of conflict between the president and his own bureaucracy.The growing discord between a president and his bureaucratic rank-and-file, he warned, \u201cis dangerous, it encourages deep divisions within society, it creates these constant tensions.\u201d\u201cAs an American citizen I find it really quite disheartening to see all these similarities to Egypt,\u201d Mr. El Amrani said.Though the deep state is sometimes discussed as a shadowy conspiracy, it helps to think of it instead as a political conflict between a nation\u2019s leader and its governing institutions.That can be deeply destabilizing, leading both sides to wield state powers like the security services or courts against one another, corrupting those institutions in the process.Though American democracy is resilient enough to resist such clashes, early hints of a conflict can be tricky to spot because some push and pull between a president and his or her agencies is normal.Leaks can also be an emergency brake on policies that officials believe could be ill-advised or unlawful, such as George W. Bush-era programs on warrantless wiretapping and the Abu Ghraib detention facility in Iraq.\u201cYou want these people to be fighting like cats and dogs over what the best policy is, airing their views, making their case and then, when it\u2019s over, accepting the decision and implementing it,\u201d said Elizabeth N. Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work.\u201d\u201cLeaking is not new,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this level of leaking is pretty unprecedented.\u201dInstitutional conflicts under Mr. Trump, she worried, had grown into something larger and more concerning.Mr. Trump, apparently seeking to cut the intelligence community, State Department, and other agencies out of the policy-making process almost entirely, may have triggered a conflict whose escalation we are seeing in the rising number of leaks.Officials, deprived of the usual levers for shaping policies that are supposed to be their purview, are left with little other than leaking. And the frenetic pace of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders, which the agencies would normally review internally over weeks or months, has them pulling that lever repeatedly.They have leaked draft executive orders, inciting backlashes that led the orders to be shelved. And they have revealed administration efforts to circumvent usual policymaking channels, undermining Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to enact his agenda.Mr. Trump\u2019s moves to consolidate power away from those agencies under his own authority also has them struggling to keep what they see as their crucial role in governance.\u201cWe\u2019re in a world now where the president is playing to the edge of his powers, and I think there are real concerns about the constitutional implications of some of the actions he\u2019s taken,\u201d said Amy Zegart, the co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.That has forced officials in agencies to ask how far they will go themselves. As each side begins to perceive itself as under attack and the other as making dangerous power-grabs, it will justify more and more extreme behavior.\u201cIn President Trump, you have a president whose behavior shocks even more than the content of his policies,\u201d Mr. El Amrani said.\u201cThis was very much the case with Morsi,\u201d he said, which led the civil service to \u201cleak aggressively\u201d to oppose Morsi\u2019s disregard for bureaucratic norms and procedures. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the same thing now.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s tendency to treat each leak as an attack rather than an attempt to influence policy has created an atmosphere in Washington of open institutional conflict.This came after months of worsening relations between Mr. Trump and the intelligence agencies, which he frequently criticized during his campaign.Mr. Trump, in rejecting intelligence assessments that Russia intervened in the election to help him win, has risked implying that he will only accept intelligence bent to his political interests.\u201cIt looks, sounds and feels like a political witch hunt,\u201d said Ms. Zegart. \u201cIt\u2019s like pouring gasoline on the fire.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here is that the president doesn\u2019t even want to hear intelligence that he doesn\u2019t agree with, and jumps to the conclusion that it must be politicized, and must be the result of people conspiring against him,\u201d Ms. Zegart said.By creating the perception of conflict, Mr. Trump may have made it more likely.Mr. Flynn, in his short tenure, exemplified the breakdown between the president\u2019s inner circle and career civil servants. He kept the National Security Council largely shut out of policy-making and sought sweeping changes in foreign policy.For concerned government officials, leaks may have become one of the few remaining means by which to influence not just Mr. Flynn\u2019s policy initiatives but the threat he seemed to pose to their place in democracy. That has fueled speculation that details of Mr. Flynn\u2019s contact with the Russian ambassador could have been leaked as much to undermine Mr. Flynn as out of concern for impropriety.Even if that was not the case, such practices are a hazard of officials\u2019 growing reliance on leaks and other tools of bureaucratic resistance. This risks entrenching a culture of bureaucratic warfare that is adversarial and dysfunctional by default \u2014 not quite a Turkish-style deep state, but not a healthy democracy either.Officials are stuck in a difficult position: Even if each individual leak is justifiable, as insubordination becomes more sustained and overt, it inches deeper into the gray zone of counter-democratic activities.The distinction between deep-state meddling and acceptable protest is difficult to draw in the United States, Ms. Zegart said, because this degree of opposition is so unusual.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can say in advance what inappropriate deep-state activity would look like, because we haven\u2019t seen this before,\u201d she said.In countries like Egypt, Mr. El Amrani said, the line is much clearer.There, \u201cthe deep state is not official institutions rebelling,\u201d he said, but rather \u201cshadowy networks within those institutions, and within business, who are conspiring together and forming parallel state institutions.\u201dMr. Trump, by treating these institutions as if they are already his political enemies, makes that harder to avoid.As that gulf widens, it becomes more likely that mutual mistrust will lead the president and government bureaucracy to actively undermine one another.A lesson of deep states: Even minor decisions become the subject of political infighting, making basic governance difficult. \u201cWe saw in Egypt in 2013 that the result is complete decision-making paralysis,\u201d Mr. El Amrani said.That is one of the milder outcomes. But when institutions with vast power to eavesdrop, fine, harass and detain see themselves as locked in a zero-sum struggle for survival, it is often basic civil liberties and democratic rights that end up in the crossfire.Mr. El Amrani does not believe those worst-case scenarios are likely to come to pass in the United States. But there is still a risk that bureaucratic resistance against the president could become an enduring feature of American politics. Once trust is broken, it is difficult to rebuild.Ms. Zegart agreed. \u201cThere are no good long-term consequences here,\u201d she said. \u201cThis war between the intelligence community and the White House is bad for the intelligence community, bad for the White House, and bad for the nation\u2019s security.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Undoing Obamacare Will Be So Hard", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHouse Republicans will be unveiling their replacement for the Affordable Care Act (a/k/a Obamacare) next week and the White House has been signaling that it may reveal its thoughts not long after.But what is becoming increasingly clear is the extent to which Obamacare has become embedded in the American health care structure and how difficult it will be to craft an acceptable replacement.Any attack on the A.C.A. must start with the recognition that at least 23 million Americans (the Obama White House estimate) and perhaps more than 26 million (some private experts) have been added to the health care rolls. As shown below, this has driven the percentage of Americans without insurance down to 9 percent, by a considerable margin the lowest in history.Perhaps not surprisingly, after years of unpopularity, Obamacare now commands support from a majority of Americans, according to recent polls. And more anecdotally, many of the comments that elected officials have been receiving at town hall meetings this week have focused on preserving the A.C.A., not dismantling it.Even former Speaker John Boehner said Thursday that a full repeal and replace of Obamacare is \u201cnot what\u2019s going to happen\u201d and that Republicans will instead just make some fixes to the health care law \u201cand put a more conservative box around it.\u201dIt\u2019s important to understand how the new health care law has accomplished such a dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured. First, it provides money to participating states to expand their Medicaid programs; about half of the newly insured were brought onto the rolls in this manner.Second, it offers subsidies to Americans further down the economic ladder (but above Medicaid levels) to buy insurance on the new exchanges that were set up by the Federal government and many states. This group accounts for about 36 percent of the newly enrolled.Smaller numbers received their insurance by being able to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26 \u2013 a popular feature of the A.C.A. \u2013 and by buying unsubsidized insurance on the exchanges.The crux of the problem is that the Republicans want to repeal most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the taxes that were put in place to finance the health care expansion, which would make maintaining the benefits mathematically impossible.According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Medicaid expansion and the exchange subsidies will cost $2 trillion over the next 10 years. Some of that would be paid for by a variety of savings in the expenses of Medicare and Medicaid.However, about $1 trillion \u2013 roughly half \u2013 of these costs are being paid for by a variety of taxes and fees that the Republicans want to repeal, provisions like the 3.8 percent levy on investment income, the 0.9 percent surtax on Medicare hospital insurance, penalties on individuals who do not buy coverage and so forth.The Republicans seem to suggest that there are ways to restructure the program to allow for the elimination of most, if not all, of these taxes and fees and still not see material numbers of Americans become uninsured. I know of no serious expert who believes that is possible.So as the new Republican health care proposals are unveiled, look beyond the flowery rhetoric to see what the real impact of these ideas would be.For example, instead of Medicaid\u2019s costs being tied solely to what benefits less well off Americans are entitled to, House Speaker Paul Ryan would like a fixed amount given to each state (known as a \u201cblock grant\u201d). Particularly as time moves on, these amounts would almost surely be less than what is needed to maintain the current benefits.Another favorite Republican idea is to replace the subsidies provided by Obamacare with tax credits. But the current subsidy program is tied to an individual\u2019s income; those with less income get higher subsidies.The Republican proposal would have the tax credits be a function of age, a regressive approach that would leave many poorer Americans less well off and result in millions losing insurance.With all of these complications, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the essence of the Affordable Care Act remain intact. However, achieving that will still require fortitude; its enemies will surely be on the attack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Trump Era, Censorship May Start in the Newsroom", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorThis is how the muzzling starts: not with a boot on your neck, but with the fear of one that runs so deep that you muzzle yourself.Maybe it\u2019s the story you decide against doing because it\u2019s liable to provoke a press-bullying president to put the power of his office behind his attempt to destroy your reputation by falsely calling your journalism \u201cfake.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s the line you hold back from your script or your article because it could trigger a federal leak investigation into you and your sources (so, yeah, jail).Or, maybe it\u2019s the commentary you spike because you\u2019re a publicly supported news channel and you worry it will cost your station its federal financing.In that last case, your fear would be existential \u2014 a matter of your very survival \u2014 and your motivation to self-censor could prove overwhelming.We no longer have to imagine it. We got a real-life example last week in San Antonio, where a PBS station sat atop the slippery slope toward censorship and then promptly started down it.It\u2019s a single television station in a single state in a very big country. And the right thing ultimately happened. But only after a very wrong thing happened.The editorial misfire bears retelling because it showed the most likely way that the new administration\u2019s attempts to shut down the free press could succeed, just as it shows how those attempts can be stopped.Mr. Casey has been able to work for \u201c40 years as a professional smart ass,\u201d he told me, because \u201cI\u2019m not really a bomb thrower \u2014 I\u2019ve watched politicians for so many years that I know how to be strong about something without being unfriendly.\u201dAll set to go, the commentary was mentioned in a Facebook promotion for the show, which in turn caught the eye of Mr. Smith\u2019s office, which called the station to inquire about the segment.At a meeting the next Monday, Mr. Casey said, Mr. Emerson expressed concern \u201cthat the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was under attack and that this would add to it.\u201d The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides financing for public stations, including KLRN, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election has heightened fears that its financing will be cut.It also happens that Mr. Emerson had left journalism for several years to run his own advertising firm and that Mr. Smith had at one point been a client.Mr. Casey says he asked Mr. Emerson if he\u2019d be willing to come on the program and discuss it all, but Mr. Emerson declined. And that seemed to be that.But as we\u2019re learning this year, journalism has a safety net in the people who appreciate it, and the people who work in it.When I caught up with Mr. Emerson this week he acknowledged making \u201ca mistake\u201d that should not tarnish a career spent mostly in broadcast news, starting in a $1.25-an-hour job as a cameraman. \u201cI had to make a decision in what was about 20 minutes,\u201d he said.He acknowledged that \u201cclearly we always worry about funding for public television,\u201d but said that wasn\u2019t the \u201cprincipal reason\u201d for his decision to hold back the commentary. \u201cWe have to protect the neutrality of the station \u2014 somebody could have looked at it as slander,\u201d he said. The \u201ccommentary\u201d label, he said, would take care of it.Mr. Casey is satisfied with the result. But he acknowledged that it was a close call and that he was uniquely qualified to push back in a way others might not be. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be in the position of being 70 years old, and not in the position of being 45,\u201d he said, meaning that job security was not the same issue. \u201cThere\u2019s no level of heroism here.\u201dIn a week in which Congress is calling for a leak investigation into stories in The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN that led to Michael T. Flynn\u2019s forced resignation as national security adviser, heroism is what\u2019s called for. Hopefully there\u2019s enough of it to go around.Zach Wichter contributed research.Advertisement"}

It has also made some wonder about the type of content being financed through these deals.\u201cThey\u2019re not coming to the table thinking about how a brand is going to react to their behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cThey care more about being themselves than what a brand thinks of them.\u201dThat has led advertisers and media companies closer to boundaries that they may have previously considered off limits, especially when it comes to influencers who have amassed fans at least partly through shock value.The Maker unit of Disney, which zealously protects its brand, did not defend Mr. Kjellberg\u2019s videos in a statement last week, but noted that he had built his following \u201cby being provocative and irreverent.\u201d\u201cBrands need to start looking at working with influencers the same way they\u2019ve approached celebrity and athlete endorsements,\u201d said Gabe Gordon, a managing partner at Reach, an agency that specializes in social videos. \u201cMost brands, when they\u2019re investing a certain level of money in people, they\u2019re doing full background checks, they\u2019re working with P.R. agencies to understand potential risks, they\u2019re doing audits of every piece of content they\u2019ve been in or associated with.\u201dHe added, \u201cInfluencers are a bit of a challenge that way because they\u2019re creating hundreds or thousands of hours of content, and they take down videos, too, so you have to go beyond the existing content that\u2019s published, really know the person and know what they\u2019ve stood for throughout their career.\u201d\u201cThere is really a microscope now on brands\u2019 values and value messaging because of the political state of the world right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBrands can\u2019t really be completely silent, and they\u2019re being called out.\u201dAlthough Disney declined on Friday to answer specific questions about the degree to which it vetted Maker content before or after the acquisition \u2014 if at all \u2014 the company said in a statement that Maker had almost no input in the content anyway. Like other so-called multichannel networks, Maker functions largely in a back-of-house role, handling functions like marketing, sales and analytics.\u201cInfluencers who are part of the Maker network are independent creators, and Maker does not have editorial control over the vast majority of the content,\u201d the statement said.Still, Disney is moving to bring more focus to its Maker stable. Maker is expected to undergo another round of layoffs in coming days, which will include the whittling of its network to about 300 top creators, a reduction that had been planned before the PewDiePie brouhaha.

{"Headline": "Feeling \u2018Pressure All the Time\u2019 on Europe\u2019s Treadmill of Temporary Work", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter graduating with degrees in accounting and finance from a university in Finland, Ville Markus Kieloniemi thought he would at least find an entry-level job in his field. He studied potential employers, tailoring his applications accordingly.He wound up churning through eight temporary jobs over the next three years. He worked variously as a hotel receptionist and as a salesman in men\u2019s clothing stores, peddling tailored suits and sportswear.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to manage your finances or even get housing, let alone start a career,\u201d said Mr. Kieloniemi, 23, who added depth to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by accepting unpaid office jobs and internships in New York and Spain, mostly at his own expense. \u201cYou feel pressure all the time.\u201dMeet the new generation of permatemps in Europe.For those stuck in this employment netherworld, life is a cycle of constant job searches. Confidence can give way to doubt as career prospects seem to fade. Young people talk of delaying marriage and families indefinitely. And though many were grateful for any workplace experience, they were also cynical about companies that treated them like disposable labor.What follows is a selection of experiences from this growing group of permatemps: an Italian oncologist who spent almost as much time trying to find her next three-month contract as she did helping cancer patients; a French human-resources expert grappling with the psychological toll of temporary work; and, among others, a German tourism specialist who gave up his passion for a stable job in an unrelated field.The search for temporary employment can be a full-time job.Alessandra Sisco, Doctor\u2018I\u2019d fix up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 all the time, and that\u2019s your life.\u2019Alessandra Sisco, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer patients, never dreamed she would have to leave her home in Italy to find steady work. But in a stagnant economy, she was trapped in a web of short-term contracts.Since finishing her five-year oncology residency in 2012, she has only been able to get three- to five-month temporary contracts that Italy\u2019s public and private hospitals largely rely on to manage staffing. The full-time jobs often went to people from well-connected families, or those with ties to senior hospital officials.She became stuck in a loop, trying to divine whether her jobs might be extended, and struggling to land another position since they usually weren\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019d fix up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 all the time, and that\u2019s your life,\u201d Mrs. Sisco, 35, said.\u201cI was constantly looking for something else,\u201d she added. \u201cI was held back. There was no professional growth, and the earnings were low.\u201dTemporary employees are paid an average of 19 percent less than their permanent counterparts, according to Eurofound, the research arm of the European Union.In November, she interviewed for hospital internships in New York. \u2018\u2018At least there would be hope for the future,\u201d she said.Temporary work has become widespread in the United States, too, where the explosion of the so-called gig economy has made job-hopping the new norm for a growing pool of young workers. But the situation is verging on the extreme in Europe, giving the perniciousness of the problem the potential to play on an entire generation. Millions of people across Europe are searching for work amid jobless rates that are still nearly twice as high as in the United States.Relocating would mean having to do a new five-year residency on top of her extensive training and experience. But the prospect of spending her career as a doctor doing temporary work was more than she could bear.\u201cWhen I started thinking of moving, I stopped thinking about what I was not getting,\u201d said Mrs. Sisco, who hopes to be able to move her family and start a new life in the coming months.\u201cWhen you see that you\u2019re actually appreciated for your work, you\u2019re happy,\u201d she added excitedly. \u201cFinally, I will have peace of mind because I know everything I\u2019ve worked for is going to be earned and deserved.\u201dStarting a family or getting a mortgage can be a major challenge.Sam Mee, Social Analysis and Research \u2018I was forced to put off big life decisions.\u2019At 36, Sam Mee thought his life would have been settled by now. A career in research and social policy. A family. A home. At the very least a cellphone.But even the basics can be unachievable, as Mr. Mee finds himself on a treadmill of temporary contracts.\u201cI had this idea that I would study hard, work hard, get the job I studied for, then ask my girlfriend to marry me,\u201d Mr. Mee said.A British national, Mr. Mee thought his master\u2019s studies in social analysis would make him attractive to companies and nongovernmental organizations that research behaviors and trends. \u201cI\u2019d buy a house and have kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the dream.\u201dHe moved to Amsterdam before the financial crisis to be with his girlfriend and to start his career. Yet in a country where more than 20 percent of job contracts are temporary, he was never able to find permanent work in his area of expertise. He now has a temporary contract with a firm that does business-to-business collections, including calling airlines to settle outstanding invoices.The temporary-work trend is accelerating around Europe, as employers seek more flexibility to fire and hire workers, and shun permanent contracts with expensive costs and labor protections. In Spain alone, the government reported that 18 million temporary contracts were handed out last year, compared with 1.7 million long-term jobs.\u201cI want a career more than anything, but I feel like I\u2019m in a position where a 25-year-old would be,\u201d said Mr. Mee, who has hired a job coach and set up his own website to improve his prospects. \u201cI was forced to put off big life decisions.\u201d\u201cYou feel stuck,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re young, you have a lot to offer, but no one will give you a chance.\u201dTemporary contracts blocked more than just his career. Real estate agents were reluctant to deal with Mr. Mee, and it was impossible to get a mortgage at the bank. Nor could he obtain a credit card, lacking steady income. Even mobile-phone companies would not give him a contract; he had to get one through his girlfriend, who has a full-time job as a midwife.\u201cBut in the end,\u201d Mr. Mee said, \u201cI was like, to hell with it. I\u2019m not going to keep putting life on hold because the market won\u2019t let me.\u201dRecently, he asked his girlfriend to marry him. She accepted; the wedding is planned for this year.\u201cWe want to do everything 50-50,\u201d he said, before pausing. \u201cBut everything\u2019s just a little bit tight.\u201dA revolving door of work exerts a psychological toll.Charles Terraz, Human Resources\u2018It\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of burnout or depression.\u2019Charles Terraz never used to live with chronic stress, health scares or recurring anxiety. But these days, they have become close companions as he bounces through a series of temporary contracts as a recruiter at industrial and pharmaceutical companies, each of which leaves him a little more drained and racked by uncertainty about his career.Armed with a master\u2019s degree in human resources and economics and business degrees, Mr. Terraz, a native of Lyon, France, was confident of finding work at a large company. Yet in the country\u2019s struggling economy, where more than 80 percent of all new hires are temporary, that proved virtually impossible.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stress about the future and money,\u201d said Mr. Terraz, who is 29. \u201cThe fear of becoming unemployed weighs on you.\u201dThat precariousness fueled sleepless nights and nagging self-doubts. He sustained severe stress and recurring migraines, spending two weeks recovering in a hospital. \u201cIt was a horrible experience,\u201d he said.Today, Mr. Terraz is a recruiter at a French pharmaceutical company, but only for six months. The stress over money and finding the next job remains. \u201cYou have to keep a smile and be mentally strong,\u201d he said. In private, though, \u201cyou feel excluded from society.\u201d\u201cThree years ago, I had dreams, ambitions for a great career,\u201d he added. \u201cBut right now I have nothing. It\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of burnout or depression sometimes. If I was the only one this was happening to, O.K., but most of my friends are in the same position.\u201dTreating employees like disposable labor is bad for companies, too.Joost Minnaar, Scientist\u2018In one fell swoop, all our excitement and engagement vanished.\u2019Joost Minnaar, an industrious Dutchman, had a dream job in Barcelona, Spain, as a nanotechnologist at a German company with 30 other scientists, working on new developments for television, tablet and computer displays. Each held one-year renewable contracts, with the promise of potentially going full time after two years.It never happened.The company was hiring groups of 30 scientists at a time on temporary contracts, which management would let expire to avoid the cost of hiring people full time. Mr. Minnaar and his colleagues discovered that they were the third such group in four years.It is an increasing reality across Europe. Since 2012, just 20 percent of temporary workers have made the leap to full-time work, according to Eurofound.\u201cWe were trapped in the strategy of this multinational, which was just waiting to discard us after two years of hard work,\u201d Mr. Minnaar said. \u201cIn one fell swoop, all our excitement and engagement vanished.\u201dMorale slumped.\u201cProductivity became really bad, and people started to become really disengaged from work, which was strange because we were doing interesting stuff,\u201d he recalled.Employees dragged their feet on projects and openly looked for jobs. Others grew wary of colleagues, whom they viewed as competitors for any permanent jobs that might arise elsewhere at the firm.\u201cBy doing this, the company was destroying their own workers,\u201d said Mr. Minnaar, who is 30. \u201cThe lesson was, if you treat people like this, if you don\u2019t give them security or trust over the long term, they won\u2019t do a good job for you.\u201dTaking any job just to survive means dealing with trade-offs.Cristian Meiler, Tourism and Hospitality\u2018There\u2019s a sense that you\u2019ve given in, that you\u2019ve surrendered.\u2019Cristian Meiler had always worked in tourism and hospitality in Spain, following a passion that had grabbed him as a teenager. He served as a hotel bellhop in his hometown, Barcelona, manned reception desks, and waited tables at restaurants. He is fluent in five languages and has a degree in hotel management.Despite decades of experience, he never managed to land a prized full-time job. When a permanent offer did come, however, he hesitated.Mr. Meiler had been working a temporary job at a sports equipment company\u2019s call center in Barcelona to help supplement his income from short-term contracts at hotels and cruise ships, where he welcomed and checked in guests. Accepting a full-time gig as a service representative at the sports company in Munich would mean abandoning his career path.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that you\u2019ve given in, that you\u2019ve surrendered,\u201d said Mr. Meiler, 35, who remembers accompanying his mother, a tour guide, as a youth around Spain. \u201cYou want to stay on the path you\u2019ve been working on for so long.\u201cThen I thought, what if there is no better job waiting for me?\u201d he continued. \u201cI needed work. I needed stability.

Some of the bodies were found inside the stricken raft.\u201cIt\u2019s really strange that smugglers would take off the engine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are becoming increasingly cruel.\u201dThe tragedy was a stark reminder about what may lie ahead during the main migration season in Libya, the principal springboard for most African migrants seeking to get to Europe.Although the illegal trade usually slows for the winter, at least 228 people died in January while trying to reach Italy, mostly in smaller boats and inflatable vessels, according to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.The bodies that washed up near Zawiya, a smuggling hub 30 miles west of Tripoli, the capital, appeared to be a further sign that greater numbers were starting to set off.\u201cUsually they wait until April or May, and it continues until October,\u201d Mr. Almosrti said. \u201cIf they are starting strong like this, it means we could see a lot of deaths this year.\u201dThe route between Libya and Italy was the site of a record number of deaths last year, when at least 4,579 people died, Fabrice Leggeri, head of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, said last week. The toll for 2015 was about 3,000.Libya was the departure point for many of the estimated 180,000 migrants who reached Italy last year. The migrants, most of whom are fleeing war or poverty in Africa, often arrive in Libya after arduous journeys through the desert.They entrust their lives to smuggling gangs that have set up along a 230-mile stretch of coast in western Libya, which is largely controlled by an array of rival militant groups.But the plan depends largely on assistance from the United Nations-backed unity government, one of several rival governments in Libya. The unity government has limited control in Tripoli and in a few towns along the coast.News of the Italian training program, however, may be accelerating the migrant crossings. Mr. Di Giacomo, of the International Organization for Migration, said some smugglers were urging migrants to leave now before the Libyan Coast Guard could thwart their departure.\u201cThe smugglers are using this information to convince the migrants that this is the moment to go,\u201d Mr. Di Giacomo said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s a way of doing more business.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Easy Trade Win for Trump", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFor years, the conventional wisdom has held that a more seamless flow of people and goods across borders is good for America. But the 2016 presidential campaign put on life support the idea that there is broad national consensus on free trade.The Ex-Im Bank is a rare government entity that supports American jobs \u2014 1.4 million over the last eight years \u2014 at no cost to taxpayers. The agency is funded entirely by user fees, which generated about $4 billion in profit during my tenure.This offers Mr. Trump an opening to pursue trade policies that can advance the broad bipartisan goals of increasing exports and supporting American jobs. He should announce his full support of Ex-Im and put a stamp on the agency with immediate appointments to Ex-Im\u2019s five open board seats. A functioning board could begin approving the about 40 transactions held up since last year, which are worth about $30 billion and could support almost 200,000 jobs.There is no need for new legislation or spending. This is low-hanging fruit for a president who ran on a promise to create jobs.Mr. Trump showed skepticism about Ex-Im on the campaign trail. But so did Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan when they ran for president, and both became supporters of the agency after taking office. Mr. Trump should follow suit.A strong Ex-Im is just a start. If Mr. Trump is committed to America \u201cwinning\u201d in international trade, he needs to confront the destructive idea popular among some Republicans that the United States government doesn\u2019t even need to be at the table when deals are being made.America\u2019s economic competitors \u2014 China chief among them \u2014 aren\u2019t debating whether their governments should help domestic companies win business abroad. They are using every tool they can to support jobs at home and outcompete America, including export credit agencies, state-owned enterprises and generous development loans.To cite just one example, in 2015 alone, the Chinese government provided about $500 billion in loans and insurance to support Chinese exporters. That is about the same amount of financing Ex-Im has provided over its entire eight-decade history.In this increasingly mercantilist environment, American businesses don\u2019t need lectures from Capitol Hill on the beauty of free markets and the evils of corporate welfare. They need support. Without it, America is unilaterally disarming while the rest of the world is heading into the arena with more weaponry.Mr. Trump could also lead more United States trade missions, which historically have chief executives accompanying the commerce secretary on overseas trips to win business and close deals. President-elect Trump wasn\u2019t shy about going to Indiana to convince Carrier to keep jobs in the country. Why not broaden his focus as president to salesman and negotiator-in-chief abroad?By showing the country the clear benefits to American businesses of selling more goods and services abroad, Mr. Trump could turn down the heat on the trade debate. The president\u2019s support for Ex-Im would send a powerful signal that he is willing to fight aggressively for the interests of American exporters and the more than 10 million American workers whose jobs depend on selling to vast pool of consumers who live outside American borders.Fred P. Hochberg was chairman and president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States from 2009 to 2017.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Campaign Over, President Trump Will Hold a (What Else?) Campaign Rally", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In an extraordinarily swift return to politicking after a tumultuous first month in office, the White House on Wednesday said President Trump will hold the first campaign rally of his four-week-old administration on Saturday.The rally, to be held in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla., is an indication that Mr. Trump, who has sometimes felt isolated in the White House, is eager to get outside of Washington and relive the rapturous reception that greeted him during the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump exulted in large crowds assembled at cavernous venues throughout his 2016 bid, and spent the first days of his presidency quibbling over how many Americans attended his inauguration.On Wednesday, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump answered a question about whether his administration was flirting with xenophobia and racism in part by noting the support he received in the election.\u201cI just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had \u2014 306 Electoral College votes,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous enthusiasm out there.\u201dNot long after, in a posting on Twitter, Mr. Trump invited his nearly 25 million followers to attend the Saturday evening event, which will take place just up the coast from his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach where he plans to spend the weekend. It will be his third weekend in a row on Florida\u2019s Gold Coast.\u201cWe are going to put America back to work,\u201d a message accompanying the posting said. \u201cWe are going to put people before government.\u201dThe White House would not provide any additional information about the rally. Officials referred questions to a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s political organization, who also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u201cIt\u2019s being run by the campaign,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday, without elaborating. He would not say why the president would be holding a campaign rally so soon after taking office.The rally will be only the second public appearance by Mr. Trump outside of Washington since he took office. On Friday, he is scheduled to visit a Boeing plant in North Charleston, S.C., for the unveiling of the aerospace manufacturer\u2019s new Dreamliner aircraft.Mr. Trump filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2020 re-election campaign on Jan. 20, the day he was sworn in. That allowed him to continue to accept contributions \u2014 including proceeds from the sales of his popular red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats \u2014 without running afoul of the law.Mr. Trump ended the 2016 campaign flush with funds, in part because of substantial sales of the hats. At the end of 2016, he had $7,611,702.92 cash on hand and no debt.Mr. Trump had vowed to move quickly to put his policy agenda in place once in the White House. But his effort to use executive power to crack down on immigration has faltered in the face of legal challenges, and his administration has yet to issue a proposal either for repealing the health care law he railed against during the campaign or enacting the tax overhaul he has promised.Larry M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group, said he was not aware of any president having held a campaign rally this early in his tenure.\u201cUsually, they are too busy trying to get their administration in place,\u201d Mr. Noble said. \u201cMore importantly, normally the president wants to delay candidate status so that he can travel as president making speeches, announcing new policies and actions, promoting his agenda and attacking his opponents in Congress without having to use campaign funds.\u201dBarack Obama did not file his statement of candidacy for re-election until April 2011, more than two years after he took office, while George W. Bush waited until May of 2003 and Bill Clinton until April of 1995.Mr. Trump may be moving now, Mr. Noble said, to ensure he can address a friendly crowd devoid of protesters.\u201cMy guess is that he intends to control who is invited to the rally and press access by calling the rally a candidate event and paying for it out of campaign funds,\u201d Mr. Noble said. \u201cIf it was an official White House event, he would have less control over it.\u201dMr. Trump is likely to travel to the event on Air Force One and will have a sizable contingent of Secret Service and staff aides with him, as presidents always do when they travel. Campaign finance laws dictate that the cost of such a flight be shared between the campaign organizing the rally and the White House.It is not abnormal for a sitting president to hold a political rally in the months before an election, and Mr. Trump has said he plans to campaign actively for Republicans who support him and against Democrats who seek to stymie his agenda. But Mr. Trump\u2019s return to the campaign trail on Saturday is unusually early. Even the midterm congressional elections for members of Congress are still 21 months away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zimbabwe\u2019s Rulers Use a Monument\u2019s Walls to Build a Legacy", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGREAT ZIMBABWE NATIONAL MONUMENT, Zimbabwe \u2014 Black Africans could never have built the Great Zimbabwe monument, or so the white rulers used to say.Clearly, it was made by the Phoenicians or other visitors from faraway places, they insisted. Never mind that archaeologists and carbon dating had confirmed the obvious: that the monument was constructed by the ancestors of the Africans living nearby.But the fight over the Great Zimbabwe did not end with independence.As President Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party have clung to power through violence, they have increasingly turned to the Great Zimbabwe for vindication.In the monument\u2019s elegantly curved stone walls \u2014 at the center of a ruined city where thousands lived centuries ago \u2014 Zimbabwe\u2019s current leaders have also found a rationale for their party\u2019s 37 uninterrupted years in power.Mr. Mugabe spoke of the \u201cmajestic Great Zimbabwe monument whose African origins the imperialists wished so much to denigrate.\u201d Then he ate a slice of a cake baked in the image of the monument that weighed 92 kilograms, or 203 pounds.\u201cWhether it\u2019s the Rhodesians or the ZANU-PF government, they always want to try and milk some political glamour out of this very illustrious story,\u201d said Nelson Chamisa, an opposition leader who served between 2009 and 2013 as the information and communication technology minister of a coalition government, referring to the white minority who controlled the country known as Rhodesia until independence.But the Great Zimbabwe, Mr. Chamisa said, remained off limits to any opposition events.\u201cWe\u2019ve never tried in the past to go there,\u201d he said. \u201cOur colleagues in ZANU-PF guard it jealously. They would probably think that we want to snatch away its legacy.\u201dSprawling across 2,000 acres in southern Zimbabwe, the Great Zimbabwe was a city founded in the 11th century and inhabited, at its peak, by more than 10,000 people.Stone walls, rising as high as 32 feet and held together without mortar, formed large enclosures in which lived various communities. It was believed to be the capital of the local Shona people, who built similar, though smaller, communities throughout the region. Zimbabwe means \u201chouse of stone\u201d in the Shona language.\u201cIf you see how these things were built, it can tell you how these people were very intelligent,\u201d said Lovemore Mugwisi, who was visiting the Great Zimbabwe on a rainy morning with his wife and four children. \u201cThere was no cement, no mortar; people were doing it just using their bare hands, and these structures still stand. Even before the settlers came here, there was civilization.\u201d\u201cEthiopia was never colonized so the interpretation was from the Ethiopians themselves,\u201d said Mr. Ndoro, a Zimbabwean archaeologist who worked as a curator at the Great Zimbabwe in the early 1990s. \u201cBut when you come to southern Africa, where you have a long history of colonization, there was an attempt by the colonial governments not to attribute anything of significance to the local populations because then their superiority would be challenged.\u201dThe ruins were the capital of the Queen of Sheba, or the site of King Solomon\u2019s Mines, the arguments went.European explorers, some financed by Cecil Rhodes, the British industrialist whose company created the colony bearing his name, said the Great Zimbabwe was built by the Phoenicians, or Egyptians, or a previous white civilization in Africa that was returning to reclaim its rightful place.Archaeologists, starting as early as 1905, said that local Africans had erected the Great Zimbabwe, a conclusion reinforced by carbon dating and other scientific developments over the decades.Analysts say it was around 2000 \u2014 when Mr. Mugabe faced serious challenges to his authority \u2014 that he saw the value in forging ties between his party and the Great Zimbabwe. The party began holding events at the site, including celebrations for National Unity Day and Mr. Mugabe\u2019s birthday parties.\u201cIt\u2019s manipulation of the highest order when it comes to the past,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen you use monuments to get political mileage, you should at least invest in them so that your conscience is clear,\u201d Mr. Pikirayi said.On a rainy morning, Tongai Dzimiri, 27, and his brother, Nyasha, 12, led their family\u2019s cows to graze on the Great Zimbabwe\u2019s grounds.\u201cWe grew up being told that this was built by our ancestors,\u201d Mr. Dzimiri said.But the present situation in Zimbabwe, he said, had instilled doubts in his mind \u2014 a sign that, in the continuing fight over ownership of the Great Zimbabwe, the new history and past promised by Mr. Mugabe were being questioned by the reality of a Zimbabwe ground down by corruption, poverty and misrule.\u201cMaybe some passers-by built this,\u201d Mr. Dzimiri said, as he kept an eye on his cows, a couple of which had disappeared behind one of the Great Zimbabwe\u2019s stone walls. \u201cMaybe some white people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Girds for Political Brawl Over Looming Speaker Vacancy", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith all the political focus in New York City trained on the 2017 mayoral race, there is another important battle being quietly waged, for perhaps the second-most-powerful job in the city.Yet the only votes that matter in this contest are not from constituents; this race, for City Council speaker, will be determined by other Council members and the city\u2019s Democratic county leaders, who are normally the deciding factor in efforts to wrangle the necessary votes.The current speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, who is to deliver her State of the City address on Thursday, cannot run for re-election because of the term limits law; several other prominent Council members are also serving their last term.Though the race will not be decided until January, the looming vacancy is already swathed in all the bare-knuckled, back-room intrigue of old-time New York: Promises are offered; deals are made. And a leading candidate suddenly emerges.But this year\u2019s contest offers additional intrigue in the form of Mayor Bill de Blasio; what role he will play is an open question.In the last race, the mayor intervened immediately after his election, helping tip the balance in favor of Ms. Mark-Viverito over Councilman Dan Garodnick of Manhattan. Mr. de Blasio used his influence as the first Democratic mayor in two decades to support a coalition of liberal Council members, many of them also newly elected, that backed Ms. Mark-Viverito.The vote, in January 2014, was expected to be so close, recalled Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, a Queens councilwoman, that on the morning it was held, the liberal coalition gathered at a downtown restaurant to walk with Ms. Mark-Viverito to City Hall \u2014 out of concern for last-minute defections. (In the end, with the outcome clear, Mr. Garodnick dropped out and Ms. Mark-Viverito captured all 51 votes.)But that outcome represented a break from recent tradition, in which the county leaders of the Bronx and Queens have teamed up to back a speaker candidate from Manhattan. In exchange, Council members from those boroughs expect to get chairmanships on key committees such as finance and land use.For the borough leaders, it is an alliance of convenience. The Bronx, for instance, would not back a Queens candidate \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 because that would concentrate too much power in the other borough. But a Manhattan candidate is seen as palatable to both, partly because the Manhattan Democratic machine is relatively weak.All that bodes well for the hopes of Councilman Corey Johnson, who represents District 3, which stretches from Greenwich Village and Chelsea to part of the Upper West Side, and Councilman Mark D. Levine, whose District 7 extends from the Upper West Side to Washington Heights. They, along with Ms. Ferreras-Copeland, are thought to be the front-runners for speaker.On a recent night, Mr. Levine and Mr. Johnson glad-handed their way through a banquet hall in Queens, gliding between tables topped with red-and-white balloons, and meeting near the Valentine-themed buffet near the shrimp.\u201cWhat\u2019s everybody doing here tonight?\u201d Councilwoman Elizabeth Crowley of Queens joked, knowing full well why they and a bevy of other Council members had come to Antun\u2019s, in Queens Village, for a Queens County Democratic fund-raiser.Ms. Ferreras-Copeland was also making the rounds, as were others who are seen more as long shots: Jimmy Van Bramer and Donovan Richards Jr. of Queens and Ydanis Rodriguez, of Upper Manhattan. Potential hopefuls for the speakership from Brooklyn, like Robert E. Cornegy Jr. and Jumaane D. Williams, face a harder road that most likely does not run through Queens. (Neither was present at the banquet hall.)\u201cThe race remains totally open,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cEvery one of us are friends and we work together and we are allies. It\u2019s an unusual contest in that way.\u201dThe speaker, as leader of the Council, derives much of his or her power from the key role the body plays in land and finance, including the ability to halt development projects, give final approval to the city\u2019s budget and pass New York City laws. The speaker can also control whether or not a bill even gets a vote.Ms. Ferreras-Copeland is thought to be the mayor\u2019s favored candidate. But she would have to overcome a lack of support from the party committee in her own borough.Democratic strategists and elected leaders described in interviews how lingering animosities may shape the race. Representative Joseph Crowley, the chairman of the Queens committee, and State Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, the power behind the Bronx committee, are still irked over the outcome of the last Council speaker race, when their candidate, Mr. Garodnick, was defeated by the liberal coalition and the mayor\u2019s maneuvering.Back then, Ms. Ferreras-Copeland bucked the county leaders to back Ms. Mark-Viverito and was later made chairwoman of the Finance Committee. But her decision earned her Mr. Crowley\u2019s displeasure.Ms. Ferreras-Copeland played down the feud. \u201cIt\u2019s like cousins,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you fight and sometimes you want the favorite toy and you can\u2019t have it. But you\u2019re still family.\u201dMr. Crowley, too, dismissed the notion of lingering hard feelings. \u201cI think, from a county standpoint, that all boats rise when people stick together,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s the lesson that\u2019s been learned here.\u201dThe fallout of the 2014 speaker race also crosses borough lines.Ms. Mark-Viverito, whose district, District 8, includes East Harlem and part of the Bronx, was elected with the support of the Brooklyn County Committee, headed by Frank Seddio. Mr. Crowley and Mr. Seddio have not spoken since, according to two people close to the men who asked not to be identified so as not to jeopardize relationships with them.All of these machinations have handicappers already contemplating the possibilities.They note that Mr. de Blasio may have less sway over the outcome this time around. After his strong election victory in 2013, Mr. de Blasio was an incoming first-term mayor who appeared to be riding a wave of progressive energy. But after a rocky first term he is wounded by multiple investigations into his fund-raising and actions in government; and many Council members have grown impatient with what they see as his garbled management style.What is more, Mr. de Blasio is heavily dependent on Mr. Heastie to push his agenda in Albany \u2014 which may induce him to either stay on the sidelines or back a Bronx-Queens candidate.Only four people have held the speaker position since the Council was expanded to its current size in 1992. The first was Peter F. Vallone, a powerful Queens councilman who held the Council\u2019s top job, then called majority leader, before charter changes in 1989 increased the Council\u2019s powers. Term limits forced Mr. Vallone from office in 2002, and in the jockeying to replace him, the Bronx-Queens alliance emerged as kingmaker, electing a Manhattanite, A. Gifford Miller, as speaker. Four years later, Christine C. Quinn, of Manhattan, took his place, again with support from Bronx and Queens. She outmaneuvered Mr. de Blasio, then a councilman from Brooklyn, who ran against her for the speakership.The selection of Ms. Mark-Viverito broke the pattern.But term limits have also affected the job by forcing candidates to come out early. All Council members know they have only two terms to make a mark, so those interested in serving as speaker begin lining up backing midway through their first term. They also have to be re-elected in November, although serious challengers to incumbents rarely emerge.In the end it is a numbers game. There are 51 Council members, meaning that at least 26 votes are needed to be elected speaker. The candidates are already counting.\u201cYou probably don\u2019t get to where you\u2019re putting together the 26-plus until December,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to see it go into overdrive because time is of the essence.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Written by a prominent gay filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, \u201cWhen We Rise\u201d is a 50-year history of the gay rights movement beginning on Feb. 27, told through four characters who suffer \u2014 and often triumph over \u2014 family rejection, landlord discrimination, gay-bashing, police harassment, legislative defeats and AIDS.But the world is a different place than it was when ABC first commissioned the project four years ago. Barack Obama was in the White House, and gay leaders were celebrating a series of court and statehouse victories, which would soon include the Supreme Court\u2019s recognizing a constitutional right to marry by same-sex couples. After President Trump\u2019s election, questions that seemed largely settled about gays in American society \u2014 same-sex marriage, equal treatment in the workplace and in housing \u2014 suddenly seem in doubt.Mr. Trump is hardly a champion of gay rights, and Mike Pence, his vice president, has a record of explicit opposition to gay rights measures. Mr. Trump could well end up altering the ideological composition of the Supreme Court that handed down the marriage decision.Still, as celebration has given way to intense anxiety, Mr. Black argues that the election\u2019s outcome has made the mini-series even more urgent.\u201cWe did not create this series for half a nation,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cI believe that most Americans, including Americans who voted for Donald Trump, will fall in love with these real-life families and absolutely relate to their stories when they tune in.\u201d\u201cThis is a story that could have been told before,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cBetter late than never.\u201dSipping a cup of tea after flying in from his home in London, Mr. Black, 42, teared up here as he recounted learning that ABC would devote a four-night block of prime time to his work. (\u201cWhen We Rise\u201d originally was set for four consecutive nights; the second episode has now been delayed a day to make way, fittingly enough, for Mr. Trump\u2019s first State of the Union address.)It was a far cry from the struggle he endured to get a movie made of his screenplay for \u201cMilk,\u201d the story of Harvey Milk, the openly gay member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who was assassinated in 1978. Mr. Black said that he went nearly broke financing it and that a studio committed to it only after Sean Penn had signed on to play the title character. Mr. Black won an Academy Award for best original screenplay.\u201cWhen We Rise\u201d is the latest in a series of works by Mr. Black focusing on gay issues. He wrote \u201c8,\u201d a play based on the closing arguments over the constitutionality of a voter initiative in California in 2008 prohibiting the marriage of same-sex couples. The production of the play was used to raise money for the legal battle that resulted in the initiative\u2019s being thrown out of court.This has long presented a challenge for anyone seeking a neat narrative arc for this history. \u201cBy necessity if you\u2019re going to tell the story of the L.G.B.T. civil rights movement, you are only going to be able to tell a slice of a slice of a slice,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cWhat invariably happens is there will be people screaming that it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Well, it can\u2019t tell the whole story.\u201dMr. Black focuses largely on San Francisco \u2014 familiar ground, since that was where \u201cMilk\u201d was based. But other cities were arguably as politically significant \u2014 New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington and Minneapolis among them \u2014 and are largely absent from this account.But Mr. Black needed characters whose lives spanned the contours of this history, who would give continuity to a long story and who are, in three cases, played by different actors at different stages of their lives.Mr. Jones, who is played as an adult by Guy Pearce, said that while some details in the production were not true to what he experienced, \u201cWhen We Rise\u201d captured the spirit and themes of the movement that has absorbed much of his life. \u201cIt could be truthful without being accurate,\u201d he said.The fraught relationship between Dr. Socarides and his gay son has been the subject of several articles (including one I wrote in October 1995 for Out Magazine). But Mr. Socarides said there are details about his coming out to his father that he decided to share for the first time with Mr. Black.\u201cIn that interaction with my father, my father takes out a gun and puts it to his head and threatens to shoot himself,\u201d Mr. Socarides said. \u201cWhich actually happened. No one ever knew about it. It was really intense. I hadn\u2019t told anybody that ever, because I was trying to protect him, or I guess in some way I was embarrassed or ashamed of myself. I felt enough time had passed.\u201dThe tussles President Clinton had with gay leaders \u2014 in particular, over his support of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as being between a man and a woman \u2014 seem tame in this political environment, where gay leaders are girding for Mr. Trump, and Republicans who control state legislatures, to roll back protections for gays and lesbians. Still, this new climate does not appear to have shaken ABC.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change things for us,\u201d said Channing Dungey, the president of ABC Entertainment. \u201cThis is a true story involving actual events, involving real people. We are not coming at this from a political place or trying to make a political statement. This feels like an emotional story that we just want to share.\u201dMr. Black said that if he had learned anything from this work, it is that the gay rights movement is a story of triumphs followed by setbacks. Mr. Trump\u2019s election, he said, is just another turn in this road.\u201cWe are in a period of backlash right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI would give anything for this to be less topical. But this series shows our history is a pendulum, not a straight line.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eurozone Agrees to Greece Talks in Exchange for Bailout Payments", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Eurozone finance ministers agreed on Monday to begin negotiations in Athens as soon as next week over much-needed overhauls in exchange for bailout payments, with Greece appearing to win a reprieve from the crippling austerity that it has faced for years.Greece does not have to make another major debt repayment to its creditors until the summer. But with elections due in France, Germany and the Netherlands this year, the country\u2019s bailout is threatening to become a major political issue across the region. European officials are particularly eager to head off another full-blown crisis if only to avoid giving succor to far-right parties in those polls.Representatives of Greece\u2019s main creditors will \u201cgo back to Athens in the very short term,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, which brings together the finance ministers of the 19-nation eurozone, said on Monday.\u201cI\u2019m very happy with that outcome,\u201d he told a news conference in Brussels.The negotiations are the latest step in Greece\u2019s yearslong debt crisis.That issue of austerity has also formed a crucial divider between two of Greece\u2019s main creditors \u2014 Germany and the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F., which has not yet said whether it would join a third bailout for the country, has argued for some measure of debt relief for Athens. Berlin and many other eurozone members have chafed at cutting Greece any slack, reluctant to seek taxpayer support for more aid.Monday\u2019s meeting appeared, however, to raise the specter of easing off on those tough conditions, with Mr. Dijsselbloem suggesting there could be a \u201cshift from austerity to structural reforms\u201d as part of efforts to draw the I.M.F. into the bailout.Greece\u2019s government welcomed what it called a \u201cpolitical agreement\u201d and said that it had accepted creditors\u2019 demands that structural changes to the country\u2019s economy be enshrined in legislation. If agreed, those changes would come into force after the country\u2019s third international bailout expires at the end of next year.The I.M.F. also gave an upbeat assessment of the meeting. It said in a statement that it welcomed Greece\u2019s progress in meeting the fund\u2019s requirements and said that, on that basis, it had agreed to send officials to negotiate for reforms.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election in Indonesia\u2019s Capital Could Test Ethnic and Religious Tolerance", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 In one of the most contentious campaigns in the history of Indonesia\u2019s young democracy, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the governor of Jakarta, is battling on two fronts: in the court of public opinion and in the court of law.\u201cIt\u2019s actually the political elite that ignite this religious tension again and again,\u201d Mr. Vermonte said, noting that religion and ethnicity were not campaign issues in the 100 other provincial- and district-level elections also taking place on Wednesday.\u201cIn Jakarta, the national political elite have chosen to play this card, which is dangerous,\u201d he said.Mr. Basuki, known as Ahok, was charged with violating Indonesia\u2019s anti-blasphemy law during a speech to fishermen in September, before the start of the campaign.At the opening of his trial in December, Mr. Basuki emphatically denied that this constituted blasphemy, arguing that his remark was aimed at \u201cunscrupulous politicians\u201d who he said were trying to use ethnicity and religion to undercut him.If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison.Since the trial\u2019s start, the governor has continued campaigning while appearing in court each Tuesday. Campaigning officially ended on Saturday for a mandatory three-day \u201ccooling-off period,\u201d a welcome respite given the political tensions.Mr. Basuki, 50, formerly Jakarta\u2019s deputy governor, took over as governor in 2014 from Mr. Joko, who was elected president. The grandson of a tin miner from Guangzhou, in southern China, Mr. Basuki is now trying to become Jakarta\u2019s first directly elected Christian governor.But his straightforward style, a contrast to that of many soft-speaking Javanese politicians, has also earned Mr. Basuki detractors, who call him brash and arrogant.Even before the campaign, numerous ethnic and religious slurs were directed at Mr. Basuki, and dubious reports about him were shared on social media, including claims that he was a puppet of Beijing and that he was plotting to help China take over Indonesia.The campaign has become so divisive, pitting those who admire Mr. Basuki\u2019s can-do style against those who are convinced that he hates Islam, that it has strained friendships and led to screaming around dinner tables.\u201cIt pulls so many negative threads together,\u201d said Kevin Evans, a longtime Jakarta-based political observer. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of the \u2018otherness\u2019 here.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s this Islamist exclusiveness here. This kind of \u2018Talibanization\u2019 of the public domain.\u201dThat regulation was challenged in October, when the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country\u2019s largest body of Islamic clerics, issued an edict declaring it \u201charam,\u201d or forbidden, for Muslims to vote for a non-Muslim candidate. The edict is not legally binding, as Indonesia is not an Islamic state and it has a secular Constitution and government.However, emboldened hard-line Islamist groups held the series of protests in Jakarta and other cities late last year, demanding that Mr. Basuki be jailed for blasphemy \u2014 or even lynched \u2014 including a demonstration in the capital in early November in which Muslim protesters set cars on fire and battled with riot police officers.There was growing suspicion that the organizers of the protests had included Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Mr. Joko\u2019s predecessor as president, whose son, Agus Yudhoyono, is also running for governor of Jakarta.The elder Yudhoyono held two heated news conferences during the campaign, first to deny allegations that he was secretly financing the protests, and also to reject assertions by Mr. Basuki\u2019s trial lawyers that he had requested the Indonesia Ulema Council to issue the fatwa prohibiting Muslims from voting for a Christian.Regardless of who orchestrated the protests, they had the desired affect: Mr. Basuki\u2019s once-comfortable double-digit lead all but vanished by December.A series of recent polls suggest, however, that he has regained some lost ground, and he now has a lead of four to eight percentage points over his closest challenger, Anies Baswedan, a former minister of higher education. Agus Yudhoyono, who, like his father, is a former army officer, is third.If none of the three candidates receives one vote more than 50 percent, and pollsters and analysts consider it unlikely any will, then the top two finishers will compete in a runoff election in April.Based on current poll numbers, analysts say that Mr. Basuki would have a tougher time in a runoff against Mr. Anies, who is Muslim and emphasized his Islamic credentials on the campaign trail. They said a vast majority of Mr. Yudhoyono\u2019s supporters would choose Mr. Anies in a runoff against Mr. Basuki.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Paid Hour a Week for Sex? Swedish Town Considers It", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA local official in Sweden has a novel proposal to improve work-life balance and lift the local birthrate: give municipal employees an hourlong paid break each week to go home and have sex.Noting that \u201csex is also a great form of exercise and has documented positive effects on well-being,\u201d Mr. Muskos suggested that local municipal employees could use an hour of the workweek already allotted for fitness activities to go home and have sex with their spouses or partners instead. The motion, which is expected to be voted on in the spring, needs a simple majority to be passed by the 31-member council. As of now, opinion on the council is divided.When Mr. Muskos introduced the motion on Monday, some council members giggled while others said they were not amused. But befitting a progressive country which has long been perceived as a beacon of sexual enlightenment \u2014 including blissfully kitsch performances at the Eurovision Song Contest \u2014 the proposal was taken in stride.Mr. Muskos told colleagues the proposal was no joke, though he acknowledged practical problems like enforcement. It would be difficult to tell, for example, if an employee eschewed sex in favor of a walk in the country.Malin Hansson, 41, a sexologist and specialist in reproductive health in Gothenburg, applauded the initiative, arguing that sex reduced stress, improved sleep and strengthened immunity, while enriching intimacy between couples. \u201cIf it was up to me, I would introduce this across the country,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIn Sweden, sex is considered just another activity.\u201dBut Professor Dellve, who is married and has two daughters in their 20s, said it would be ridiculous for employers to mandate when employees should become intimate. \u201cIt is wonderful to see your spouse during the workday, but you don\u2019t necessarily want to have sex,\u201d she said.Stefan Nilsson, a Green Party member who sits on the health and welfare committee of the Swedish Parliament, said he was skeptical that taxpayers would want their money to finance work-hour sex, but allowed that the idea might be a canny investment in physical activity, noting that healthier workers cost the government less.Others were less persuaded.Tomas Vedestig, 42, a left-leaning municipal councilman in Overtornea, said that when Mr. Muskos made his pitch, his colleagues were so taken aback that they thought they had misheard him. Mr. Vedestig said the proposal was intrusive and threatened to embarrass people who do not have sexual partners; do not want to have sex; or had medical conditions that precluded sex.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the employer\u2019s business to say, \u2018Go home for an hour and make babies,\u2019\u201d he said. And some proponents worried the proposal was too stingy: \u201cI spoke to a couple of older gentlemen who said, \u2018One hour? That is not enough time.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Friends No More? Jorge P\u00e9rez and Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 Who does Donald J. Trump call when he needs a wall built on the United States-Mexico border? An old friend, it turns out: the luxury-condo king of Miami, Jorge P\u00e9rez \u2014 often described as the Donald Trump of the tropics.Mr. P\u00e9rez, 67, a major figure in the Miami art world and a developer who has helped remake the city\u2019s skyline, publicly supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But he said Mr. Trump lost little time in phoning him after his victory in November. In fact, the emails and calls between the two men \u2014 who have known each other as business partners for several decades \u2014 actually increased.\u201cYou have to give him credit for reaching out,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said of these conversations in an interview in the living room of his waterfront Miami mansion.Though Mr. P\u00e9rez passed on Mr. Trump\u2019s January request for help constructing the wall \u2014 pointedly quipping, \u201cOnce it\u2019s finished, which side of it will I be on?\u201d \u2014 he said Mr. Trump still seemed eager to enlist him in joining the administration. Despite differences regarding both foreign affairs and federal housing policy (Mr. P\u00e9rez said, \u201cI\u2019m a strong believer in increased housing subsidies.\u201d), the president offered him the job of deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary Ben Carson\u2019s No. 2, Mr. P\u00e9rez said. Again, he declined.In late January, he said, President Trump was back on the phone, discussing the job of assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, the position responsible for promoting United States interests throughout Latin America. Mr. P\u00e9rez, the son of Cuban exiles who was raised in Colombia, said no once again. Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, asked about these offers and the current state of the relationship between President Trump and Mr. P\u00e9rez, declined to comment.Mr. P\u00e9rez, in describing his rejection of the job offers, explained, \u201cI\u2019m not a yes man.\u201d He added, \u201cI told him he needs to hear the voices of people that are not dependent on him, that are going to give him the truth.\u201d To that point, he then told Bloomberg News in a Jan. 31 article he thought the idea of a Mexican border wall was \u201cidiotic.\u201dThat was more than two weeks ago. Despite sending fence-mending letters to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal email account, and getting confirmation from Mr. Trump\u2019s personal secretary that they had been read, Mr. P\u00e9rez hasn\u2019t heard a word back.Yet these two milieus \u2014 the White House and the cultural arena \u2014 now eye each other with both open hostility and wariness toward anyone unwilling to pick a side. Mr. P\u00e9rez may see himself as a trusted back channel between apprehensive cultural figures and President Trump: \u201cI would help him try to see the different opinions of the art world,\u201d he said. Much of the art world, however, hardly seems in the mood for such a genteel t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate.\u201cJorge P\u00e9rez is wasting his time,\u201d insisted Amanda Keeley, the owner of Miami\u2019s Exile Books, when asked about Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s efforts to reach out to the president. Ms. Keeley led fellow Miami artists to demonstrate at the Womens March on Washington last month. \u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t interested in listening,\u201d she said, \u201cand you can\u2019t have a conversation with someone who doesn\u2019t want to listen to you.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said of Mr. Trump. \u201cOr at least he was, until I made a statement about the wall.\u201d The last time they spoke? \u201cHim saying \u2018please come to Palm Beach and Mar-a-Lago, we\u2019re spending weekends there.\u2019\u201d And now? \u201cIt\u2019s gone to radio silence, to zero,\u201d he said.Mr. P\u00e9rez said he couldn\u2019t fathom this turnaround in Mr. Trump: \u201cWe used to talk about Cuba as a place to do business \u2014 a Trump hotel, a Trump golf course.\u201d So during that last phone call, he asked Mr. Trump point-blank, did he intend to tighten the trade embargo against Cuba? \u201cHe gave me no real answer \u2014 not yes, not no. Just \u2018We\u2019re going to see what happens, I haven\u2019t decided on that yet.\u2019\u201d Next came Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order announcing a travel ban, prompting an exasperated Mr. P\u00e9rez to give his fateful Bloomberg interview.Meanwhile, Mr. P\u00e9rez is focusing on art. Later this month, he returns to Havana with Mr. Sirmans, visiting artists\u2019 studios as a prelude to the June exhibition of \u201cOn the Horizon: Contemporary Cuban Art From the Jorge M. P\u00e9rez Collection,\u201d drawn from more than 160 artworks that he recently donated.\u201cCubans came here and built up great businesses, bringing in Latin Americans who have a love for the city.\u201d He concluded, \u201ccontemporary Latin American art and culture is what should go with that movement.\u201dMr. P\u00e9rez stopped short and chuckled to himself. \u201cFirst I need to be able to talk to him.\u201d He\u2019s still waiting for the phone to ring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Risky Business for C.E.O.s: An Invitation From Trump", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor the nation\u2019s top executives, a summons to the White House has long been a much-coveted honor.Now, less than a month into President Trump\u2019s administration, it\u2019s become something to be ducked, at least for some.A Trump invitation \u201chas become a double-edged sword because the population is so divided,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who organizes meetings of chief executives there.Then, executives were clamoring to make the cut, even those who had been cool or in some cases hostile to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Well over 100 chief executives approached Mr. Schwarzman and the Trump transition team angling to be included.Only two people declined, citing time pressures: Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.The final list of 16 included such business luminaries as Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric; Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Bob Iger of Disney; Mary Barra of General Motors; and Virginia Rometty of IBM.Soon after, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors, Travis Kalanick of Uber and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo were added, buttressing the group\u2019s expertise in technology and consumer products.Then Mr. Trump was inaugurated and in short order unleashed his divisive immigration order, leading to chaos at airports and nationwide protests. Exactly one week later, on relatively short notice, he convened the first meeting of the forum, with live television coverage from the State Dining Room of the White House.Even though nearly every company represented in the forum issued a statement that to varying degrees distanced it from the immigration order or even denounced it, the images of the meeting risked looking like an endorsement of the Trump administration and its policies.Images of Mrs. Nooyi, an immigrant born in India (and now a citizen), who sat next to Mr. Schwarzman and within camera range of Mr. Trump, seemed especially incongruous.Mr. Kalanick was the first on the forum to feel the wrath of consumers. Protesters accused Uber of \u201ccollaborating\u201d with Mr. Trump and chained themselves to the doors of the company\u2019s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Soon after, the hashtag #DeleteUber trended on Twitter. Within four days of the immigration order, 200,000 users had deleted the Uber app, and one of the company\u2019s rivals, Lyft, reported that downloads of its own app had more than doubled.When I contacted him this week, Mr. Kalanick said: \u201cJoining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.\u201dProtest flared and a social media boycott campaign took root after the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, joined Mr. Trump\u2019s 28-member Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, announced in January, and then praised the president\u2019s pro-business policies on CNBC.Some Disney employees organized demonstrations in three cities this week, demanding that Mr. Iger resign from the forum, even though he didn\u2019t attend the first meeting because of a conflict with a long-scheduled company board meeting. The demonstrations drew about 120 protesters, the company said.At the same time, Out & Equal, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, praised Mr. Iger\u2019s membership in the forum in a letter to the company, citing his support for workplace equality and ability to influence the president.Mr. Schwarzman himself received some criticism from a few Schwarzman scholars, who receive support under a program he established for study in China. In a letter to the scholars explaining his role in advising Mr. Trump, Mr. Schwarzman wrote: \u201cIn life you\u2019ll often find that having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice. However, I have always believed one\u2019s obligation is to work for the common good.\u201dAs the Uber experience suggests, the risks of engaging with Mr. Trump are highest for companies with direct exposure to consumers, especially those who can easily switch to a competitor less identified with the Trump brand. General Motors and PepsiCo could face more consumer reaction; the banks and money managers less so; and industrial concerns like General Electric even less.At the same time, the benefits of being part of the forum and gaining the ear of the president are obvious: Virtually every Fortune 500 corporation has vitally important interests affected by the federal government, from antitrust, labor and trade policies, to tax reform and bank regulation, including changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.The comment seemed to underscore the degree to which Mr. Trump has turned regulation of Wall Street over to the bankers he railed against during the campaign. (Curiously, given Mr. Trump\u2019s stated hostility to Dodd-Frank, Mr. Dimon is on record as supporting many aspects of the legislation, saying it has made the banking system safer but has also made it more difficult for smaller banks to compete.)A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.And refusing Mr. Trump\u2019s invitations risks a presidential Twitter broadside, something that is unprecedented in American political and business history and whose impact is still being assessed. Yahoo Finance last week said it had sifted through more than 34,000 Trump tweets and identified attacks on 62 businesses, including at least two represented in the forum, General Motors and Boeing.(I asked the White House on Thursday for comment on its interaction with business leaders, but received no response.)Optics aside, Mr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said the president\u2019s overtures to executives represented a welcome change from the Obama administration, which largely ignored big business and summoned bankers to Washington to browbeat them publicly over the financial crisis. By comparison, Mr. Trump embraced members of his business forum as \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d and said he welcomed their ideas.\u201cThere\u2019s always the danger that chief executives will be used as photo ops,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld acknowledged. But he praised Mr. Trump\u2019s decision \u201cto give chief executives a seat at the table\u201d and said he had talked to at least half of the participants since the meeting. \u201cThey\u2019re telling me they found him very receptive to their ideas and willing to listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve said they\u2019re holding each other accountable to be truthful and candid and to raise key issues with him.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld has met with Mr. Trump since the election and offered advice. \u201cHe\u2019s very charming and open to new ideas,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen business executives melt in his presence.\u201dCharles Elson, a professor and expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware, also praised the president for reaching out to business leaders. He said he disagreed with Mr. Kalanick\u2019s decision to resign.\u201cWhen the president calls, you should go to see him, regardless of your political persuasion, out of respect for the office,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cAs a chief executive with a duty to your shareholders, it\u2019s your obligation to do so, like him or not.\u201dMr. Schwarzman\u2019s office made a similar point when I inquired this week. \u201cSteve has advised presidents from both parties in the past and feels a duty to help any administration that calls on him if he\u2019s able to do so for the good of the country,\u201d Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzman, said.Still, everyone I spoke to agreed that there were lines they wouldn\u2019t cross. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree\u201d with the president, Mr. Elson said. \u201cIf he asks you to take a political position, you can say no. And if he asks you to endorse something where you have a deep philosophical objection, you shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Smithers, who expanded on her husband\u2019s bequests to help recovering alcoholics at a Manhattan treatment center and, in the process, won a consequential lawsuit that empowered benefactors and their families to oversee their charitable contributions, died on Monday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 83.The cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, said her son, Christopher, the president of the Christopher D. Smithers Foundation, which is named for his grandfather, a wealthy investment banker.The Smithers name is generally associated with the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. For many years the Smithers Alcoholism Treatment and Training Center treated thousands of people, including celebrities like John Cheever, Joan Kennedy and Dwight Gooden, mostly at what was once a stately 55-room home on East 93rd Street.But Mrs. Smithers also attached the family name to a groundbreaking legal development in philanthropy when she sued St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan over its administration of a $10 million endowment left by her husband, R. Brinkley Smithers.Mr. Smithers, a recovered alcoholic who said he took his last drink in 1953, died in 1994.In 2003, The New York Times described Mrs. Smithers as \u201cthe real godmother of the new style of philanthropy\u201d \u2014 a more muscular demeanor in which donors aggressively monitor how their gifts are spent by grantees.\u201cIf money is given for a certain cause or to be spent in a certain way,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I think it should be used for that cause or spent in that way.\u201dAfter her husband\u2019s death, she discovered that some of the endowment, which was restricted to financing alcoholism treatment, had been diverted by the hospital to pay for other expenses.Citing Mrs. Smithers\u2019s diligence in monitoring the bequest as her husband\u2019s administrator, New York State\u2019s highest court granted her standing to sue. It ruled that while the state attorney general had jurisdiction over charities, there is \u201cno substitute for a donor, who has a \u2018special, personal interest in the enforcement\u2019\u201d of the terms of his gift.The hospital agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement that led last year to the foundation\u2019s establishment of the Smithers Family Center for Alcohol and Substance Abuse at Columbia University Medical Center.

{"Headline": "Issues Facing Republicans in Replacing Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ever since Democrats began pushing the Affordable Care Act through Congress more than seven years ago, Republicans have been trying to come up with an alternative. Candid conversations leaked from a conclave of Republican lawmakers in Philadelphia last month, and public comments since, show they are nowhere near agreement.The leaked audio recordings revealed that Republicans recognize the technical complexity and political difficulty of the task they have set for themselves: repealing the law known as Obamacare and replacing it with a new plan that, in the words of President Trump, provides \u201cbetter health care for more people at a lesser cost.\u201dWhat follows is a summary of the thorny questions with which Republicans in Congress are struggling. These are not just academic quandaries. People\u2019s lives could depend on the answers. And time is short. Insurance companies have about three months to decide what kinds of health plans, if any, they will sell to the public in 2018.Many of the choices facing Republicans are variations of a fundamental question: how much of the Affordable Care Act to keep, and how much to discard?More than half of the 20 million people who gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act did so through Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people. Medicaid, begun as an adjunct to the main cash welfare program a half-century ago, has gradually become a pillar of the American health care system, covering more than 70 million people and financing more than 40 percent of all births.The 2010 health care law, as written by Democrats, required all states to expand Medicaid eligibility. But the Supreme Court said that requirement violated the Constitution by placing \u201ca gun to the head\u201d of states. So the expansion became voluntary.To date, 31 states have expanded Medicaid, and 19, including Florida and Texas, have not. The federal government pays at least 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries. Governors who supported the expansion of Medicaid eligibility, including Republicans like John R. Kasich of Ohio, Rick Snyder of Michigan and Brian Sandoval of Nevada, want to keep it. That would be impossible if congressional Republicans repeal this part of the law, as they tried to do in a budget bill that was vetoed by President Barack Obama last year.Many who gained coverage under Medicaid are poor adults who were not previously eligible. Republicans in Congress have not decided whether to let states continue such coverage. Nor have lawmakers decided whether additional states will be allowed to expand eligibility, with the same generous contribution of federal funds.Medicaid is now an open-ended entitlement. Anyone who meets federal and state eligibility criteria is entitled to benefits.Many Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, would like to roll back the expansion of Medicaid and give each state a fixed amount of money for each beneficiary or a lump sum for all of a state\u2019s Medicaid program \u2014 a block grant. Under such proposals, states would have more freedom to set benefits and program rules, but the federal government would probably cut Medicaid spending compared with the amounts projected under current law.\u201cGovernors should be exceedingly wary of block grants\u201d for the Medicaid program, said former Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat. If Congress gives states more discretion but less money, he said, \u201cgovernors will have to use their enhanced flexibility to make impossible choices \u2014 which individuals to cut from the program, or which benefits to eliminate.\u201dOne of the more popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing condition like cancer, heart disease, diabetes or AIDS. President Trump has said he would like to keep this provision. Many Republicans in Congress agree, but the version they propose is, in some ways, different from the existing law.Congressional Republicans would provide some protection against discrimination based on pre-existing conditions. To obtain full protection, consumers would need to maintain \u201ccontinuous coverage.\u201d Under some Republican proposals, consumers with chronic illnesses could be charged higher premiums if they had a significant break in coverage lasting, say, more than nine or 10 weeks.Republicans say this more limited form of protection would provide an incentive for consumers to obtain and maintain coverage. But Democrats say it is unfair because people have gaps in coverage for many legitimate reasons, and they may be unable to pay the premiums needed to maintain it.In such cases, he said, patients could be charged \u201ca premium they cannot afford.\u201dRepresentative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is drafting a bill to encourage continuous coverage, but said he wanted to make sure that people with pre-existing conditions would always have access to care.\u201cI\u2019ve seen cancer up close,\u201d Mr. Walden said. \u201cMy mother died of ovarian cancer, my sister-in-law of brain cancer.\u201dOne of the biggest questions dividing Republicans is what to do about the taxes and tax increases adopted as part of the Affordable Care Act to help pay for the coverage of millions of low- and moderate-income people.The new revenue comes from taxes and fees imposed on consumers who go without health insurance; high-income taxpayers; manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs; makers of certain medical devices; and insurance companies. In addition to an annual fee on insurers, the law imposes a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage, the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d opposed by labor unions and employers.Some Republicans, like Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, say the government should keep some of the revenue collected under the Affordable Care Act to help pay for a replacement plan.By contrast, House Republican leaders and some Republican senators want to eliminate most or all of the taxes. \u201cAfter spending seven years talking about the harm being caused by these taxes, it\u2019s difficult to switch gears now and decide that they\u2019re fine, so long as they\u2019re being used to pay for our health care bill,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee.\u201cAll of the Obamacare taxes need to go as part of the repeal process,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Republicans are also divided over a proposal to limit the value of health benefits that employers can provide to employees tax-free. Under current law, employees do not have to pay federal income tax on contributions that employers make to their health insurance. House Republicans say this tax break amounts to an open-ended subsidy for employer-sponsored insurance, encouraging employers and employees to choose more expensive coverage than they otherwise would.Mr. Ryan reaffirmed his support for limiting the tax break last week, but said that whether Congress would approve the change \u201cwas an open question.\u201dSeveral other questions vex Republicans as they try to write a replacement. How will they ensure a smooth transition to the market-oriented health care system they want to create? How much time should elapse between the passage of a repeal bill and its effective date?If the federal government spends tens of billions of dollars to subsidize the purchase of health insurance, will it set standards for that insurance? Will it still require insurers to cover maternity care, mental health services and treatment for drug abuse?Should Congress cut off funds for Planned Parenthood clinics, which receive Medicaid money for birth control, cancer screenings, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and many other services? Mr. Ryan has said that federal funds for Planned Parenthood would be cut off in a repeal, but some Republicans say that would be a political mistake.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Agency Can Demand Answers About Foreclosed Homes, Judge Rules", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a time when many Republicans are urging President Trump to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge has now upheld its authority to issue a subpoena in a housing finance investigation.Judge Nancy G. Edmunds of Federal District Court in Detroit has ruled that one of the nation\u2019s largest providers of seller-financed homes must comply with a demand for documents and other information from the consumer agency.The bureau has been looking into whether the terms of some of these sales violated federal truth-in-lending laws. In recent years, these kinds of deals have ballooned in poorer neighborhoods as lower-income Americans have found it harder to obtain mortgages and as private investment firms have stepped in to offer alternative financing since banks often will not lend to them.The agency filed a lawsuit in November after one such provider, Harbour Portfolio Advisors of Dallas, refused to comply with an administrative subpoena.A federal judge upheld the the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s authority to issue a subpoena in a housing finance investigation.Authorities in New York sent subpoenas to several companies to determine how common contracts for deeds were in the state. And the Missouri attorney general warned residents to be wary of abuses with contract-for-deed sales.Lucy Morris, a lawyer for Harbour Portfolio, did not respond to a request for comment. Harbour had argued that the consumer agency\u2019s subpoena was too burdensome and that it sought too much information.In its investigation, the bureau has also been examining National Asset Advisors and a related firm, National Asset Mortgage; both work with Harbour Portfolio to sell the homes.After the 2008 housing crisis, Harbour Portfolio bought around 7,000 single-family homes in bulk sales from Fannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage finance firm. Harbour paid $10,000 or less for each of these homes in most cases, then sold them \u201cas is\u201d to buyers for sometimes as much as four or five times the purchase price, The Times found in its investigation last year.Judge Edmunds said in a 12-page ruling that the agency\u2019s authority to issue the subpoena was \u201cnot \u2018plainly lacking,\u2019\u201d borrowing language that Harbour had used in its challenge.\u201cThere are plausible grounds to believe that respondents may have information related to a violation\u201d of the federal Truth in Lending Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, she noted.Still, the judge, who was appointed in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush, did not address whether the home financing companies had done anything wrong because the agency had yet to bring an enforcement action.Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy for the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said, \u201cThis is an example of how the bureau stands up for Americans \u2014 it is a nimble agency that doesn\u2019t fall victim to the typical loopholes that companies use to get around the rules Congress has put in place to protect our pocketbooks.\u201dYet the ruling comes at a time when the future of the bureau is very much in doubt.Mr. Trump has not yet said what he intends to do with the agency, but he has broadly criticized the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which created the agency and overhauled financial regulation after the financial crisis. The president pledged \u201cto do a big number\u201d on Dodd-Frank and signed an executive order indicating his administration\u2019s intention to chisel away at major provisions of the legislation.Some Republicans in Congress have urged Mr. Trump, among other things, to eliminate the agency outright or fire its director, Richard Cordray, and replace him with a more business-friendly administrator. Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, recently said that Mr. Trump had not yet decided whether he would oust Mr. Cordray before the end of his term in 2018.On CNBC on Thursday, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called the bureau a \u201crogue agency.\u201dMr. Hensarling made his comments on the same day a federal appeals court in Washington agreed to rehear arguments in a case that could determine whether Mr. Trump could remove Mr. Cordray from office without a legal justification. The appellate court agreed to sit en banc, meaning the full United State Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would hear the case, rather than a three-judge panel.Consumer advocates have praised the agency for taking on thorny issues like mandatory arbitration clauses in financial contracts, firms that service student debt payments and the mortgage servicing operations of large banks. In September, the agency reached a $185 million settlement with Wells Fargo over the opening of as many as two million unauthorized accounts for the bank\u2019s customers.Harbour Portfolio is led by Charles A. Vose III, who in 2010 raised more than $60 million from wealthy investors to begin buying foreclosed homes. The homes Harbour bought from Fannie Mae were located in about a dozen states, including Florida, Michigan and Ohio.Mr. Vose did not respond to a request for comment.Referring to complaints from Harbour that the agency\u2019s demands were too burdensome for its four employees, Judge Edmunds on Wednesday wrote that 30 days would be \u201cample time to respond to the bureau\u2019s modest demands.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ed Garvey, Leader of N.F.L. Players\u2019 Union, Dies at 76", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEd Garvey, who led the National Football League players\u2019 union to two strikes during a dozen years as its executive director and later became a progressive political activist and officeseeker in his native Wisconsin, died on Wednesday in Verona, Wis. He was 76.The union confirmed his death.Mr. Garvey joined the N.F.L. Players Association in 1971 seeking to bring economic and social freedom to players who had experienced little of either in the era before free agency. Atop his wish list was eliminating a rule, named for the league\u2019s commissioner, Pete Rozelle, that restricted the ability of a player, once his contract was over, to sign with another franchise by requiring his new team to compensate his old team with players or draft choices.If teams could not agree on compensation, Mr. Rozelle determined it.\u201cIn 1974, we struck over that: \u2018no freedom, no football,\u2019\u201d Mr. Garvey said in 2010 during an interview on \u201cI Remember,\u201d a public television program in Milwaukee. The summertime strike ended in early August, and the players instead pursued a legal remedy to the so-called Rozelle Rule in court. The rule was found in 1975 by a Federal District Court judge to have violated antitrust laws; an appeals court upheld the ruling almost a year later.But even the court victory did not greatly change the power that clubs had over their players, Mr. Garvey said.\u201cThe owners said they wouldn\u2019t bid\u201d for players, he recalled, \u201cand common sense said they wouldn\u2019t.\u201dWhen the players went on strike in 1982, they stayed off the field until mid-November, causing the reduction of the season to nine games from 16. The union demanded that 55 percent of the league\u2019s gross revenue be paid to the players.\u201cThey didn\u2019t like that,\u201d Mr. Garvey told the \u201cI Remember\u201d program, adding that Jack Kent Cooke, the Washington Redskins\u2019 owner, \u201cthought it was communism and others thought it was socialism.\u201cIt seemed like capitalism to me,\u201d Mr. Garvey said.Although the league said that it had achieved its financial goal \u2014 some estimates put the final percentage of revenue below 55 percent \u2014 the players were not all united. Within weeks of the new labor deal, players were seeking Mr. Garvey\u2019s resignation, some unhappy with his handling of negotiations, some demanding an independent audit of union funds.Dave Anderson, a sports columnist for The New York Times, criticized Mr. Garvey for agreeing to a deal that he could have gotten before the strike began and for not demanding free agency. He said that the \u201cunion has caved in because of Ed Garvey\u2019s goofs.\u201dBut Mr. Garvey concluded that the strike had been worthwhile because of the increased money that it brought the players. And after surviving a vote of confidence by player representatives, Mr. Garvey resigned from the union in June 1983 to be a deputy state attorney general in Wisconsin.DeMaurice F. Smith, the union\u2019s current executive director, said in a video posted on its website that Mr. Garvey had successfully challenged the league\u2019s \u201cright to own men\u201d and had \u201cpushed the union philosophically toward freedom issues.\u201dEdward Garvey was born on April 18, 1940, in Burlington, Wis., and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and its law school. A job with a law firm in Minneapolis led to his work for the players\u2019 union.His departure from the union led to a political career in which he was known for a liberal voice on issues like the environment and campaign finance in his private law practice and as an unsuccessful candidate for governor and the United States Senate.\u201cHe was an economic justice warrior,\u201d said Scot Ross, the executive director of One Wisconsin Now, a progressive advocacy organization. \u201cHe thought you should get a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work. And he was a social justice warrior.\u201dMr. Garvey was renowned in recent years for organizing the annual Fighting Bob Fest, a gathering for progressives featuring speakers and panels and named for Robert M. LaFollette Sr., a former Wisconsin senator and governor. Mr. Garvey described Mr. LaFollette\u2019s politics as \u201csynonymous with reform, getting corporate money out of politics and getting rid of the spoils system in government.\u201dMr. Garvey\u2019s liberal politics placed him at odds with Scott Walker, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican governor, who has clashed with labor unions. Working with the Republican-controlled state Legislature, Mr. Walker has cut taxes, expanded school vouchers and limited early voting. Mr. Ross said that Mr. Garvey thought the governor was \u201cin the pocket of corporate special interests.\u201dAt a speech in Madison in 2011, Mr. Garvey exhibited his trademark wit when he said he had been asked to say \u201csomething nice\u201d about Mr. Walker. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he lies,\u201d Mr. Garvey said, \u201cBut that he has such a higher regard for the truth that he uses it sparingly.\u201dMr. Garvey is survived by his wife, Betty, and three daughters. Further information on survivors was not immediately available.He never won elective office. During his losing race for the Senate in 1986, his past in sports was used against him by his opponent, Robert W. Kasten. Mr. Kasten ran a television commercial that contended that $750,000 from the N.F.L. players\u2019 union had \u201cdisappeared\u201d when Mr. Garvey was its executive director. Mr. Garvey sued for libel, and Mr. Kasten eventually conceded that the ad was inaccurate. In settling the suit the next year, Mr. Kasten said that he had not intended to challenge Mr. Garvey\u2019s integrity.\u201cOf course he meant to challenge my integrity,\u201d Mr. Garvey said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he spent more than $200,000 to air that commercial repeatedly even after I offered proof that it was false and demanded that it be taken off the air.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "They Waited 5 Years (and 45 Minutes) to Marry", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVows9 PhotosElena Sarkissian had plenty of time to figure out whether she wanted to marry Demetrios Orfanoudis before their wedding on Jan. 21. First came five years of long-distance dating. Then, just before the wedding itself, came an unexpected stretch of time with nothing to do but sit and think.\u201cI ended up spending 45 minutes circling the cathedral,\u201d said Ms. Sarkissian, 44, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman in Manhattan. Alone in the back seat of a rented Bentley in her Anna Maier couture wedding gown, with only the car\u2019s driver for company, \u201cI had no phone, and no watch,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I knew we were running more and more late for the ceremony. It was such a stress. But we just kept circling.\u201dAbout 60 of the 150 guests invited to Ms. Sarkissian and Mr. Orfanoudis\u2019s wedding had gotten stuck on a rented bus, inching through the protest to get them to the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on East 74th Street for the 4 p.m. wedding. The bus, carrying friends and family, who came from as far as Athens and who were staying at a Midtown hotel, did not make it for 40 minutes or more.Ms. Sarkissian knew she couldn\u2019t start the wedding with nearly half her guests in transit. And so she circled. And as she did, she didn\u2019t feel anything approximating jitters. She felt something else entirely: the kind of eagerness born of waiting for years to seal the deal on a romance in which everything went right.\u201cI married my best friend,\u201d Ms. Sarkissian said after an hourlong traditional Greek Orthodox ceremony that included chanting, crowns and a priest in robes. Despite the transit chaos and the late start, all the Holy Trinity pews were full, and the mood was buoyant. \u201cIt was really stressful and exhausting. But I feel like the luckiest girl alive.\u201dMs. Sarkissian and Mr. Orfanoudis met in September 2011 after a monthlong telephone courtship set in motion by a friend of Ms. Sarkissian, Dr. Mary Vouyiouklis Kellis.Dr. Kellis, who lives in Cleveland, remembers going out with her soon-to-be husband, Augustine Kellis, and Ms. Sarkissian. \u201cElena said to Augie, \u2018I\u2019m really tired of dating the same kind of guy in New York,\u201d\u2019 Ms. Kellis said. She asked if he had any solid, intelligent, eligible friends worth meeting.\u201cHe told me all his friends were married,\u201d or else an unprintable word that means not especially nice, Ms. Sarkissian said. \u201cAnd then Mary said to him: \u2018What about your cousin Demetri? He\u2019s such a great guy.\u2019\u201dFor Ms. Sarkissian, a classic dark-haired beauty who grew up in Michigan and moved to Manhattan when she was 30 after becoming a cancer epidemiologist in Chicago, \u201ca great guy\u201d was starting to mean someone other than the hard-charging finance professionals she had gotten used to dating.\u201cThese types of guys were very driven, and they weren\u2019t ready for anything real,\u201d said Ms. Sarkissian, who switched careers from medicine to real estate after several medical school friends enlisted her to help them find apartments to buy. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to have fun when you\u2019re dating in New York. But I do think it\u2019s hard to find someone you connect with on different levels, in terms of both your everyday enjoyment of your time together and on higher levels that are more important, like values, character, family and your goals for the future.\u201dEven harder, at least for Mr. Orfanoudis and Ms. Sarkissian, was finding those higher-level matchups in the same city. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. Like Ms. Sarkissian, Mr. Orfanoudis had dated many women in Washington before he found what he called \u201cmagic\u201d in New York.\u201cMy parents always wanted me to meet someone I could happily spend my life with,\u201d said Mr. Orfanoudis, who, like Ms. Sarkissian, was raised Greek Orthodox; he cannot personally rebut the stereotype about traditional Greek families\u2019 obsession with seeing their children settle contentedly into marriage, he said. \u201cI had been hearing some of that for a while. I just never found the right person.\u201dWhen he finally traveled to Manhattan to meet Ms. Sarkissian, after that month of getting-to-know-you phone calls during the summer of 2011, he knew he had struck romantic gold.\u201cWe just hit it off,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has this great smile and huge dimples, and she\u2019s an aggressive, very professional businesswoman, but when you scratch the surface, she turns out to be this superfun person who laughs at my jokes. Which is important.\u201dMs. Sarkissian felt just as comfortable around the tall and gentle Mr. Orfanoudis, though she admitted she was concerned there might be no physical attraction. \u201cHe had seen a lot of pictures of me on Facebook, but he had only one or two on there of himself, that were very old,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect. And then he sent me a picture of him that was kind of awkward and not very flattering.\u201dAdding to her unease was the dawning awareness that she had already fallen for him.\u201cThe fact that we had solidified our friendship on the phone before we met actually provided a bit of anxiety,\u201d she added. \u201cYou don\u2019t spend a month on the phone with someone you\u2019re not invested in.\u201dFortunately, she said: \u201cThe attraction was there. He was very warm, and we had this easy exchange that translated from our phone conversations. We just rolled right into the relationship.\u201dThey have been rolling ever since, with Mr. Orfanoudis and Ms. Sarkissian making the commute from Washington to New York, or vice versa, almost every other weekend. (\u201cI\u2019ve explored every method of transportation,\u201d Mr. Orfanoudis said, \u201cbut no matter what you do, it takes four hours.\u201d) In addition to savoring the moments together in New York and Washington, they often go farther afield.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just as easy for us to spend the weekend somewhere else, so we\u2019ll go for weekend trips,\u201d Mr. Orfanoudis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to places like the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Miami, Vegas.\u201dWhen Mr. Orfanoudis proposed to Ms. Sarkissian in September, he had recently been admitted to the New York bar, paving the way for him to become a full-time New Yorker and a full-time partner to Ms. Sarkissian.\u201cI wanted to kind of move things along so she could be a part of everything,\u201d he said.Ms. Sarkissian, who accepted Mr. Orfanoudis\u2019s proposal after he traveled to her hometown, Bloomfield Hills, Mich., to ask for her parents\u2019 approval, rallied.\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 had two requests after we were engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cOne was that we try to get it done A.S.A.P. because his mother was gravely ill. And the other was that he wanted to get married before his 50th birthday, which was Feb. 8. So I had to hustle.\u201dMs. Sarkissian\u2019s father, Miran, is Armenian. Her mother, Angela, is Greek; they split time between homes in Athens and Bloomfield Hills. Ms. Sarkissian calls herself \u201cGreek lite\u201d compared with the more traditional Mr. Orfanoudis. But aside from Ms. Sarkissian\u2019s modern-leaning decision to have both her parents walk her down the aisle, and the blessings at the altar from an Armenian archbishop, Khajag Barsamian (who flew to a meeting with the pope at the Vatican just afterward), their wedding was a study in traditional Greek Orthodoxy.Ms. Sarkissian\u2019s cousin Lisa Chicouris, of Chicago was the koumbara. In addition to providing an extra set of hands to hold the bridal bouquet of cala lilies and white roses, her responsibilities included interchanging the rings three times after the Rev. John Vlahos blessed them; the triple interchange refers to the holy trinity and represents the couple\u2019s devotion.Col. Alex Stathopoulos, a longtime friend of Mr. Orfanoudis from Washington, was the koumbaros. He exchanged the crowns three times before Father Vlahos placed them on the heads of the bride and groom to symbolize the couple\u2019s intertwined lives and the joining of their souls.Most of the service was chanted rather than spoken, though much of the chanting was in English instead of the customary Greek. Adding to the drama of the chanting, which at times took on a deep baritone, was the cathedral\u2019s Byzantine mosaics and religious iconography. In keeping with tradition, neither Ms. Sarkissian nor Mr. Orfanoudis spoke during the service, not even to utter \u201cI do.\u201d Instead, they were led by Father Vlahos in a ceremonial walk around the wedding table three times, symbolizing the circle of eternity and signifying their first steps as husband and wife.That, perhaps, was the easiest journey they had taken all day.When the guests and wedding party filed out of Holy Trinity, the same bus that ferried the 60 late arrivals, as well as the Bentley Ms. Sarkissian killed time in, were idling outside, waiting to take everyone to the Yale Club.Ms. Sarkissian\u2019s father settled in near a piano player once there and offered a theory on marriage, and of patience.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting a long time for Elena to decide to get married,\u201d Mr. Sarkissian said. \u201cBut our being anxious was not part of the equation for her. It didn\u2019t matter. Waiting a few extra minutes for her wedding didn\u2019t matter, either. What matters is that she came up with the right person.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arun Jaitley, India\u2019s Finance Chief, Aims to Spur Economy Hit by Cash Shortage", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe budget plan was presented by the minister of finance, Arun Jaitley, in a highly anticipated annual ritual. It included tax cuts for lower income taxpayers and small businesses, even as it came close to sticking with the country\u2019s target for reducing its budget deficit.\u201cWith this gradual approach, I\u2019ve ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation without compromising investment,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said in a two-hour speech before the Indian Parliament.The budget presentation came as five states in India prepare to go to the polls beginning Feb. 4th, including India\u2019s largest state of Uttar Pradesh. The prime minister is hoping to win that state to gain control over the upper house of Parliament, demonstrating strength in advance of national elections in 2019.His budget plan received mostly positive responses for taking measures to increase consumer demand and jobs while still adhering largely to the deficit plan. It calls for reducing the deficit to 3.2 percent of G.D.P. for next year from 3.5 percent in the current fiscal year, a bit short of the government\u2019s previously stated target of 3 percent.\u201cThe economy needs the spending to give consumption a boost, but the government is also giving weight to fiscal prudence,\u201d said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil Ltd., an Indian credit rating agency.Mr. Jaitley said his budget had increased capital investment by about 25 percent and raised rural and farm spending by 24 percent.The budget also cuts income taxes to 5 percent from 10 percent for people making between $3,700 and $7,400 annually. But he imposed a 10 percent surcharge on higher-income taxpayers.Small businesses with annual revenue of up to $7.5 million \u2014 96 percent of Indian businesses \u2014 would see their tax rates cut to 25 percent from 30 percent, Mr. Jaitley said.Much of the spending in rural areas will go to building roads, with the aim of increasing efficiency and access to markets while providing jobs, Mr. Joshi said. The budget also substantially increased India\u2019s expenditure on its rural employment program, to $710 million, the highest ever.Current laws do not require parties to report the sources of contributions of less than 20,000 rupees, or about $300. Mr. Jaitley\u2019s plan would reduce that to 2,000 rupees, or about $30.However, one activist, Jagdeep Chhokar, a founding member of the Association for Democratic Reforms, a nonprofit organization, dismissed the change as ineffectual, saying donors would simply slice contributions into $30 pieces. To achieve transparency, he said, the government will have to proscribe cash contributions entirely, instead requiring they be made digitally so they can be traced.The tax cuts for the middle class and spending increases in rural areas, where most Indians still reside, would help boost discretionary spending that had suffered after the currency ban, said Deepak Parekh, the chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation, one of India\u2019s largest mortgage lenders.\u201cIt is extremely well thought-out,\u201d Mr. Parekh said of the budget, in a telephone interview, crediting the government with being \u201cfrank enough to say the economy has taken a hit\u201d and proactive enough to provide a needed spending boost.Mr. Joshi said the government\u2019s budget, if executed well, could help restore some of the jobs lost. In addition to plans to increase capital spending, Mr. Modi\u2019s budget plan aims to build 10 million new affordable homes for the poor in rural areas by 2019.\u201cThe jobless will get support if these programs are executed well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Health Proposal Would Redirect Money From Poor to Rich", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthThe plan would make major changes in how health care is financed for Americans who don\u2019t get coverage from work. It would greatly expand the number of Americans who could benefit from federal help in buying health insurance, but it would change who benefits most from that support.The Republican plan would alter both of those programs, changing the winners and losers. It would substantially cut funding for states in providing free insurance to low-income adults through Medicaid. And it would change how tax credits are distributed by giving all Americans not covered through work a flat credit by age, regardless of income.That means that the biggest financial benefits would go to older Americans, like, say, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. If he didn\u2019t have a job in the Trump cabinet and access to government coverage, a 64-year-old multimillionaire like him would get the same amount of financial assistance as someone his age, living in poverty, and he would get substantially more money than a poor, young person.The idea of matching tax credits to age makes some sense. Older people tend to have higher medical bills, and insurers, even under Affordable Care Act rules, charge them substantially higher prices. The new plan would also simplify the current system, which requires verifying every applicant\u2019s income and then giving just the right amount of financial assistance. It would also eliminate incentives for low-income people to avoid earning more (higher earners can face a reduction in benefits).But the current system is set up to ensure that low and middle-income Americans can afford the cost of their premiums. The Republican plan would not do that, and would result in many more low-income people losing out on coverage if they couldn\u2019t find the money to pay the gap between their fixed tax credit and the cost of a health plan.Older people without employer-based insurance typically earn more than young people, who tend to be starting out in their careers. It\u2019s hard to know precisely how many people would lose coverage under this proposal because it\u2019s missing some numbers. But similar tax credit plans from House Speaker Paul Ryan and Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services, would result in millions losing coverage, according to independent estimates. (Mr. Ryan said Thursday in a news conference that the Congressional Budget Office was evaluating the new proposal, which means that we may see firm coverage estimates in the coming weeks.)A document circulated at a House Republican Caucus meeting Thursday describes a possible framework for health care reform if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.What the plan doesn\u2019t do, currently, is change any of the Obamacare regulations on health insurance that Republicans say drive up the cost. Those rules, including requirements that every plan cover a standard package of benefits, and those requiring companies to charge the same prices to healthy and sick Americans, would stay on the books, because they can\u2019t be easily changed through the budget process.Changing those rules could make insurance cheaper but would rankle many consumer advocates \u2014 and would require separate legislation, with 60 Senate votes. Under this proposal, the health plans would look largely the same, but the way the government helps people pay for them would change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Little Birdie Told Me: Playing the Market on Trump Tweets", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Analyzing Twitter for market-moving information has been a business for years. High-frequency trading firms have even built such analysis into their trading strategies.A month into Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, the best algorithmic minds on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are still scrambling to come to grips with the phenomenon.\u201cTrump\u2019s tweeting habits seem to be as erratic as everything else about him,\u201d Max Braun, an employee of the Google-affiliated research laboratory known as X, said in a recent interview.Mr. Braun has built an automated bot \u2014 Trump2Cash \u2014 that analyzes Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and then automatically places a trade on the companies the president names.But like others in his field, Mr. Braun has learned that Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior on social media does not always play out the way the science would predict.The science of trading based on Twitter predates President Trump.Yet the president \u201cis a volatility machine,\u201d said Joe Gits, the chief executive of Social Market Analytics, which produces automated analysis of social media for professional investors. \u201cHe generates more volatility than anything in the world right now, so these stocks are going to move one way or the other.\u201dMr. Gits noted that in the long run \u2014 or even within a few weeks \u2014 almost all the companies that have been hit by Mr. Trump\u2019s jabs appeared to have recovered from the damage, suggesting that investors are discounting Mr. Trump\u2019s resolve to act against the companies.But Mr. Gits said that any firm doing short-term trading had to take Mr. Trump\u2019s statements into account. It has not been easy.That complicated response is, in part, a result of the fact that professional traders are not the only ones trying to play the Trump markets \u2014 tens of thousands of armchair investors are watching the president\u2019s account and placing trades.Rachel Mayer is the co-founder of a New York start-up, Trigger Finance, that creates automatic trading triggers for small-time investors, based on real-world events. The company has created triggers for all sorts of market-moving signals \u2014 like changes in Federal Reserve policy and big stock price moves \u2014 but the triggers that Ms. Mayer\u2019s company has built around Trump\u2019s Twitter account have been by far the most popular, gaining 10,000 subscribers.Ms. Mayer, who used to be a currency trader at JPMorgan Chase, said there were a number of indications that many of her subscribers saw the tweet about Nordstrom and decided to buy the stock as a form of protest, just as many consumers said they would support the store after the president\u2019s attack.Ms. Mayer said that over time the market responses to Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamations seemed to be more restrained, which may reflect a recognition that the president\u2019s bark is worse than his bite.\u201cThe market doesn\u2019t seem to think that he\u2019s going to do anything else except complain,\u201d she said.Trump2Cash, Mr. Braun\u2019s bot, is set to hold the stock only until the end of the same trading day as the tweet. If the sentiment is negative, it places a short sale, or a bet that the price will fall, to take advantage of the stock going down.Mr. Braun has continually tweaked the rules governing Trump2Cash. He has, for instance, programmed the bot to ignore mentions of media companies, including The New York Times Company, because they amounted to more market noise than signal.But Mr. Braun says he will not mind if the bot ends up losing money \u2014 he is thinking about Trump2Cash as more of an art project than an investing strategy, and he plans to donate any money he makes from the few thousand dollars he has invested to Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, as a rebuke to Mr. Trump\u2019s politics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kraft Heinz Offers to Buy Unilever in $143 Billion Deal", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world\u2019s grocery carts could soon be filled with more and more products from one global colossus.Food, beverage and consumer-goods companies have been seeking merger partners to obtain greater scale and efficiencies as consumers, particularly younger shoppers, eschew the boxed and jarred foods of their parents\u2019 generation.Now, one such recently merged giant, Kraft Heinz, has set its sights on the biggest target to date: Unilever, the home of Dove soap and Axe body spray, Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream and Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise.Kraft Heinz disclosed on Friday that it had made a $143 billion takeover offer for Unilever. If completed, it would be the largest cross-border merger since the British wireless provider Vodafone\u2019s $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann of Germany in 2000.Unilever said it had spurned the offer, which it said \u201cfundamentally undervalues\u201d the British-Dutch company.Still, that is not expected to end the matter. Pressed by growing competition from upstarts and changing consumer habits, food and consumer-goods giants will have little choice but to seek deals.And 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that bought Heinz, then Kraft just two years ago, has the resources and the good will of Wall Street to continue to pursue Unilever. It also has the support of Warren E. Buffett, who has previously collaborated with 3G and is expected to provide financing in any deal with Unilever.A combination of Kraft Heinz and Unilever would create an empire of hundreds of household names, with more than $82 billion in sales. Kraft Heinz\u2019s geographic strength in North American packaged-food sales would complement Unilever\u2019s stronger sales in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia.Kraft Heinz executives have \u201csaid they really want to develop and have an international platform for those Kraft Heinz brands,\u201d said Brittany Weissman, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. \u201cI think Unilever would give them that international platform to get those brands out overseas.\u201dBut a merger would be certain to draw antitrust reviews by regulators from many countries.\u201cMarket power would be much increased, as the major supermarkets would have little choice but to buy from the merged business,\u201d John Colley, a professor of practice in strategy and leadership at Warwick Business School in Coventry, England.Kraft Heinz approached Unilever about a potential deal in the last few weeks, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations.Among its pitches, these people said, was that the combined company would maintain headquarters in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. That could prove important amid rising nationalist sentiment, given Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and an election approaching in the Netherlands.Shares of Mondelez, and those of companies like General Mills and Campbell Soup that had been seen as potential targets, fell on Friday in part because of disappointment over news of the Unilever bid. Shares of Kraft Heinz surged nearly 11 percent.The Brazilian principals of 3G have led a buying spree over two decades to become a global force in food and beverages. In doing so, they have won the admiration of no less a business eminence than Mr. Buffett. They took a small Brazilian brewing company and eventually transformed it into Anheuser-Busch InBev, the 800-pound gorilla of beer.They moved into fast food by buying Burger King, then merging it with Tim Hortons, Canada\u2019s foremost purveyor of coffee and doughnuts.And with Mr. Buffett\u2019s help, they bought Heinz in 2013, transforming a staid American ketchup legend into a lean maker of condiments and canned soups. Two years later, in 2015, they bought Kraft to become even bigger.Now \u2014 almost two years after the Kraft deal \u2014 3G and Kraft Heinz are casting their eyes on Unilever, which is the fourth-biggest seller of packaged food worldwide and the second-largest consumer-goods maker behind Procter & Gamble.And the company has built an important presence in developing countries, which now account for some 58 percent of its revenue.Still, Unilever has been weighed down by slowing sales in the last year, prompting some analysts to call for additional cost cuts. Combining with Kraft Heinz would leave the company in the hands of masters of cost-cutting, who have won praise from Mr. Buffett.At Kraft Heinz, that approach has helped lead to profit margins of about 30 percent, compared with roughly 15 percent at Unilever.Unilever said that Kraft Heinz\u2019s bid was valued at roughly $50 a share, for an 18 percent premium to the target company\u2019s closing price on Thursday. The offer consists of $30.23 a share in cash and 0.222 in shares in the combined company.Under British takeover rules, Kraft would have until March 17 to announce its firm intention to make an offer for Unilever or it would have to walk away.A deal for Unilever would be expensive by any measure, particularly because Kraft Heinz already has nearly $30 billion in long-term debt on its books. But Kraft Heinz has argued in private that it has healthy cash flows that could easily service the additional debt that would help finance the bid.Potentially further bolstering Kraft Heinz\u2019s firepower is Mr. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, which helped finance 3G\u2019s $23 billion purchase of Heinz and its merger with Kraft.Some analysts, however, were cautious on the prospects of a Unilever sale. Raphael Moreau, an analyst with Euromonitor in London, said that Unilever might ultimately be willing to pursue a smaller deal with Kraft to offload some of its food brands.\u201cWhile creating synergies in sauces and soups could be a rationale for such a deal, a combination of Heinz and Hellmann\u2019s in mayonnaise could struggle to be given approval by competition authorities,\u201d Mr. Moreau said.And some British lawmakers have already criticized Kraft Heinz\u2019s approach, pointing to Brexit and the decline in the pound as paving the way for \u201cfire sales\u201d of British companies.An earlier version of this article misspelled part of a name Kraft product. As the jingle goes, \u201cMy bologna has a second name, it\u2019s M-A-Y-E-R,\u201d not Meyer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bigotry and Fraud Scandal at Kindergarten Linked to Japan\u2019s First Lady", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 At Tsukamoto Kindergarten, an ultraconservative school at the center of a swirling Japanese political scandal, children receive the sort of education their prewar great-grandparents might have recognized.They march in crisp rows to military music. They recite instructions for patriotic behavior laid down by a 19th-century emperor. The intent, the school says, is to \u201cnurture patriotism and pride\u201d in the children of Japan, \u201cthe purest nation in the world.\u201dNow Tsukamoto and its traditionalist supporters \u2014 including the wife of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2014 are under fire. The school has been accused of promoting bigotry against Chinese and Koreans and of receiving illicit financial favors from the government.A growing outcry has put Mr. Abe\u2019s conservative administration on the defensive and drawn attention to the darker side of an increasingly influential right-wing education movement in Japan.Mr. Abe said on Friday in Parliament that his wife, Akie Abe, had resigned as \u201chonorary principal\u201d of a new elementary school being built by Tsukamoto\u2019s owner.The school sits on land that the owner, a private foundation, bought from the government at a steep discount \u2014 a favorable deal that invited charges of special treatment after details surfaced this month.\u201cMy wife and I are not involved at all in the school\u2019s licensing or land acquisition,\u201d Mr. Abe told the legislature. \u201cIf we were, I would resign as a politician.\u201dMr. Abe and other Japanese conservatives often accuse the education system of liberal bias, seeing it as a place where left-wing teachers spread \u201cmasochistic\u201d narratives about Japanese war guilt and promote individualism and pacifism over sturdier traditional values.Tsukamoto is at the extreme edge of an effort by rightists to push back, said Manabu Sato, a professor who studies education at Gakushuin University in Tokyo.\u201cIt\u2019s a rejection of the postwar education system, whose basic principles are pacifism and democracy,\u201d Professor Sato said.At Tsukamoto, displays of old-style patriotism have sometimes shaded into prejudice.The school apologized on its website last week for statements that contained \u201cexpressions that could invite misunderstanding from foreigners.\u201dParents said complaints about mundane-seeming matters like parent-teacher association fees would be met with chauvinistic diatribes, with school officials accusing \u201cKoreans and Chinese with evil ideas\u201d of stirring up trouble. They said the school\u2019s principal, Yasunori Kagoike, accused parents who challenged the school of having Korean or Chinese ancestors.\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Kagoike said in one notice sent to parents, was that people who had \u201cinherited the spirit\u201d of foreigners \u201cexist in our country with the looks of Japanese people.\u201dMr. Abe has made overhauling Japanese education a priority throughout his career, championing a similar if softer version of the traditionalism practiced at Tsukamoto.In early publicity pamphlets for its new elementary school obtained by the Japanese news media, Mr. Kagoike proposed naming it after Mr. Abe. Mr. Kagoike later opted for a different name, a change that the prime minister said had been made at his request.Mr. Abe has supported a drive to amend history textbooks, toning down depictions of Japan\u2019s abuses in its onetime Asian empire, and he passed legislation to make \u201cmoral education\u201d \u2014 including the promotion of patriotism \u2014 a standard part of the public school curriculum.Tsukamoto has taken the patriotic approach to schooling further.It first gained notoriety a few years ago for having pupils recite the Imperial Rescript on Education, a royal decree issued in 1890 that served as the basis for Japan\u2019s militaristic prewar school curriculum and that was repudiated after World War II.Conservatives see the rescript as a paean to traditional values; liberals as a throwback to a more authoritarian era. It encourages students to love their families, to \u201cextend benevolence to all\u201d and to \u201cpursue learning and cultivate arts\u201d \u2014 but also to be \u201cgood and faithful subjects\u201d of the emperor and to \u201coffer yourselves courageously to the state\u201d when called upon to do so.In interviews, five mothers who pulled their children out of Tsukamoto said they had encountered chauvinism at the school or had been attacked by Mr. Kagoike or his wife, who serves as vice principal, often in ethnically bigoted terms. They asked for anonymity because they feared social ostracism for speaking out.One mother said her family liked South Korea and often vacationed there, but that when her son told his teacher of a planned trip, the teacher said that Korea was a \u201cdirty place\u201d and that the family should visit \u201csomewhere better in Japan.\u201dAnother mother said teachers had told her that her son \u201csmelled like a dog,\u201d and that Mr. Kagoike had called her \u201can anti-Japanese foreigner.\u201d (She is Japanese.)Attempts to reach Mr. Kagoike failed. A woman who answered the telephone at the foundation that operates Tsukamoto, Moritomo Gakuen, said the Japanese news reports about the school and its land deal had been \u201cunfair,\u201d but she did not elaborate. Multiple follow-up calls went unanswered.In addition to serving as principal of the kindergarten, Mr. Kagoike heads Moritomo Gakuen and is a director of the Osaka branch of Nippon Kaigi, a prominent right-wing pressure group that includes Mr. Abe and other influential conservative politicians as members.In a message on Moritomo Gakuen\u2019s website, which the foundation removed on Thursday, Ms. Abe praised it for \u201cnurturing children with strong backbones, who have pride as Japanese, on a basis of superior moral education.\u201dJapan\u2019s defense minister, Tomomi Inada, has also praised the foundation, sending Mr. Kagoike a formal letter of appreciation for his work.The land deal that turned Tsukamoto from a subject of raised liberal eyebrows into a full-fledged scandal took place last year, though the details took months to emerge.The Finance Ministry allowed Moritomo Gakuen to have the land \u2014 a two-acre vacant lot near an airport in an Osaka suburb \u2014 for 134 million yen, or about $1.18 million, according to government records and testimony by ministry officials in Parliament.The price, which the ministry initially kept sealed, was surprisingly low. The ministry had previously assessed the land\u2019s value at 956 million yen, seven times higher. In comparison, a neighboring plot only slightly larger was bought by the local municipality, Toyonaka City, for 1.4 billion yen in 2010.The ministry says it lowered the price to account for cleanup costs that Moritomo Gakuen would have had to bear. It said the lot contained discarded concrete and other refuse as well as elevated levels of arsenic and lead.Opposition politicians are pressing the ministry to explain its calculations. The national daily Asahi Shimbun, which broke the story, quoted Mr. Kagoike as saying Moritomo Gakuen had spent \u201cabout 100 million yen\u201d on cleanup, a fraction of the discount it received.The new elementary school now sits partially built on the lot.Eiichi Kajita, the president of Naragakuen University who also was chairman of the licensing council that granted Moritomo Gakuen permission for the school, said the council had not been told about the land deal when it made its deliberations.He said Moritomo Gakuen\u2019s ideology, which includes an emphasis on Shintoism, Japan\u2019s ancient animist religion, was not a barrier to its opening a school, but that the council was reviewing its decision.\u201cIf there was something inappropriate, permission could be revoked,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether they\u2019re Shintoists or rightists, if parents want that, it\u2019s not our place to object.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen Schwarzman\u2019s Bad Business Advice", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFor devotees of President Trump, the first gathering on Friday of his business council, which featured 17 executives, may have looked like a colorized version of \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington,\u201d but for those focusing exclusively on the rapport between the two leaders, it resembled \u201cGoodfellas.\u201dSitting alongside Mr. Trump was the head of the council, Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, wearing Washington\u2019s newly obligatory red tie. Since its founding in 1985, Blackstone has accumulated more than $361 billion in assets and made Mr. Schwartzman a fortune estimated at $11 billion \u2014 a figure that no doubt dwarfs whatever it is that Mr. Trump is worth. In 2015, Mr. Schwarzman was paid $799 million.Mr. Schwarzman has flourished during the four decades that the people Mr. Trump purports to represent have languished. In the pursuit once known as leveraged buyouts \u2014 before some marketing genius fastened on \u201cprivate equity\u201d as a way to disguise the fact that the business still rests on a mountain of debt \u2014 Mr. Schwarzman and his brethren have become symbols for the economic inequality that Mr. Trump deplored during his campaign. They are able to borrow billions and deduct interest payments from their corporate tax bills while $75,000-a-year wage earners in Ohio, Michigan or Pennsylvania are unable to secure a mortgage and get no tax break on their monthly rent.Just like Mr. Trump\u2019s real-estate business, groups like Blackstone rely on enormous debt to prop up their business. The playbook for any of their acquisitions is to gain 100 percent control by financing the purchase of a company with a small down payment and a heap of debt secured not (heaven forbid) by their own savings or houses, but by the business they are looking to acquire. They then cut costs \u2014 which almost always means making sizable layoffs at the company they\u2019re taking over \u2014 and figure out a way to reward themselves financially.It\u2019s the equivalent of making a small down payment on your neighbors\u2019 house; paying for the balance by taking out a mortgage secured by their savings, jewelry, silverware and car; selling off the contents of their property; and then siphoning off some of the loan for yourself.Perhaps, after Friday\u2019s meeting, traveling together aboard Air Force One to Mr. Trump\u2019s club in Florida, Mr. Schwarzman explained to Mr. Trump that he could make America great again by employing the same tactics Blackstone used after its $4.1 billion acquisition in 2006 of Travelport, a travel-reservations business that within a year of the purchase had laid off 841 workers, or 10 percent of its work force.The story of this fiasco is enough to make anyone weep: Laid-off workers were forced to sell their homes; others lost their health insurance and postponed plans to start a family; some were stuck on unemployment lines. Even more brazenly, Blackstone, seven months after its investment, layered more debt on Travelport, which it used to pay itself back for the original purchase. Travelport subsequently underwent two restructurings of its debt.Firms like Blackstone will, with a straight face, argue that they are making American companies more efficient and that we are all better off as a result. Were that it were so. They do not advertise the fact that their principals benefit from an indefensible quirk in the United States tax code that allows them to pay lower taxes on their capital gains. (I also benefit from this quirk, albeit in a very different capacity, as an investor in Silicon Valley. I should stress that the opinions expressed in this piece don\u2019t necessarily reflect those of Sequoia Capital.)In 2010 Mr. Schwarzman denounced an attempt to remove this loophole as comparable to Hitler\u2019s invasion of Poland, a remark for which he later apologized. You will also not find any mention on Blackstone\u2019s website that for the past 14 years all of its buyout funds \u2014 which together generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year for Mr. Schwarzman and his partners \u2014 have ranked among the top 25 percent of such funds.This then was the backdrop for the agenda for the inaugural meeting of Mr. Trump\u2019s business council. Little wonder that the agenda appeared to center on deregulation, the loosening of restrictions of the financial industry and stepped-up protectionism. No surprise either that missing from the menu was the abolition of the carried-interest loophole (a loophole Mr. Trump vowed to close during his campaign) and the deductibility of interest payments. It is wishful thinking that this group will ever contemplate anything so daring as to make private equity principals personally liable for the loans they assign to companies \u2014 a move that, with the stroke of a pen, would curb many abuses and protect American workers and others whose standard of living has barely budged in a couple of decades.The lower- and middle-income Americans who voted for Mr. Trump in droves would do well to listen hard to what Mr. Schwarzman is advising. They\u2019ll hear the sound of dollars being sucked out of their pockets and slipped into the wallets of the 1 percent.Michael Moritz is a partner of Sequoia Capital.Advertisement"}

Several activists said that they did not know how the campaign began or how many people would heed it, and that as far as they knew, there was no national organization behind it.His daughter, Laela Shallal, who manages finance and marketing for the company, said employees could choose between using some of their paid leave on Thursday, or going to work to clean or organize the restaurants and offices.\u201cWe think that this is really something that a lot of our staff feels really passionate about,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking their side, so that they feel the company they work for is living up to their values.\u201dAmaya Sales, a kitchen manager at the Busboys and Poets restaurant in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington, said workers first approached management early this week about taking part. \u201cIt\u2019s just to, like, show most of America how much important we are to do the hard work in the United States,\u201d Mr. Sales said.In a city with more than 2,000 restaurants, the day of closures and absences may not be enough to prevent anyone from getting a table. But given the upscale, popular businesses involved, it will be noticed.An immigrant advocacy group, Cosecha (the Spanish word for harvest), has been planning a day without immigrants on May 1. Maria Fernanda Cabello, a Cosecha organizer, said it was not behind Thursday\u2019s campaign, but viewed it as something of a dry run, and was working with some local groups that were promoting it.\u201cWe don\u2019t know where this started, and as far as we know, there isn\u2019t anyone putting it all together,\u201d Ms. Cabello said. \u201cWe started seeing messages about it in different cities a few weeks ago, and it\u2019s really picked up in the last couple of days.\u201dOwners of some smaller businesses said that they supported the idea but that the campaign was too hastily organized to justify closing. Josh Phillips, a co-owner of Espita Mezcaleria in Washington, said that rather than close, he wanted to donate a portion of his restaurant\u2019s proceeds on Thursday to the organizers of the campaign. But, he said, \u201cwe still don\u2019t know who\u2019s organizing it.\u201dEach dinner receipt, Mr. Phillips said, will be inscribed with the phrase, \u201cThis meal was made possible by immigrants.\u201dIvan Iricanin, who owns Ambar, a Balkan restaurant with locations in Washington and Arlington, Va., said that after meeting with his staff on Monday, he decided to keep the restaurants open. But, he said, about seven of his 100 employees chose not to work on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a lot of questions that were unanswered,\u201d Mr. Iricanin, 39, said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I think that some people are all for it and some are in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump and Lawmakers Confer on Imports and Tax Code", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, at loggerheads with congressional Republicans over the best way to overhaul the tax code, may have come toward Capitol Hill on a key sticking point, the way imports should be taxed, after a meeting at the White House on Thursday, said Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.Congressional Republicans are trying to nudge Mr. Trump away from one of his big campaign promises: a 35 percent tariff on any product made by an American company at an overseas factory, then imported into the United States market. Success in getting the president off that applause line will be critical to getting tax legislation passed in 2017 and fulfilling a central promise that Republicans have been making to voters for years.At the White House meeting, Mr. Brady was joined by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat, and Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means. The conversation with Mr. Trump also focused on trade and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mr. Brady\u2019s plan would also essentially levy a 20 percent tax on all imports, to create revenue and spur domestic production and exports \u2014 a notion Mr. Trump has said is overly complicated. The prospect of such a sweeping change has stirred fears among big companies in the retail and energy sectors, which rely heavily on imports, and created a backlash that could scuttle plans to slash tax rates without adding to the deficit.The split within corporate America over the shape of a tax code rewrite was on display Thursday as Freedom Partners, an advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, called on Republicans to \u201cscrap\u201d the border tax idea, which it warned would mean higher prices for consumers. Also Thursday, a new business group, the American Made Coalition, began to rally support around the tax plan championed by Mr. Brady and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.Mr. Brady said he was confident that the White House and worried companies were starting to come around. \u201cThe more people learn about why we need to tax equally within the U.S., at this new low business rate of 20 percent, they come on board in gangbusters,\u201d he said in an interview.Mr. Brady is still engaged in negotiations and salesmanship. He said on Thursday that although there should be no exemptions for importers of any kind, Republicans were open to working with businesses that rely heavily on imports to develop ways to ease new tax burdens. He also said the United States did not intend to flout the rules of the World Trade Organization.House Republicans will also need to hash out their final tax plan with Republicans in the Senate, and rumblings this week from Mr. Hatch suggested that they might not be on the same page. Speaking at the Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, Mr. Hatch said he had concerns about the border tax and that the Senate\u2019s legislation would almost certainly end up looking different from what the House produces.Mr. Trump and his staff have continued to publicly float provocative ideas, such as taxing companies that move their manufacturing operations abroad and sell products in the United States, and taxing products from Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall along the border. \u201cThe president is clearly laying out a bunch of different options that he could use, including those tariffs,\u201d Mr. Brady said, suggesting that his plan would be more \u201cpro-growth.\u201dAs for using revenues from the tax overhaul to pay for the wall, Mr. Brady insisted that such projects are not his focus. \u201cOur focus right now is all on growth within tax reform,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cDiscussions on how new revenues are spent I\u2019m sure will be part of future discussions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Fund Health Plan, G.O.P. Considers Limiting Popular Tax Break", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthIn order to fund health insurance for Americans who don\u2019t get coverage through work, congressional Republicans are considering changing the system for those who do.This week, health care committees in the House and Senate circulated an outline of an Affordable Care Act repeal and replacement plan. That outline explained how money would be spent on the program \u2014 on Medicaid, tax benefits for holders of health savings accounts, and tax credits for individuals buying their own insurance. What it did not say was how government would pay for the plan. Moreover, it called for eliminating taxes imposed by the A.C.A., including taxes on medical devices, drugs and health insurance plans.But congressional Republicans do have an idea about where they could find some money to pay for their health program: by limiting the size of the tax break employers and workers receive on their health plans. Several lawmakers who attended a House Republican caucus meeting Thursday said such a plan was under discussion.For workers and employers, it feels like a great deal: Depending on how much you pay in taxes, the savings on the cost of expensive health benefits can be substantial. And most Americans under 65 benefit from tax savings associated with this policy.But the economists dislike it anyway, for two main reasons: 1) They argue that it distorts the market for health insurance by creating incentives to spend more money on benefits than salaries. Those richer plans, they argue, lead workers to use too much health care and to remain insensitive to the cost of services, driving up health costs. 2) Liberal economists believe the tax exclusion is regressive, benefiting richer workers more than poorer ones, who would pay comparatively lower tax rates on ordinary income.Experts on the left also dislike the exclusion. That\u2019s why a tax on high-cost health plans, nicknamed the Cadillac tax, was part of the original Affordable Care Act law.\u201cIt\u2019s turned out to be very hard to say to people: \u2018Your health costs are too high. To address this, we think you should pay more for health insurance,\u2019 \u201d David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard who dislikes the deduction and advised the Obama administration on health policy, wrote in an email. \u201cNot sure why, but it\u2019s not totally effective.\u201dWorkers might end up with less generous health plans, but they\u2019d be paying proportionately less in overall taxes. And, the theory goes, if wages and health benefits are taxed at the same rate, employers might be more inclined to give their workers a raise instead of another health benefit.But none of the possible benefits of the policy change are likely to make it popular. The Affordable Care Act generally provides benefits for a small fraction of the American population, as would a Republican replacement plan. The number that benefit from the employer system is much, much larger.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House G.O.P. Leaders Outline Plan to Replace Obama Health Care Act", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders on Thursday presented their rank-and-file members with the outlines of their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, leaning heavily on tax credits to finance individual insurance purchases and sharply reducing federal payments to the 31 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility.Speaker Paul D. Ryan and two House committee chairmen stood with the new secretary of health and human services, former Representative Tom Price of Georgia, preparing Republican lawmakers for a weeklong Presidents\u2019 Day recess that promises to be dominated by angry or anxious questions about the fate of the health law.But the talking points they provided did not say how the legislation would be paid for, essentially laying out the benefits without the more controversial costs.It also included no estimates of the number of people who would gain or lose insurance under the plan, nor did it include comparisons with the Affordable Care Act, which has extended coverage to 20 million people.With the House proposal\u2019s rollback of Medicaid payments to the states, it appears likely that the number covered would be smaller.House Republican leaders asserted in a document describing their plan that they would not \u201cpull the rug out from anyone who received care under states\u2019 Medicaid expansions.\u201dBut Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, expressed alarm, saying the proposals would \u201cput a huge amount of pressure on state budgets and put many Americans at risk of losing health care coverage.\u201dIt would fundamentally remake Medicaid, a Great Society program that provides health care to more than 70 million Americans, not just the poor, but also middle-class people who have run out of money and need nursing home care. Under the plan, Medicaid, an open-ended entitlement program designed to cover all health care needs, would be put on a budget.The Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies, which expand as incomes decline, giving the poorer people more help, would be replaced by fixed tax credits to help people purchase insurance policies. The tax credits would increase with a person\u2019s age, but would not vary with a person\u2019s income.A document circulated at a House Republican Caucus meeting Thursday describes a possible framework for health care reform if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.And new incentives for consumers to establish savings accounts to pay medical expenses still assume that workers would have money at the end of a pay period to sock away.The House Republican plan would also make it easier for consumers to buy health insurance from companies licensed in other states, an idea long promoted by Republicans in Congress and championed by President Trump in his campaign last year.After the recess, Mr. Ryan said: \u201cWe intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. It has become increasingly clear that this law is collapsing. People\u2019s premiums are getting higher and higher. Their deductibles are soaring, and their choices are dwindling.\u201dMr. Price told House Republicans that Mr. Trump \u201cis all in on this.\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s presentation on Thursday was meant to generate a sense of momentum for the Republicans\u2019 campaign to eviscerate President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 a campaign that has been plagued by apprehensions, doubts and divisions among Republicans in the last few weeks.It was not clear whether the plan as outlined would get Republicans much closer to resolution. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee, said that he and other Senate committee chairmen were working with their House counterparts, with the goal of developing a \u201cconsensus document.\u201d The House, he said, will probably act first but \u201cwill have the input of senators and the president.\u201dHouse conservatives are saying that any plan must begin with a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement that looks nothing like it. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, said Republicans needed to talk about replacement measures \u201cin specific terms, not in aspirational terms.\u201d\u201cWe believe that it\u2019s time that we make some very difficult decisions and move forward,\u201d Mr. Meadows said.Any plan that can satisfy House conservatives would face great uncertainty in the more moderate Senate.The plan unveiled on Thursday by House Republican leaders would make huge changes in Medicaid. It would eventually undo the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and give each state a fixed amount of money for each beneficiary. As an alternative, they said, a state could receive a lump sum of federal money for all of its Medicaid program, or a block grant.In either case, the federal government would gradually reduce the extra payments it makes to states that have expanded Medicaid under the 2010 health care law. States could continue providing Medicaid to the newly eligible beneficiaries, but the federal share of the costs would decline to the regular federal share of Medicaid costs for other beneficiaries.The federal government now pays more than 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries in states that expanded Medicaid. Under the House Republican plan, the federal share would decline to 50 percent in states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, resulting in a significant loss of federal revenue.In a number of states that have expanded Medicaid, Republican governors and Republican members of Congress have made clear that they do not like the idea of a block grant or a per-beneficiary allotment.The Congressional Budget Office says that 12 million people have insurance because they became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and it estimates that federal spending for this group will be $70 billion this year.The House Republican plan would immediately eliminate tax penalties for people who do not have insurance and employers that do not offer it.It would also eliminate taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the 2010 health care law. These include fees collected from health insurance companies and manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and an excise tax on makers of medical devices.House Republicans have repeatedly said that they would continue providing some protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions. But the document describing their proposal does not say how they would do that.Mr. Ryan said the tax credits envisioned by House Republicans were different from those provided in the Affordable Care Act.Under that law, the tax credits are available only for insurance products that meet detailed federal standards and are purchased through an insurance exchange like HealthCare.gov.By contrast, Mr. Ryan said, with the Republican version of tax credits, people can \u201cbuy the health insurance plan of their choosing,\u201d which could cost less and have less generous coverage than the plans now available.\u201cYou get the freedom to do what you want and buy what you need,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.During a transition period, House Republicans would continue \u201cObamacare subsidies,\u201d but they would provide a little more assistance to young people and a little less to older Americans.The House Republican plan would provide an unspecified amount of money for \u201cinnovation grants,\u201d which states could use to help defray consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs or to establish \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d for people with serious chronic conditions.Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Norton Rose and Chadbourne to Combine in Latest Merger of Large Law Firms", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo large law firms said on Tuesday that they would combine to form a global firm amid continuing consolidation in the legal industry.The two firms, Norton Rose Fulbright and Chadbourne & Parke, will merge into a single entity with more than 4,000 lawyers and expected annual revenue just under $2 billion. The combined firm will be known as Norton Rose Fulbright.The merger, which is to take effect in the year\u2019s second quarter, is the second large-scale combination for Norton Rose, whose biggest previous merger partner was the Texas firm Fulbright & Jaworski in 2013.The combination with Chadbourne will give the new firm about 1,000 lawyers in the United States, including more than 300 in New York and around 130 in Washington.Norton Rose Fulbright posted global revenue of $1.74 billion in 2015, the latest year for which figures were available; Chadbourne had $249 million in revenue the same year.Rumors had swirled recently that Chadbourne was looking for a combination, especially after some partners left the firm, including corporate and project finance partner Margarita Oliva Sainz de Aja, who joined Baker McKenzie last month, and bankruptcy partner Douglas Deutsch, who joined Clifford Chance last summer.Chadbourne received some negative publicity last fall when a female partner, Kerrie L. Campbell, sued the firm for $100 million on behalf of current and former female partners.In her lawsuit, which is pending, Ms. Campbell accused the firm of routinely paying female partners less than men and of keeping women out of leadership positions. In 2015, Chadbourne\u2019s profits per partner were slightly more than $1.1 million, according to The American Lawyer, a legal trade publication.The combination of the two firms continues a trend in the legal industry. There have been more than 80 mergers and acquisitions involving law firms in each of the past four years. There were 85 such deals in 2016, according to the Altman Weil MergerLine, which tracks such deals. With demand for legal services sluggish, more consolidation is predicted in the industry.Even before its deal with Chadbourne, Norton Rose had been growing quickly through a string of international combinations \u2014 including one last year with Bull Housser, a 92-lawyer firm in Vancouver, British Columbia.Leaders of Norton Rose and Chadbourne said in a statement that the merger would enhance the strengths of the two firms.\u201cOur global offerings will be virtually unrivaled in many areas, from energy and infrastructure to finance, bankruptcy and restructuring, litigation and regulatory work,\u201d said Andrew A. Giaccia, Chadbourne\u2019s managing partner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Ignored Trump News for a Week. Here\u2019s What I Learned.", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didn\u2019t read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president.It wasn\u2019t my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours), but shifted most of my energy to looking for Trump-free zones.My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no Trump-free part of the press.But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosystem. Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever. The reasons have as much to do with him as the way social media amplifies every big story until it swallows the world. And as important as covering the president may be, I began to wonder if we were overdosing on Trump news, to the exclusion of everything else.The new president doesn\u2019t simply dominate national and political news. During my week of attempted Trump abstinence, I noticed something deeper: He has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind, political or not. He is no longer just the message. In many cases, he has become the medium, the ether through which all other stories flow.Obviously, just about every corner of the news was a minefield, but it was my intention to keep informed while avoiding Mr. Trump. I still consulted major news sites, but avoided sections that tend to be Trump-soaked, and averted my eyes as I scrolled for non-Trump news. I spent more time on international news sites like the BBC, and searched for subject-specific sites covering topics like science and finance. I consulted social news sites like Digg and Reddit, and occasionally checked Twitter and Facebook, but I often had to furiously scroll past all of the Trump posts. (Some news was unavoidable; when Mr. Flynn resigned, a journalist friend texted me about it.)Even when I found non-Trump news, though, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a fruit-and-nut cake without getting any fruit or nuts.Where else could I go? Snapchat and Instagram were relatively safe, but the president still popped up. Even Amazon.com suggested I consider Trump toilet paper for my wife\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day present. (I bought her jewelry.)All presidents are omnipresent. But it is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now. It\u2019s possible that not even the most famous or infamous people of the recent or distant past \u2014 say, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali or Adolf Hitler \u2014 dominated media as thoroughly at their peak as Mr. Trump does now.I\u2019m hedging because there isn\u2019t data to directly verify this declaration. (Of course, there are no media analytics to measure how many outlets were covering Hitler the day he invaded Poland.) But there is some pretty good circumstantial evidence.Consider data from mediaQuant, a firm that measures \u201cearned media,\u201d which is all coverage that isn\u2019t paid advertising. To calculate a dollar value of earned media, it first counts every mention of a particular brand or personality in just about any outlet, from blogs to Twitter to the evening news to The New York Times. Then it estimates how much the mentions would cost if someone were to pay for them as advertising.In January, Mr. Trump broke mediaQuant\u2019s records. In a single month, he received $817 million in coverage, higher than any single person has ever received in the four years that mediaQuant has been analyzing the media, according to Paul Senatori, the company\u2019s chief analytics officer. For much of the past four years, Mr. Obama\u2019s monthly earned media value hovered around $200 million to $500 million. The highest that Hillary Clinton got during the presidential campaign was $430 million, in July.It\u2019s not just that Mr. Trump\u2019s coverage beats anyone else\u2019s. He is now beating pretty much everyone else put together. Mr. Senatori recently added up the coverage value of 1,000 of the world\u2019s best known figures, excluding Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. The list includes Mrs. Clinton, who in January got $200 million in coverage, Tom Brady ($38 million), Kim Kardashian ($36 million), and Vladimir V. Putin ($30 million), all the way down to the 1,000th most-mentioned celebrity in mediaQuant\u2019s database, the actress Madeleine Stowe ($1,001).The coverage those 1,000 people garnered last month totaled $721 million. In other words, Mr. Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1,000 famous people put together. And he is on track to match or beat his January record in February, according to Mr. Senatori\u2019s preliminary figures.\u201cFrom a media perspective, it\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d Mr. Senatori said. \u201cThe sheer volume, and the sheer amount of consumption, and all the new channels that are available today show that, yeah, he\u2019s off the charts.\u201dMr. Trump is a historically unusual president, and thus deserves plenty of coverage. Yet there\u2019s an argument that our tech-fueled modern media ecosystem is amplifying his presence even beyond what\u2019s called for.There\u2019s a reason you aren\u2019t seeing these stories splashed across the news. Unlike old-school media, today\u2019s media works according to social feedback loops. Every story that shows any signs of life on Facebook or Twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet, becoming unavoidable.Mr. Watts and his colleagues found that adding social signals changed the music people were interested in. Inequality went up: When people could see what others were downloading, popular songs became far more popular, and unpopular songs far less popular. Social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes; when people could see how others had picked songs, the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success, and bad songs were more likely to become popular.I suspect we are seeing something like this effect playing out with Trump news. It\u2019s not that coverage of the new administration is unimportant. It clearly is. But social signals \u2014 likes, retweets and more \u2014 are amplifying it.It\u2019s only been a month since Mr. Trump took office, and already the deluge of news has been overwhelming. Everyone \u2014 reporters, producers, anchors, protesters, people in the administration and consumers of news \u2014 has been amped up to 11.For now, this might be all right. It\u2019s important to pay attention to the federal government when big things are happening.But Mr. Trump is likely to be president for at least the next four years. And it\u2019s probably not a good idea for just about all of our news to be focused on a single subject for that long.In previous media eras, the news was able to find a sensible balance even when huge events were preoccupying the world. Newspapers from World War I and II were filled with stories far afield from the war. Today\u2019s newspapers are also full of non-Trump articles, but many of us aren\u2019t reading newspapers anymore. We\u2019re reading Facebook and watching cable, and there, Mr. Trump is all anyone talks about, to the exclusion of almost all else.There\u2019s no easy way out of this fix. But as big as Mr. Trump is, he\u2019s not everything \u2014 and it\u2019d be nice to find a way for the media ecosystem to recognize that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushner Family Is in Talks to Buy Miami Marlins", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sale of a major league sports team always draws attention and local interest. But this one may attract even more interest, especially around the White House.The Kushners, the New York real estate family whose scion is a close adviser to President Trump, are in negotiations to buy the Miami Marlins baseball team, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.The Kushners \u2014 led by Joshua Kushner, a venture capitalist, and Joseph Meyer, his brother-in-law and key lieutenant for the family\u2019s investments \u2014 have pursued the Marlins for several months, devising a complicated financial arrangement that would include bringing in partners later, these people said. Mr. Kushner is the younger brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law.Any deal would have to win the approval of Major League Baseball, which would closely scrutinize the buyer\u2019s financing and would probably seek to ensure that Charles Kushner had no role in operations.The deal has already prompted questions within Major League Baseball, according to the people briefed on the conversations, about what kind of relationship Mr. Trump would have to the team and whether that would be a benefit or a disadvantage. Would fans or sponsors boycott or embrace the team or league based on a comment or Twitter post by Mr. Trump? And would Mr. Trump attend games?As part of the financing for the Kushners\u2019 bid, which was being shepherded by the boutique investment bank LionTree, the family would plan to bring in additional partners to help defray the costs.Representatives for the Kushners, the Marlins and LionTree declined to comment.Some of the people with knowledge of the Kushners\u2019 bid said that Joshua Kushner, drawing upon his experience investing in technology companies like Instagram, saw potential profits in capitalizing on the Marlins\u2019 digital rights.The Marlins are currently owned by Jeffrey Loria, who paid $158 million for the team in 2002 after selling the Montreal Expos back to Major League Baseball. The team won the World Series in 2003 \u2014 when they defeated the Yankees \u2014 but has not returned to the playoffs since.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Throwing Away a Legal Career for $310,000", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchWould you sell your career for $310,000? It appears that Jeffrey A. Wertkin may have tried to do just that by passing a copy of a sealed whistle-blower complaint against a Silicon Valley company to one of its employees in exchange for that amount.Unfortunately, he never actually got the money because he was met instead by an F.B.I. agent, who arrested him. Mr. Wertkin responded \u201cMy life is over,\u201d according to a complaint filed in the Federal District Court in San Francisco.Mr. Wertkin has not yet entered a plea.But Mr. Wertkin, as the government\u2019s criminal complaint describes, went to great lengths to devise an exchange that could be straight out of a spy novel, involving a code name, a secret rendezvous, text messages and a disguise. Even though it appears Mr. Wertkin has never run afoul of the law before, and his record as a lawyer shows no disciplinary actions, he would not meet the other requirements for a reduced sentence because the conduct involved a detailed plan that played out over about two months. He took many steps to cover up his identity and, perhaps worse, he may have obtained the sealed complaint before joining Akin Gump in April 2016, which would show this was an elaborate process rather than a one-time event.Mr. Wertkin\u2019s background and otherwise exemplary work record would still be important in a potential sentencing. The focus would shift to the motivation for the crime to explain why he engaged in this type of conduct despite an otherwise successful career.There is no word yet about Mr. Wertkin\u2019s motivation for undertaking a course of action that now looks almost laughably amateurish, but the silliness may indicate that it was the product of desperation and not a more nefarious plan. It would not be a surprise to hear that there were financial or familial pressures, or perhaps some combination of them, at the root of a decision to put an entire career at risk for an amount that was probably less than his annual pay at the law firm.Mr. Caspersen was a successful Wall Street investment banker who defrauded family and friends out of more than $38 million to finance a speculative trading binge. At the sentencing hearing, his lawyer offered evidence that the conduct was the product of a gambling addiction that drove him to keep betting on the market until he went broke.For a defendant like Mr. Wertkin, the criminal prosecution is just the first step in a process that will affect him for the rest of his life if he is convicted. As a lawyer, a conviction for this type of conduct is likely to be considered a crime of \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d because it involves a significant breach of the duty of a lawyer to maintain the confidentiality of a client\u2019s information.The collateral consequences of a conviction can mean not being able to do some things we often take for granted. The rules vary by state, but a person convicted of a felony can lose the right to vote, own a gun, serve on a jury or enter other professions that require the applicant to prove good moral character.On a more personal level, a conviction probably means that it will be much more difficult to get a job because some employers shy away from hiring a person who has been convicted of a crime. Even something like volunteering to coach a Little League or soccer team for one\u2019s children may not be possible if it requires a criminal background check, which may cause the organization to decline an offer to help.So the answer to the question whether it was worth it for Mr. Wertkin is simple in hindsight. But I suspect that it seemed like a good idea at the time.Advertisement"}
