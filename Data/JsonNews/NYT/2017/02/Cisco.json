{"Headline": "Activism Hits Even the Less Flashy Tech Companies", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As soon as President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, some of the biggest tech companies went quiet. Their executives did not sign legal briefs, brandish statements or dissent on Twitter. They strove for business as usual.This was the older, stodgier, less glamorous part of the tech universe. These executives are generally not household names. Most of the companies have little presence in the excitable consumer marketplace. Some are government contractors. Their workers tend to be more settled, less tempted by cool start-ups. Despite the companies\u2019 sizable employment, the spotlight is not on them.Among these firms are IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Qualcomm, Cisco, Dell and Oracle. When 127 companies signed an amicus brief last week in a Seattle court that said the executive order \u201cviolates the immigration laws and the Constitution,\u201d none of these six firms were on the list.Yet even at some of these companies, there are stirrings of defiance. In a few well-publicized cases, workers have noisily quit. Many more have chosen to remain but are agitating for an explicit corporate morality even as Mr. Trump considers a new executive order on immigration. They want their companies to make clear not only what they support but also, perhaps even more important, what lines they will not cross.The activist push is being driven in significant measure by women, who are still fighting for their due in a male-dominated industry. But in an unlikely twist, the chief executives they are trying to influence at two major companies are female.\u201cIn some instances it is notable for a company to take a stand on an issue,\u201d said one of the women, Irene Scher, a regional vice president of sales. \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s notable not to have taken a stand.\u201dA co-chief executive of Oracle, Safra Catz, and the chief executive of IBM, Virginia Rometty, became advisers to Mr. Trump during the transition. \u201cI know that you are committed to help America\u2019s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people,\u201d Ms. Rometty wrote to him in November. Ms. Catz said in December, \u201cWe are with him and will help in any way we can.\u201dThe three friends who created the Oracle petition joined the company in August, when it acquired the company they worked for, Opower. They emphasize they are not at odds with their employer.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a criticism of Oracle,\u201d said one of them, Rachel Kane, a sales executive at Oracle Utilities. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them visibility into how individuals at the company feel.\u201d Oracle declined to comment.Cauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM, said she believed \u201cworkplaces have a responsibility to society \u2014 to the clients we serve, the employees we hire and the citizens who are impacted by our decisions.\u201d She said IBM had been \u201cprogressive\u201d in encouraging women\u2019s participation in technology and on other issues, but had not delivered on the immigration ban.\u201cIBM\u2019s decision not to actively stand up to the Trump administration and condemn this policy is extremely disturbing,\u201d she said.Dell and Cisco declined to comment. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.The internal debate at some of the big tech companies revolves around the question of engagement: Can you persuade more from the inside than the outside?The pro-engagement position has been expressed by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and a member of the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum. In a handful of cases, people have said they are canceling new Teslas because they view him as working for the president.Mr. Musk said he had made sure that the travel ban was discussed \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d at a Feb. 3 White House meeting. A spokeswoman said no further details were available.The answer did not satisfy everyone. As one critic replied to Mr. Musk on Twitter: \u201cYou are not advising Trump, you are giving him cover and validating his nonsense. You can do more good by taking a stand. Please.\u201dIBM released a statement that said Ms. Rometty had \u201cconveyed the company\u2019s views directly to the president and the secretary of Homeland Security\u201d on Feb. 3, \u201cincluding suggestions for how technology can help to promote both national security and lawful immigration.\u201dEd Barbini, vice president for corporate communications at IBM, said no further details were available. He noted that the company said in December that it would never participate in the building of a Muslim registry. He declined to comment on the petition.When a small group of IBM employees was drawing up the petition in November, it debated including a reference to the Nazis. IBM maintains that the accounts of its role in Hitler\u2019s regime are overblown and incendiary.\u201cWatson sacrificed short-term business interests in order to be on the right side of history, something IBM takes pride in today,\u201d the petition says.Daniel Hanley, one of the organizers, said the goal was \u201cto build an organization inside the company that can hold IBM accountable to our values, and serve as a model for tech workers at other companies.\u201d\u201cWhen his policies border on the unconstitutional, the criminal and the morally unjust,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI am here to oppose him in every possible and legal way.\u201dThat was on a Monday. Mr. Polisner told his boss that he would work through Friday. After the letter became public, Mr. Polisner was fired immediately. At 56, he said, he probably would have worked at Oracle for a few more years if politics had not intervened.\u201cThere are different ways to influence,\u201d Mr. Polisner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal decision. I chose this one.\u201dMs. Scher at Oracle and her friends chose another.\u201cWe all participated in the Women\u2019s March,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible we\u2019re feeling a heightened sense of civic responsibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shopping for Love Seats", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShopping GuideBecause a love seat is intended for only two people, it might seem like the ideal piece of furniture to curl up on for Valentine\u2019s Day. But for city dwellers trying to make the most of small-scale rooms, love seats are appealing year-round, and may even take the place of larger sofas.Perhaps that\u2019s why furniture makers and retailers have so many other names for them: apartment sofas, two-seaters, settees.No matter what the seats are called, Kati Curtis, an interior designer in New York, has a rule of thumb for distinguishing a (two-person) love seat from a (three-person) sofa: \u201cAnything under 72 inches long.\u201dLength isn\u2019t the only consideration, though. \u201cOne of the big things I look at is the arm thickness, because that\u2019s going to increase or decrease the overall seating area,\u201d Ms. Curtis said. \u201cEspecially here in the city, I always look for thin arms to get more seating space out of it.\u201d\u2022 What kind of legs are best? \u201cIf the room is small, and you want the love seat to appear light, I\u2019d do longer legs,\u201d Ms. Curtis said. But to make it feel grounded in a larger space, shorter legs or a skirt would be better.\u2022 How tall should the back be? If the love seat will be sitting in the middle of a room, a lower back allows for better sightlines, Ms. Curtis said. But if it will be pushed against a wall, a taller back creates a cocooning feel.\u2022 \u201cConsider how many people might actually sit on it,\u201d Ms. Curtis advised. If the love seat will be used most often by one person at a time, a single seat cushion is better than two separate on____________________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Picking a New Phone Plan? Here Are Your Best Bets", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixShopping for a phone plan can be as daunting as picking a health insurance package. The rates and options constantly change, and it feels impossible to make simple comparisons between carriers.But now T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&T and, most recently, Verizon Wireless have resurrected unlimited data. As enticing as that may sound, unlimited is ideal for a small set of people. For everyone else, you may be paying for more than you need, and the plans come with major limitations on how you can use them.Still, it is a good time to consider a new phone plan. Phone manufacturers like Samsung Electronics, LG and Sony are expected to show new smartphones next week at Mobile World Congress, the annual trade show centered on mobile devices.The Wirecutter\u2019s pick comes down to a simple fact: A smartphone is no good if it lacks a connection, so good coverage should be the top consideration when you select a plan.But choosing the best plan for you is not as simple as heading straight for a Verizon plan, Mr. Toikka said. Prices can fluctuate, and in some cases, AT&T, the second-largest carrier, offers a better deal on a network that is generally as good as Verizon\u2019s. Here are recommendations we made with the help of Mr. Toikka for the best phone plans for individuals, couples, families and travelers.AT&T\u2019S THREE-GIGABYTE PLANVERIZON\u2019S UNLIMITED DATA PLANOnly Verizon\u2019s unlimited data plan includes the ability to tether, or share a smartphone\u2019s cellular data with another device like a computer. Both plans share a limitation: After 22 gigabytes of use in a month, data speeds may be slowed.AT&T\u2019S SHARED SIX-GIGABYTE PLANVERIZON\u2019S OR AT&T\u2019S UNLIMITED DATA PLANVERIZON\u2019S UNLIMITED DATA PLANVERIZON\u2019S AND AT&T\u2019S TRAVEL PLANS OR A FOREIGN SIM CARDKelly Crummey, a Verizon spokeswoman, said, \u201cVerizon\u2019s coverage is second to none, and we have very competitively priced plans loaded with features, providing customers with incredible value.\u201dAT&T said it \u201cprovides value to customers that our competitors can\u2019t match.\u201dSwitching to a new phone plan can be tedious and frustrating, and chances are you are happy with the one you have. But Mr. Pegoraro of The Wirecutter warned that sticking with a dated plan could make you miss out on options that offer better value or neat features like tethering.\u201cDon\u2019t assume that the plan you\u2019ve been on is the one you should stay on,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this column misstated which data plans had a feature. Only the Verizon unlimited plan has the ability to tether; it is not the case that both AT&T and Verizon have that distinction.Advertisement"}
