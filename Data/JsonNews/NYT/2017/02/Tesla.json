{"Headline": "German Automakers Step Up to Silicon Valley Challenge", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWOLFSBURG, Germany \u2014 One of the first things Ole Harms did after taking over Volkswagen\u2019s new ride-hailing start-up was leave town.Staid Wolfsburg, Volkswagen\u2019s home, was not the best place for the automaker to mount a defense against Silicon Valley challengers keen to upend the car industry, and he needed to move.\u201cNobody knows how the world is going to look\u201d in the coming years, said Mr. Harms, a bearded 41-year-old dressed in a gray cardigan over a crisply pressed white shirt. \u201cThe biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change.\u201dAt stake is the fate of the German economy, Europe\u2019s largest, at a time when the region is only beginning to emerge from a decade-long economic malaise. Germany, in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.Industry executives here often cite how Apple\u2019s iPhone quickly erased Nokia\u2019s once-dominant position in the mobile handset market, and they are determined not to let something similar happen to them.\u201cI am convinced that we are going to see more change in the next 10 or 15 years than we have seen in the last 100 years,\u201d Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the BMW management board, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe big question is always, Do we car manufacturers learn to become tech companies more quickly than a tech company learns to be an automotive player?\u201dBy contrast, Germany\u2019s automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach.To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon fiber body.Daimler also owns Car2Go, a short-term car rental service; Blacklane, an upmarket ride-hailing app; and MyTaxi, Europe\u2019s largest taxi-hailing service.Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, said the automaker\u2019s backing had allowed it to expand rapidly across Europe, where it has often teamed up with local taxi associations to combat the rise of Uber.\u201cThis is a game that requires deep pockets,\u201d Mr. Pinnington said.The German carmakers\u2019 digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals.\u201cThe future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together,\u201d said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm.Taken together, the carmakers\u2019 digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germany\u2019s vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States.But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology.The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germany\u2019s historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world.That is where Mr. Harms comes in.A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks.MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Mr. Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations.\u201cThe whole mobility market \u2014 transportation as a service \u2014 is just at the beginning,\u201d Mr. Harms said.Under Mr. M\u00fcller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least two million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service available in cities including New York and London.But for Mr. Harms, the carmakers\u2019 best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry \u2014 and other traditional sectors \u2014 to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful.\u201cA vehicle is extremely sensitive. You can\u2019t put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the ones who already know how to do it very well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: An Upwelling of Outrage Against a Presidential Action", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsFirst: Snap (the maker of Snapchat) finally unveiled its I.P.O. documents. It\u2019s been years since a big American consumer tech company went public, so everyone on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley has been salivating over Snap\u2019s debut on the market. And what we learned can be boiled down to two sentences: Snap is making a whole lot of money. And it\u2019s losing even more.Another interesting data point was the size of its user base. Snapchat has about 160 million daily users. That\u2019s not small! But it\u2019s not that big, either, compared to Facebook and Instagram. It\u2019s more in line with Twitter, which is not doing all that well.Here\u2019s Snap\u2019s problem. Part of what made companies like Facebook so successful is this economic term and Silicon Valley buzzphrase: network effects. Essentially, the larger a network gets, the more people tend to find value in it. Facebook is the classic example of positive network effects strengthening the site over time.Snapchat has a bit more difficult time doing that. It doesn\u2019t have a follower model similar to Facebook\u2019s, which means it takes a bit more effort to find new or interesting people to interact with on Snapchat. Also, content posted by people who aren\u2019t your friends isn\u2019t easily discoverable, another issue of keeping people engaged, in my mind.A lot of folks compare Snapchat to Twitter, which I think is a pretty apt way of looking at it. Both companies really rely on brand advertising \u2014 basically, high-dollar accounts from huge advertisers rather than a bunch of smaller accounts that make up the long tail of revenue \u2014 and that seems to pale in comparison to the advertisers that go with, say, Google or Facebook.And, as Facebook will tell you all day long, advertisers love targeting data, which Facebook has in droves. Snapchat, less so.This is moving much faster than I thought it would. I\u2019m not surprised Silicon Valley is a liberal bastion; I am surprised that workers here reacted so strongly to the new order. Were you? And where do you think this goes?And to your earlier point, the speed of how people mobilized so quickly was indeed breathtaking. I think a lot of it had to do with a feeling of helplessness among people that I heard about quite a bit. They wanted to do something, hence the protests, but also deleting and boycotting Uber felt satisfying to many, like they were taking a stand. We\u2019ll see if that blows over now that Travis is off the council.If that\u2019s not towering hypocrisy, I don\u2019t know what is.Till next week?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel, in Show of Support for Trump, Announces Factory in Arizona", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe completion of the factory, which will complement two other Intel semiconductor plants in Chandler, Ariz., had been under consideration for several years.Standing beside Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s chief executive, said the company had decided to proceed now because of \u201cthe tax and regulatory policies we see the administration pushing forward.\u201dMr. Trump said: \u201cThe people of Arizona will be very happy. It\u2019s a lot of jobs.\u201dHe said Intel called the White House several weeks ago to coordinate the announcement. That outreach illustrates the tightrope that Silicon Valley companies are walking as they deal with a president most of them did not want to see in office.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.Stacy J. Smith, the executive vice president who oversees manufacturing and sales, said Intel considered itself apolitical. \u201cIntel engages, whatever the administration,\u201d he said in an interview after Wednesday\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe focus on the issues that we care about.\u201dIntel said it agreed with Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to improve the investment climate for American manufacturers. \u201cIn places where we believe the policies are in the best interest of the company, we lean in,\u201d Mr. Smith said.In other areas, such as Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to curb immigration and end free-trade agreements, Intel disagrees, and it is telling the White House so. \u201cWe care about hiring the best and brightest people around the world,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWe care about exporting our products all over the world.\u201d\u201cWhen we disagree, we don\u2019t walk away,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation.\u201dIntel\u2019s political action committee gave about equally to Democratic and Republican candidates during the last election cycle. Individual employees donated far more to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign than to Mr. Trump\u2019s. But over all, the company is not a major political donor.New chip plants are tremendously expensive, requiring large tracts of land, reliable electricity and water, and a skilled work force that includes people with doctorates in chemistry and technicians who can repair a malfunctioning robot. Sophisticated equipment is necessary to deposit and etch microscopic layers of material on silicon wafers, which are then cut and packaged into the microprocessors that run personal computers, servers, smartphones and, increasingly, other electronic devices.Countries compete to land such plants, especially modern factories that produce the most valuable chips and bring high-paying research and development jobs. Government subsidies are common, with China vowing to spend tens of billions of dollars to expand its domestic chip industry.While most technology manufacturing, such as computers and smartphones, has moved overseas, American factories still account for about one-seventh of global chip production and produce many of the most valuable computer chips, including Intel\u2019s flagship processors. Seventy-six chip plants are scattered across the United States, from South Portland, Me., to Newport Beach, Calif., according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.The industry is seeking corporate tax cuts and incentives for research and development. In addition, chip makers would like to see the United States government relax longstanding national security restrictions on the export of new chip technology. In Intel\u2019s case, the regulations forbid the company from making its high-end processors in China.Mr. Smith said Mr. Trump had offered Intel no financial incentives to complete the Arizona factory.The plant was conceived in 2011. President Barack Obama visited the site in 2012, when construction had just begun, and he praised the plant as an example of \u201can America where we build stuff and make stuff and sell stuff all over the world.\u201dBut it was mothballed in 2014 after sales of personal computers \u2014 and the Intel chips that go into them \u2014 started to slide. Intel restructured its business and announced last year that it was laying off 12,000 people, including 560 in Chandler. The company now employs about 50,000 people in the United States and 106,000 worldwide.As Intel looks beyond servers and personal computers to new markets like other Internet-connected devices, cars and tablets, sales are growing again, and it will need the new factory when it is completed in a couple of years. \u201cWe\u2019re building it for our own business reasons,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The plant will build ultradense chips that Intel refers to as seven nanometer, with transistors packed more closely together than in the chips the company now builds. The tighter spacing allows for faster, more energy-efficient chips. \u201cThis factory will produce the most powerful computer chips on the planet,\u201d Mr. Krzanich said.Intel, one of the original chip companies, from which Silicon Valley gets its name, is based in Santa Clara, Calif. But most of its chip production is in Oregon and Arizona. It also has factories in China, Ireland and Israel.An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misstated the year that an Intel factory was under construction. It was 2012, not 2002.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla S Falls Short of Luxury Rivals on Tougher Safety Test", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a more rigorous safety review has reached a different conclusion: that the Tesla S is not on a par with several of its luxury rivals.To be a 2017 Top Safety Pick, a vehicle must have \u201cgood\u201d ratings in five crash tests and have an \u201cadvanced\u201d or a \u201csuperior\u201d rating for frontal crash prevention, which includes automatic emergency braking if a collision is imminent. To receive the higher 2017 Top Safety Pick+ designation, a vehicle must meet all those criteria and get an \u201cacceptable\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d headlight rating, which was added for 2017.The Model S got an \u201cacceptable\u201d in the small overlap frontal, a test intended to replicate what happens when the front corner of a vehicle on the driver\u2019s side hits another vehicle, a tree or a utility pole at 40 miles per hour.The seatbelt was not tight enough, the institute found, allowing the crash test dummy\u2019s torso to be thrown so far forward that its head hit the steering wheel through the airbag. The impact was hard enough that it could cause a concussion or facial fractures in a real crash, said David Zuby, the organization\u2019s executive vice president and chief research officer. But there was not a \u201chigh risk\u201d of serious injury.\u201cThe seatbelt force limiter and airbag did not work together quite the way we think is good for this type of crash,\u201d he said.The car\u2019s headlights were rated \u201cpoor.\u201dThe insurance institute did not test the Model S\u2019s forward collision prevention and automatic braking system because it bought the car before Tesla added new hardware and software in October.On Jan. 23, Tesla made a change to address the head contact issue, Mr. Zuby said. The insurance institute will conduct a new small overlap test and will test the forward collision avoidance system when it receives a new vehicle with the changes.Tesla says its Model S still has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And when the insurance institute gets its new Model S with modifications, Tesla says it expects \u201cto receive the highest possible rating in every category, making Model S eligible for the I.I.H.S. Top Safety Pick award.\u201dThe 2017 Model S was one of two all-electric vehicles the institute tested. The other, the BMW i3, narrowly missed one of the safety awards because its head restraints were rated \u201cacceptable,\u201d not \u201cgood.\u201dInstead of the Top Safety Pick+ designation going to these two luxury cars, it went to two less-expensive plug-in hybrids, the 2017 Chevrolet Volt and Toyota Prius Prime.\u201cConsumers might expect that luxury brand vehicles are safer, and in many cases they\u2019d be right,\u201d Mr. Zuby said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a hard and fast rule.\u201dThe insurance institute recommended that people choose any of the seven other 2017 large luxury models that have fared better than the Model S. The Top Safety Pick+ rating went to the Genesis G90 and G80 models, made by Hyundai, and the Lexus RC. Four rated \u201cTop Safety Pick\u201d are the Acura RLX, Audi A6, Infiniti Q70 and Volvo S90.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Activism Hits Even the Less Flashy Tech Companies", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As soon as President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, some of the biggest tech companies went quiet. Their executives did not sign legal briefs, brandish statements or dissent on Twitter. They strove for business as usual.This was the older, stodgier, less glamorous part of the tech universe. These executives are generally not household names. Most of the companies have little presence in the excitable consumer marketplace. Some are government contractors. Their workers tend to be more settled, less tempted by cool start-ups. Despite the companies\u2019 sizable employment, the spotlight is not on them.Among these firms are IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Qualcomm, Cisco, Dell and Oracle. When 127 companies signed an amicus brief last week in a Seattle court that said the executive order \u201cviolates the immigration laws and the Constitution,\u201d none of these six firms were on the list.Yet even at some of these companies, there are stirrings of defiance. In a few well-publicized cases, workers have noisily quit. Many more have chosen to remain but are agitating for an explicit corporate morality even as Mr. Trump considers a new executive order on immigration. They want their companies to make clear not only what they support but also, perhaps even more important, what lines they will not cross.The activist push is being driven in significant measure by women, who are still fighting for their due in a male-dominated industry. But in an unlikely twist, the chief executives they are trying to influence at two major companies are female.\u201cIn some instances it is notable for a company to take a stand on an issue,\u201d said one of the women, Irene Scher, a regional vice president of sales. \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s notable not to have taken a stand.\u201dA co-chief executive of Oracle, Safra Catz, and the chief executive of IBM, Virginia Rometty, became advisers to Mr. Trump during the transition. \u201cI know that you are committed to help America\u2019s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people,\u201d Ms. Rometty wrote to him in November. Ms. Catz said in December, \u201cWe are with him and will help in any way we can.\u201dThe three friends who created the Oracle petition joined the company in August, when it acquired the company they worked for, Opower. They emphasize they are not at odds with their employer.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a criticism of Oracle,\u201d said one of them, Rachel Kane, a sales executive at Oracle Utilities. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them visibility into how individuals at the company feel.\u201d Oracle declined to comment.Cauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM, said she believed \u201cworkplaces have a responsibility to society \u2014 to the clients we serve, the employees we hire and the citizens who are impacted by our decisions.\u201d She said IBM had been \u201cprogressive\u201d in encouraging women\u2019s participation in technology and on other issues, but had not delivered on the immigration ban.\u201cIBM\u2019s decision not to actively stand up to the Trump administration and condemn this policy is extremely disturbing,\u201d she said.Dell and Cisco declined to comment. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.The internal debate at some of the big tech companies revolves around the question of engagement: Can you persuade more from the inside than the outside?The pro-engagement position has been expressed by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and a member of the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum. In a handful of cases, people have said they are canceling new Teslas because they view him as working for the president.Mr. Musk said he had made sure that the travel ban was discussed \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d at a Feb. 3 White House meeting. A spokeswoman said no further details were available.The answer did not satisfy everyone. As one critic replied to Mr. Musk on Twitter: \u201cYou are not advising Trump, you are giving him cover and validating his nonsense. You can do more good by taking a stand. Please.\u201dIBM released a statement that said Ms. Rometty had \u201cconveyed the company\u2019s views directly to the president and the secretary of Homeland Security\u201d on Feb. 3, \u201cincluding suggestions for how technology can help to promote both national security and lawful immigration.\u201dEd Barbini, vice president for corporate communications at IBM, said no further details were available. He noted that the company said in December that it would never participate in the building of a Muslim registry. He declined to comment on the petition.When a small group of IBM employees was drawing up the petition in November, it debated including a reference to the Nazis. IBM maintains that the accounts of its role in Hitler\u2019s regime are overblown and incendiary.\u201cWatson sacrificed short-term business interests in order to be on the right side of history, something IBM takes pride in today,\u201d the petition says.Daniel Hanley, one of the organizers, said the goal was \u201cto build an organization inside the company that can hold IBM accountable to our values, and serve as a model for tech workers at other companies.\u201d\u201cWhen his policies border on the unconstitutional, the criminal and the morally unjust,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI am here to oppose him in every possible and legal way.\u201dThat was on a Monday. Mr. Polisner told his boss that he would work through Friday. After the letter became public, Mr. Polisner was fired immediately. At 56, he said, he probably would have worked at Oracle for a few more years if politics had not intervened.\u201cThere are different ways to influence,\u201d Mr. Polisner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal decision. I chose this one.\u201dMs. Scher at Oracle and her friends chose another.\u201cWe all participated in the Women\u2019s March,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible we\u2019re feeling a heightened sense of civic responsibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here are some other things that happened.So a shocking thing happened this week: A subsidiary of Facebook copied a feature from Snapchat.I have no problem with this; as I\u2019ve argued repeatedly, I think it\u2019s generally good for consumers and innovation online when companies freely copy each other\u2019s best software ideas. Still, it\u2019s got to be just a little bit embarrassing for Facebook, which has been at the forefront of the social game for so long, to have completely run out of original ideas.As a columnist, I know that feeling well.Anyway, I\u2019m used to social media giants cloning each other\u2019s features, but I don\u2019t think WhatsApp should have gone in this direction.People loved WhatsApp partly because it is a zero-nonsense, intuitive chatting app. So now WhatsApp\u2019s new feature, called Status, basically lets people share images, GIFs or videos before they self-destruct in 24 hours. But do you know anyone who uses WhatsApp and desires features like these?I mostly see people using WhatsApp to keep in touch with others overseas. I\u2019m not sure this will stick with consumers or help Facebook lure people away from Snapchat. All it does is add a layer of complexity to what was otherwise a perfectly solid messaging app that everyone knew how to use.Uber has pledged an investigation on the sexism charges, but it\u2019s not at all clear that will be enough to quell the mounting anger against the company both internally and externally.So, where do you think this goes next?Mike\u2019s reporting on this fiasco was truly stunning, and Uber\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cWe are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone\u201d \u2014 is remarkable in that there is no denial or justification whatsoever of the aggressive, chauvinistic work culture. Their next step, PR-wise, is to show the steps they are taking to \u201cheal.\u201d\u201cTo us, this decision is yet another example of Uber\u2019s continued unwillingness to be open, transparent and direct,\u201d they said.This is something new in tech \u2014 you don\u2019t ordinarily see investors calling out their companies. So it seems like Uber is going to have to do something much bigger and less superficial here\u2026. I think.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Opposition to Trump Propelled by Employees, Not Executives", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late September, a group of tech leaders started a well-publicized effort to raise $100,000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324.For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent.No longer.Nearly 100 technology companies said that President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries would violate both immigration law and the United States Constitution.\u201cSilicon Valley is stepping up,\u201d said Sam Altman, who runs the valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, Y Combinator. \u201cThe companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don\u2019t support.\u201dIt is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable \u2014 not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.\u201cPeople voted with their feet, and Travis listened,\u201d said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. \u201cWe need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.\u201dResistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a voice with the president if you didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.\u201dWhen President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, he upended the fates of people who had waited for years to get into the U.S. Here are portraits of those affected by the ban.Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,\u201d said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey all have the same leanings.\u201dMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google\u2019s former slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is the most forceful expression of this.\u201cIf you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,\u201d Mr. Shotts said.Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards,\u201d and saying it would create \u201cmuch collateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dThe immigration battle is in Microsoft\u2019s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\u201cIn 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,\u201d said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. \u201cThe most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.\u201dMr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous \u201cfor the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren\u2019t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can\u2019t fix the monetization of fake news.\u201dPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.\u201cI\u2019ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,\u201d said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.He talked about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which asks women, \u201cWhat would you do if you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201d Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women\u2019s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.\u201cWe have to protest in public,\u201d he said. The event raised $30,000 for the legal aid groups.\u201cIt looked like two-thirds of the room were newcomers,\u201d Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement.\u201cI want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re pushing at least as hard as Trump is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber C.E.O. to Leave Trump Advisory Council After Criticism", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Travis Kalanick needed everyone to take a deep breath.The chief executive of Uber was holding a regularly scheduled all-hands meeting on Tuesday at the ride-hailing company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters when he faced an onslaught of questions from upset employees.\u201cWhat would it take for you to quit the economic council?\u201d at least two employees asked at the Tuesday meeting.On Thursday, Mr. Kalanick gave his answer, stepping down from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory council. \u201cThere are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,\u201d Mr. Kalanick wrote in an email to employees obtained by The New York Times.Outside of the internal pressure, Uber faced other fallout from Mr. Kalanick\u2019s stance. More than 200,000 customers had deleted their accounts.In addition, Uber rivals had seized the moment to attack the company and bolster their own businesses. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance sent emails to the news media calling attention to Uber\u2019s ties to Mr. Trump, and organized a protest at Uber\u2019s New York office for Thursday. Lyft, another ride-hailing service, pledged to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union and has seen its app shoot toward the top of the download charts.Uber drivers, many of them immigrants who work for the ride-hailing company on a freelance basis, were also upset.Email from Travis Kalanick, chief of Uber, announcing that he was stepping down from President Trump\u2019s economic advisory council.Uber has set aside $3 million for a legal-defense fund to support drivers, offering help with translation services and round-the-clock telephone access to legal aid.For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was especially fraught. Other corporate chiefs, including Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX, and Mary Barra of General Motors, are also on the president\u2019s economic advisory team. Mr. Musk said on Twitter this week that the group of economic advisers planned to come to some sort of \u201cconsensus\u201d on immigration, and to influence Mr. Trump by engaging directly with him rather than cutting off ties completely.Internally, Uber staff members also began piling on the pressure. According to nearly a dozen current and former Uber engineers and product managers who attended or were briefed on the Tuesday all-hands meeting, employees said they were concerned that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s willingness to work with Mr. Trump after the immigration order would color Uber as a soulless company that cared only about its bottom line.Some told Mr. Kalanick that they had suffered a personal cost \u2014 a stigma, they said \u2014 of working at Uber. One staff member asked him to present the benefits of working at Uber that could outweigh that personal cost.Mr. Kalanick replied that he believed that change could be best effected through engagement, and through the work they did every single day.Many employees were not satisfied with his answer. On Wednesday, Uber staff members followed up by circulating a 25-page Google document titled \u201cLetters to Travis\u201d to tell the chief executive how and why his willingness to engage with the administration had affected them.By Thursday morning, Mr. Kalanick had reversed his position on engaging with Mr. Trump. His participation in the economic advisory council had created what he called a \u201cperception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are.\u201dIn his email to employees, he said his participation was being interpreted as a sign that he had endorsed the president and the administration\u2019s agenda. In fact, Mr. Kalanick said, the immigration order was hurting many people across America.\u201cImmigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country\u2019s success and quite honestly to Uber\u2019s,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Kalanick said he had spoken briefly with Mr. Trump to let him know he was withdrawing from the advisory council.\u201cPlease know, your questions and stories on Tuesday, along with what I heard from drivers, have kept me resilient and reminded me of one of our most essential cultural values, Be Yourself,\u201d Mr. Kalanick wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Wouldn\u2019t Work Without Immigrants", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The workers of Silicon Valley make unlikely revolutionaries. As a group, they are relatively wealthy, well educated and well connected.While most here supported Hillary Clinton, tech workers are not the most obvious targets of President Trump\u2019s policy ideas. Many who populate the world\u2019s richest tech companies will be just fine if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. Most will not be personally inconvenienced by the proposed Mexican border wall.Under Mr. Trump, tech workers could enjoy a windfall. They may get tax credits for child care costs, their companies may be allowed to repatriate foreign profits, and their coming income tax cuts might fund a luxury vacation or two.\u201cSilicon Valley is unlikely, as a phenomenon \u2014 it is not the default state of the world,\u201d said John Collison, an immigrant from Ireland who is a co-founder of Stripe, a six-year-old payments start-up based in San Francisco.One important reason Silicon Valley can exist at all, he said, is that it is welcoming to people from far outside its borders. \u201cI go all across the world, and every other place is asking, \u2018How do we replicate Silicon Valley where we are \u2014 in London, in Paris, in Singapore, in Australia?\u2019\u201dThe reason those places have so far failed to create their own indomitable tech hubs is that everyone there wants to come here.\u201cThe U.S. is sucking up all the talent from all across the world,\u201d Mr. Collison said. \u201cLook at all the leading technology companies globally, and look at how overrepresented the United States is. That\u2019s not a normal state of affairs. That\u2019s because we have managed to create this engine where the best and the brightest from around the world are coming to Silicon Valley.\u201dBut, Mr. Collison added, \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of fragile.\u201d Under Mr. Trump, the immigrant-friendly dynamic could change \u2014 and it could bring about the ruin of American tech.And yet even a casual trip through most histories of the technology industry reveals an outsize role played by immigrants.Collectively, these companies, which include householdish names like Uber, Tesla and Palantir, had created thousands of jobs and added billions of dollars to the American economy. Their founders came from all over the world \u2014 India, Britain, Canada, Israel and China, among lots and lots of other points around the globe.That should come as no surprise if you are familiar with the origins of the most iconic companies of the last few decades. One of Google\u2019s founders is an immigrant from Russia, and its current chief executive is an immigrant from India. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive is also from India. EBay and Yahoo were started by immigrants. Facebook\u2019s largest subsidiaries, Instagram and WhatsApp, were both co-founded by immigrants. Apple was started by a child of immigrants.But if that criticism rings true in some parts of the tech industry, it misses the picture among Silicon Valley\u2019s top companies. One common misperception of Silicon Valley is that it operates like a factory; in that view, tech companies can hire just about anyone from anywhere in the world to fill a particular role.But today\u2019s most ambitious tech companies are not like factories. They\u2019re more like athletic teams. They\u2019re looking for the LeBrons and Bradys \u2014 the best people in the world to come up with some brand-new, never-before-seen widget, to completely reimagine what widgets should do in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s not about adding tens or hundreds of thousands of people into manufacturing plants,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the co-founder and chief executive of the cloud-storage company Box. \u201cIt\u2019s about the couple ideas that are going to be invented that are going to change everything.\u201dIf you look at some of the most consequential ideas in tech, you find an unusual number that were developed by immigrants. For instance, Google\u2019s entire advertising business \u2014 that is, the basis for the vast majority of its revenues and profits, the engine that allows it to hire thousands of people in the United States \u2014 was created by three immigrants: Salar Kamangar and Omid Kordestani, who came to the United States from Iran, and Eric Veach, from Canada.But it\u2019s not just a numbers thing. Another reason immigrants do so well in tech is that people from outside bring new perspectives that lead to new ideas.Mike Krieger, an immigrant from Brazil who is a co-founder of Instagram, the photo-based social network app, said one reason it found instant, international success was that he purposely eliminated most text from the app. He knew from growing up in Brazil that English would hinder adoption in most parts of the world.\u201cEvery step of the way while we were creating it,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were thinking, can you create something with international appeal?\u201dMr. Collison, of Stripe, said he could not imagine creating a company without immigrants. \u201cIn the early stages of a start-up you usually have a very specific set of things you need to do, and there\u2019s a very short list of people who are able to do them,\u201d he said.In its early years, Stripe needed engineers and executives to build its system for moving money around the world; it needed to create a novel machine-learning system to detect fraud; and it had to convince regulators and other businesses that it was safe and legal to process payments through Stripe. The people it found for all these roles happened to be immigrants.\u201cThe fact that we can do that in Silicon Valley \u2014 the fact that the talent is here or that we can bring the talent here, that\u2019s what makes the whole thing work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Self-Driving Car Unit Accuses Uber of Using Stolen Technology", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google\u2019s parent company, claimed in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that Uber was using intellectual property stolen by one of Google\u2019s former project leaders.In a federal court filing in San Francisco, Waymo said Anthony Levandowski, who runs Uber\u2019s autonomous car division, downloaded 14,000 files from Google a month before leaving to start his own self-driving car company, Otto. Uber acquired Otto in August for $680 million, about seven months after Mr. Levandowski left Google.\u201cOtto and Uber have taken Waymo\u2019s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology,\u201d the company said in the filing. \u201cUltimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymo\u2019s expense.\u201dUber did not respond to requests for comment.In its filing, Waymo said it was inadvertently copied on an email from one of its suppliers with drawings of Uber\u2019s circuit board design for its lidar technology, short for light detection and ranging, \u201d that are laser-based sensors used in self-driving cars. Waymo said Uber\u2019s design bore \u201ca striking resemblance\u201d to its proprietary and highly secret design and infringed on Waymo\u2019s patents.Waymo also said that a number of Google employees, who subsequently left to join Mr. Levandowski at Otto, downloaded additional trade secrets before departing. These included supplier lists, manufacturing details and technical information, Waymo said.The suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology.Otto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort.He is a prominent figure in the world of self-driving vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a self-driving motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagon\u2019s first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on self-driving cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up, 510 Systems.Companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on self-driving car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits.The self-driving car company spun out from Google accused the ride-hailing service of advancing its own autonomous vehicle push by using intellectual property stolen by one of Google\u2019s former project leaders.In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the company\u2019s Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new self-driving car company. Tesla\u2019s suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information.Alphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its self-driving technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber.For Uber, Otto represents a significant bet on the future of transportation. Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Uber\u2019s self-driving technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the company\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the company\u2019s testing and self-driving efforts.Uber has also struck a deal with Volvo to jointly develop a self-driving vehicle, the XC-90; early versions of it have been released in some cities.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Uber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet.Mr. Holder and Tammy Albarran, a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling who is working on the investigation, said the inquiry would be \u201cthorough, impartial and objective.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the Billionaires Come From", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the early 20th century, a young journalist named Napoleon Hill embarked on the assignment of a lifetime.Mr. Hill set out to study hundreds of the nation\u2019s most successful people and write a book about how they became so accomplished.Mr. Hill spent two decades analyzing the life stories, strategies and personal philosophies of entrepreneurs and industrialists like Henry Ford, William Wrigley and John D. Rockefeller.The resulting book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d was published in 1937 and became a self-help guide for everyday Americans seeking great wealth.Mr. Hill tried to convince his readers \u2014 many of them emotionally and financially battered by the Great Depression \u2014 that with the right attitude they, too, could amass a fortune.\u201cOne must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes first did a certain amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, desiring and planning before they acquired money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Eighty years later, Mr. Hill\u2019s egalitarian notions seem to ring hollow on many levels. There is a troublingly wide gap between the economic fortunes of the rich and the poor \u2014 an inequality that has helped unleash political populism in Europe and the United States. (Ironically, President Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire, rode that resentment to the White House.)The idea that the secret to great wealth comes from a combination of discipline, perseverance and belief in yourself sounds Pollyannaish in an era of widespread disillusionment with how the economy and society actually works.Indeed, the chance of becoming a billionaire remains incredibly slim. Wealth-X, a research firm that tracks global wealth, said there were 2,473 billionaires in 2015, an increase of 148 from the year before and about 0.00003 percent of the world\u2019s 7.3 billion people.Still, an optimist like Mr. Hill, who died in 1970, might take heart in one data point from Wealth-X: More than half of the world\u2019s billionaires are self-made.And that number is increasing. Self-made billionaires represent 57 percent of total billionaire wealth, or more than $4.3 trillion, a figure that was up 7 percent from 2014. Meanwhile, the number of billionaires with inherited wealth \u2014 323, according to Wealth-X \u2014 fell by 29 percent from 2014.The booming technology sector has minted many of the recent self-made titans \u2014 entrepreneurs like Travis Kalanick, a co-founder and the chief executive of Uber, and the co-founders of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk.\u201cMany people have great ideas. But to grow an idea into a huge business is a different matter,\u201d said Maya Imberg, custom research director at Wealth-X. \u201cBillionaires tend to be incredibly focused.\u201dIn his book, Mr. Hill tried to show that qualities like focus and perseverance were within everyone.He told the story of how Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he perfected the incandescent electric light bulb and how Henry Ford pushed his engineers to develop the V-8 motor despite the technical challenges.\u201cA thousand people could be pointed out who have a better education than Ford\u2019s, yet they live in poverty because they do not possess the right plan for the accumulation of money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Wealth-X is the big data equivalent to Mr. Hill\u2019s one-man reporting project. The firm employs about 150 researchers across the world who collect and analyze data about the richest people.Based on that data, you may have a slightly better chance of becoming a billionaire if you went to Harvard, which was the most popular school among billionaires by a wide margin. (Stanford came in second.)Engineering degrees were the most popular among billionaires, followed by business, according to Approved Index, another firm that researches the wealthy. There are some notable billionaires with humanities degrees, like the financier Carl Icahn, who majored in philosophy at Princeton. Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has a teaching degree.It is well known that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft dropped out of Harvard to start their businesses. But they are not alone. About 30 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires never obtain a college degree.\u201cIt is counterintuitive to what you are told growing up,\u201d said Grace Garland, head of research at Approved Index.If the sheer numbers are any guide, your chances of becoming a billionaire as a woman are especially remote. In 2015, 140 of the 148 people who broke into the billionaire ranks were men. All of the top 10 billionaires are men, according to Wealth-X.And yet for all the male-dominated, Ivy League exclusivity of the billionaire\u2019s club, self-help gurus and ordinary people continue to pore over the biographies and public statements of the ultrawealthy, looking for the secret sauce.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, and the investor Warren E. Buffett are said to be avid readers. Mr. Gates once said that \u201creading is still the main way that I both learn new things and test my understanding.\u201dMr. Collins said many of these wealthy men had parents who helped them to succeed.Mr. Gates\u2019 parents arranged for him to take time off from classes during his senior year in high school to work on code for the electrical grid management system at a local power plant.Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of Virgin Group, said his father, a lawyer, taught him the importance of dreaming big and instilled in him a desire for excellence.Mr. Collins said that while he was growing up in Australia, his father made him read \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d and taught him how to think about making money in different ways to accumulate wealth.\u201cThe people who say that entrepreneurs are born, that is ridiculous. They are made,\u201d he said.\u201cYou need grit and unwavering personal confidence. Those are nonnegotiable in a billionaire,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With a Saw and a Big Budget, Owners Transform Cars Into Convertibles", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheels6 PhotosA few days ago, Jeff Moran fired up an electric Sawzall cutting tool and sheared off the roof of a new Dodge Challenger sedan. Next week he\u2019s going to decapitate another car, probably a Cadillac ATS.At first glance it might seem a crazy idea, but to Mr. Moran it\u2019s a growing business. His company, Drop Top Customs, in High Springs, Fla., specializes in extreme automotive makeovers \u2014 mainly of turning cars like the Challenger and the ATS into convertibles.\u201cWe did 60, 65 cars last year, and we\u2019ll probably do twice that this year,\u201d Mr. Moran said by telephone while taking a break from vehicular surgery. \u201cI think we\u2019re coming into a nice upswing again.\u201dThe rising demand at Drop Top Customs is a stark contrast to the overall convertibles business. Car sales in general are slumping, as Americans flock to roomy models like sport utility vehicles that are more suited to family life and active living. And convertible sales are in a tailspin.Automakers sold just over 111,000 convertibles in the first 11 months of 2016, according to Edmunds.com, an auto-shopping website. A total for the full year has not yet been compiled. But considering that few convertibles are sold in cold-weather months, the industry is sure to register a steep decline from the 2015 total of almost 134,000.Fewer than 1 percent of all the new vehicles sold in the American market are convertibles. Back in their heyday, in the \u201960s, they made up about 6 percent of the total.\u201cA lot of people like the idea of a convertible on a sunny day, but for a daily drive, it can be a grind,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com. \u201cThey\u2019re just not very practical unless it is your second or third car.\u201dAs sales have declined, automakers have pulled many convertible models, like the Toyota Solara, Pontiac Solstice and Ford Thunderbird, as well as the drop-top versions of the Chrysler Sebring, PT Cruiser, Lexus SC and Mini Cooper. Among those still chugging along: the Ford Mustang, the Chevrolet Camaro and a variety of expensive models from European luxury brands.Topless driving, with the sun shining in, retains its powerful allure for some people, though, even as convertibles lose their broader appeal. That is where businesses like Drop Top Customs have stepped in.After the factory-built roofs are buzzed off, Mr. Moran and his crew install convertible tops of his own design. He also welds additional steel supports to the underbody, to make up for the strength and stiffness that the rigid roof normally provides. Doors, windows, seatbelts and other parts are modified, too. He charges $18,000, and has a backlog of orders.Last year, Dale Laur, a nurse anesthetist from North Branch, Mich., ordered a 2016 Dodge Challenger with a Hemi V8 engine and a purple finish \u2014 \u201cPlum Crazy,\u201d it\u2019s called. He had the car shipped directly from the factory to Drop Top Customs in High Springs, 75 miles southwest of Jacksonville.\u201cI just love how it feels in a convertible,\u201d Mr. Laur said. \u201cIt\u2019s freedom, wind in your hair.\u201dAfter the transformation was complete, Mr. Laur flew down to Florida, picked up the car and headed north. On the road and at most every stop, he said, people stared and took pictures of the car. While still on the road, he learned one of the photos had already found its way onto a Detroit muscle car blog.\u201cThe reactions were unbelievable because most people had never seen a Challenger convertible before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d be riding along the freeway and people were pulling up next to us, waving and taking pictures, thumbs up.\u201dKen Kelly, a classic car dealer from Texas, had Drop Top Customs modify a 2013 Challenger SRT8, and people would come up and offer to buy the car. He sold it after about a year, making enough to cover all his costs and then some. He recently bought a Hellcat Challenger, which features a huge 707-horsepower Hemi engine, and has sent it off to Mr. Moran, too.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it will be the only Hellcat Challenger convertible in existence,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. He figures he\u2019ll drive it for a bit and then sell it for a profit.It takes about two to three weeks to change a sedan into a convertible. Before any cutting begins, the car is stripped of its hood, body panels, seats and interior. Next, steel supports, mainly square tubing, are welded to the underbody and behind the wheels. All told, about 200 pounds of steel are added to the car.Mr. Moran is not an engineer, but he draws on a long previous career as a police officer specializing in accident reconstruction, work that gave him knowledge of how cars are built to withstand crashes.Once the steel is in place, the cutting begins and the roof is removed. New power windows replace the fixed windows in the rear seat. Small connectors or jigs that will secure the new folding roof are welded to the car\u2019s body, and then the roof itself is welded in place.Mr. Moran noted that all his components are American made. Glass windows come from Ohio, the tops from the Carolinas, hydraulic cylinders from Kentucky.Drop Top Customs isn\u2019t the only company filling the desires of people like Mr. Laur. Newport Convertible Engineering in Southern California also creates convertibles. Much of its work involves high-end luxury cars, like Ferraris and Lamborghinis. It has offices in Dubai and Barcelona, Spain, to serve customers in the Middle East and Europe.\u201cThere are wealthy people around the world who have no issue with money, and they will spend whatever it takes to get something that\u2019s truly unique,\u201d said Al Zadeh, who founded Newport Convertible Engineering in 1983.The company is working on an order for 100 Tesla Model S convertibles from an investor who hopes to turn a profit selling them to rich car enthusiasts in China and elsewhere. This week it also announced a plan to create convertible versions of the Ford F-150 pickup truck.\u201cWe think this is going to be a big hit,\u201d Mr. Zadeh said. \u201cIt will sell like hot cakes.\u201dEd Pobur, the general manager of a Cadillac dealership in Novi, Mich., thinks there\u2019s still potential for convertible sales. The ATS that Mr. Moran will cut into soon is one of two Mr. Pobur sent to Drop Top Customs to be transformed, and he\u2019s eager to have them in his showroom as spring arrives.\u201cWe\u2019re going to display them on the corner in front of the dealership. We\u2019ll put the top down to show it off,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully we\u2019ll be ordering a bunch more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Risky Business for C.E.O.s: An Invitation From Trump", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor the nation\u2019s top executives, a summons to the White House has long been a much-coveted honor.Now, less than a month into President Trump\u2019s administration, it\u2019s become something to be ducked, at least for some.A Trump invitation \u201chas become a double-edged sword because the population is so divided,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who organizes meetings of chief executives there.Then, executives were clamoring to make the cut, even those who had been cool or in some cases hostile to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Well over 100 chief executives approached Mr. Schwarzman and the Trump transition team angling to be included.Only two people declined, citing time pressures: Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.The final list of 16 included such business luminaries as Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric; Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Bob Iger of Disney; Mary Barra of General Motors; and Virginia Rometty of IBM.Soon after, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors, Travis Kalanick of Uber and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo were added, buttressing the group\u2019s expertise in technology and consumer products.Then Mr. Trump was inaugurated and in short order unleashed his divisive immigration order, leading to chaos at airports and nationwide protests. Exactly one week later, on relatively short notice, he convened the first meeting of the forum, with live television coverage from the State Dining Room of the White House.Even though nearly every company represented in the forum issued a statement that to varying degrees distanced it from the immigration order or even denounced it, the images of the meeting risked looking like an endorsement of the Trump administration and its policies.Images of Mrs. Nooyi, an immigrant born in India (and now a citizen), who sat next to Mr. Schwarzman and within camera range of Mr. Trump, seemed especially incongruous.Mr. Kalanick was the first on the forum to feel the wrath of consumers. Protesters accused Uber of \u201ccollaborating\u201d with Mr. Trump and chained themselves to the doors of the company\u2019s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Soon after, the hashtag #DeleteUber trended on Twitter. Within four days of the immigration order, 200,000 users had deleted the Uber app, and one of the company\u2019s rivals, Lyft, reported that downloads of its own app had more than doubled.When I contacted him this week, Mr. Kalanick said: \u201cJoining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.\u201dProtest flared and a social media boycott campaign took root after the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, joined Mr. Trump\u2019s 28-member Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, announced in January, and then praised the president\u2019s pro-business policies on CNBC.Some Disney employees organized demonstrations in three cities this week, demanding that Mr. Iger resign from the forum, even though he didn\u2019t attend the first meeting because of a conflict with a long-scheduled company board meeting. The demonstrations drew about 120 protesters, the company said.At the same time, Out & Equal, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, praised Mr. Iger\u2019s membership in the forum in a letter to the company, citing his support for workplace equality and ability to influence the president.Mr. Schwarzman himself received some criticism from a few Schwarzman scholars, who receive support under a program he established for study in China. In a letter to the scholars explaining his role in advising Mr. Trump, Mr. Schwarzman wrote: \u201cIn life you\u2019ll often find that having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice. However, I have always believed one\u2019s obligation is to work for the common good.\u201dAs the Uber experience suggests, the risks of engaging with Mr. Trump are highest for companies with direct exposure to consumers, especially those who can easily switch to a competitor less identified with the Trump brand. General Motors and PepsiCo could face more consumer reaction; the banks and money managers less so; and industrial concerns like General Electric even less.At the same time, the benefits of being part of the forum and gaining the ear of the president are obvious: Virtually every Fortune 500 corporation has vitally important interests affected by the federal government, from antitrust, labor and trade policies, to tax reform and bank regulation, including changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.The comment seemed to underscore the degree to which Mr. Trump has turned regulation of Wall Street over to the bankers he railed against during the campaign. (Curiously, given Mr. Trump\u2019s stated hostility to Dodd-Frank, Mr. Dimon is on record as supporting many aspects of the legislation, saying it has made the banking system safer but has also made it more difficult for smaller banks to compete.)A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.And refusing Mr. Trump\u2019s invitations risks a presidential Twitter broadside, something that is unprecedented in American political and business history and whose impact is still being assessed. Yahoo Finance last week said it had sifted through more than 34,000 Trump tweets and identified attacks on 62 businesses, including at least two represented in the forum, General Motors and Boeing.(I asked the White House on Thursday for comment on its interaction with business leaders, but received no response.)Optics aside, Mr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said the president\u2019s overtures to executives represented a welcome change from the Obama administration, which largely ignored big business and summoned bankers to Washington to browbeat them publicly over the financial crisis. By comparison, Mr. Trump embraced members of his business forum as \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d and said he welcomed their ideas.\u201cThere\u2019s always the danger that chief executives will be used as photo ops,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld acknowledged. But he praised Mr. Trump\u2019s decision \u201cto give chief executives a seat at the table\u201d and said he had talked to at least half of the participants since the meeting. \u201cThey\u2019re telling me they found him very receptive to their ideas and willing to listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve said they\u2019re holding each other accountable to be truthful and candid and to raise key issues with him.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld has met with Mr. Trump since the election and offered advice. \u201cHe\u2019s very charming and open to new ideas,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen business executives melt in his presence.\u201dCharles Elson, a professor and expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware, also praised the president for reaching out to business leaders. He said he disagreed with Mr. Kalanick\u2019s decision to resign.\u201cWhen the president calls, you should go to see him, regardless of your political persuasion, out of respect for the office,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cAs a chief executive with a duty to your shareholders, it\u2019s your obligation to do so, like him or not.\u201dMr. Schwarzman\u2019s office made a similar point when I inquired this week. \u201cSteve has advised presidents from both parties in the past and feels a duty to help any administration that calls on him if he\u2019s able to do so for the good of the country,\u201d Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzman, said.Still, everyone I spoke to agreed that there were lines they wouldn\u2019t cross. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree\u201d with the president, Mr. Elson said. \u201cIf he asks you to take a political position, you can say no. And if he asks you to endorse something where you have a deep philosophical objection, you shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "SolarCity\u2019s Ties to Foreclosure Cases Raise Questions on Vetting Policies", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySolarCity, the nation\u2019s leading installer of rooftop solar panels and a renewable energy darling, has pitched its value to investors on a simple premise: Once customers sign up to lease a system, they will make payments to the company month after month for at least 20 years.But even when the customers look good enough on paper, it does not always work out that way.In dozens of cases over the last three years, The New York Times has found, SolarCity has reached long-term lease agreements with homeowners shortly before or even after they defaulted on mortgages. In at least 14 cases, the homeowners were already in default, or had other liens on the property, by the time SolarCity filed paperwork about the panels with the government.The cases raise questions about how well the company vets customers. In addition, it is unclear how many foreclosure lawsuits involve the company over all.In September, a lawyer for SolarCity, Mohammed Ahmed Gangat, filed a document in New York state court arguing that the company needed to file another document late because it had in recent months been \u201cinundated with hundreds of lawsuits in New York, and thousands across the country, all of which have named SolarCity as a defendant in a residential foreclosure action.\u201dBut when asked about that filing, SolarCity said that it was currently involved in far fewer cases \u2014 139 \u2014 and that the lawyer had been mistaken. The company said the court filing had been made without the company\u2019s reviewing or approving it. Mr. Gangat is not a SolarCity employee.\u201cOut of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe litigation is not adversarial \u2014 being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.\u201dThe company is also involved in foreclosure proceedings outside the courts but said it could not say how many.Mr. Gangat did not immediately respond to calls or emails.If the lawyer\u2019s figures are correct, SolarCity, which is now owned by the automaker Tesla, may be facing a threat to its financial performance that it has not disclosed to the government and investors. The foreclosures can lead to a pause, or an end, of the lucrative monthly payments customers pay for the leases.If the lawyer\u2019s figures are false, he could face disciplinary proceedings under ethics rules, depending on the circumstances. The company said it was planning to have the document filed in court on its behalf corrected.In either situation, details of the cases identified by The Times raise questions about how well the company, relying on one credit check, vets potential customers.What SolarCity offers its customers is simple in theory: savings on their electricity bills from the solar panels glistening on their roofs.The company often pays most or all of the bill for the installation, worth $25,000 to $30,000 on average, and charges the customer an agreed-upon rate for the electricity the panels produce, typically 10 to 15 percent less than they would normally pay for power. In return, SolarCity receives steady monthly payments.In the years since the company\u2019s founding in 2006, it has lowered the FICO score, the widely used credit score created by the Fair Isaac Corporation, it requires to get its solar panels. It now uses a score of 650, generally considered a \u201cfair\u201d rating, as the cutoff.But often, the score is assessed several months before a solar panel system is installed and registered \u2014 plenty of time for financial circumstances to change.\u201cFor a consumer with a sub-700 score, it\u2019s likely that there are already some indicators of risk there, but not a severe one to that particular lender, I guess, at that point,\u201d said Rod Griffin, director of public education at Experian, a credit reporting agency.SolarCity is not the only company to find itself in the midst of such lawsuits. Sunrun, a competitor, has been named in a small number of cases.The foreclosure lawsuits do not appear to have made much of a dent in SolarCity\u2019s bottom line. When a customer loses a home to a bank in foreclosure, the company also risks losing income from its energy system unless it can reach a deal to take the system back or contract with the new homeowners. Company executives say that even after figuring in foreclosures, more than 99 percent of contracts are ultimately reassigned, relocated or paid off in advance.When a customer loses a home to a bank, the ownership of the solar panels can become unclear. Banks often consider them part of the overall property as fixtures. SolarCity has argued that the panels are its \u201cpersonal property.\u201dThe company has succeeded in convincing some banks that the panels are not fixtures, according to court records. But several foreclosure lawyers who have not been involved with these cases said SolarCity might face an uphill battle, especially if it does not act in court to protect its ownership interest in the panels.\u201cSolarCity needs to contest every foreclosure to have any realistic chance of getting either paid for or the return of their solar panels,\u201d said Christopher McCormick, a lawyer in Connecticut who spent a decade representing banks in foreclosure proceedings and now defends homeowners in the cases.\u201cThose panels are pretty valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes sense that the company would not want to lose them.\u201dEven if foreclosures are a problem for SolarCity, its services may help some customers get by during rough financial times. Alexis Hickerson, a resident of West Haven, Conn., said she had the company install panels while she was still trying to work out a deal with her bank to keep her home after she and her husband lost money on investments.According to court records, Ms. Hickerson stopped paying her mortgage on Feb. 1, 2016. SolarCity filed paperwork with the government on May 6, 2016, about the installation. Ms. Hickerson said she was now going through a short sale of her home.Ms. Hickerson said her power bills had been lower with SolarCity. The company, she said, will be able to either lease its panels to the new buyers of her home or remove them.\u201cI am happy with SolarCity,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing that hasn\u2019t been a problem.\u201dFollow Danielle Ivory on Twitter @danielle_ivory.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Cabinet Is Mostly Bare. This Man Fills the Void.", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few weeks after the election, Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, was summoned to Trump Tower for a discussion about the economy. It would be the first of many such meetings with President-elect Donald J. Trump.During that sit-down, on Nov. 29, Mr. Cohn briefed Mr. Trump on what he regarded as the chief hurdle to expanding the economy, according to people who were briefed on the discussion: a stronger dollar, which would undermine efforts to create jobs.Mr. Cohn also argued that the bold infrastructure projects that Mr. Trump envisioned would need private-industry partners, those people said, in order to avoid weighing down the government with costs.That got Mr. Trump\u2019s attention.The president-elect turned to the other people in the room \u2014 his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; his chief of staff, Reince Priebus; and Steven T. Mnuchin, his campaign\u2019s chief fund-raiser and Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to be Treasury secretary \u2014 surprised that his infrastructure ideas had such a potential downside.\u201cIs this true?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the group, according to those people. Heads nodded. \u201cWhy did I have to wait to have this guy tell me?\u201d he demanded.It would not be the only time Mr. Cohn was a lonely voice in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner sanctum. Two and a half months after that initial meeting, with key economic posts in the White House and cabinet still vacant, he has become the go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth. He resigned from his position at Goldman in December to become director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council.People with knowledge of his new role said that Mr. Cohn, a Democrat, is summoned to the Oval Office for impromptu meetings with the president up to five times a day \u2014 and that he reaches out to the president on other occasions. Mr. Trump, said one of these people, is oriented toward the bottom line when it comes to shaping policy, often asking Mr. Cohn, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dThe direct access to the president has been crucial as Mr. Cohn navigates a White House where Mr. Bannon and the policy director Stephen Miller are power brokers whose worldviews differ from his, and where unexpected presidential complaints, broadcast on Twitter, can significantly recalibrate the day\u2019s agenda.Topping Mr. Cohn\u2019s current to-do list: corporate and individual tax reforms, to be carried out at the same time; improvements to infrastructure to create new jobs; and regulatory relief in general.He is also studying how to revamp the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign to repeal \u2014 a promise that is proving to be more complicated to keep than he had expected.Mr. Cohn is working with a health care specialist and consulting with House Republicans: Speaker Paul D. Ryan; Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader; and Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. Cohn is determining which aspects of the act may be worth keeping (allowing people to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26 and mandating coverage of people with pre-existing conditions) and which may not (allowing people to sign up for health insurance outside of the typical enrollment periods).Orin Snyder, a corporate litigator and longtime friend of Mr. Cohn\u2019s who speaks to him regularly, said, \u201cHe is working around the clock, energized and focused like a laser beam on developing the best plan for implementing the president\u2019s economic agenda.\u201dThis account of Mr. Cohn\u2019s role in economic matters, amid the tumultuous first three weeks of the Trump administration, is based on interviews with four people who have observed or been briefed on his transition from Goldman to the White House and his early work in the administration.Mr. Trump has already vowed to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulation law that was passed in 2010, and has ordered a reassessment of an Obama-era rule requiring financial advisers to act in the best interest of their clients. The efforts have helped push up stock markets, particularly shares of financial companies.They have also generated outrage in some quarters. \u201cThe way I see this, there was a devastating financial crisis just over eight years ago,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said. \u201cGoldman Sachs was at the heart of that crisis. The idea that the president is now going to turn over the country\u2019s economic policy to a senior Goldman executive turns my stomach.\u201dIt is not just that Mr. Cohn, 56, has a prominent role in economic policy; he is one of the few senior administration officials addressing those issues on the job right now. Questions of job creation and financial regulation might fall within the purview of not only the National Economic Council but also of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 a panel of experts that has historically operated within the White House \u2014 and the Treasury secretary. But Mr. Trump indicated on Wednesday that the vacant position of council chairman would not be cabinet-level, and Mr. Mnuchin has yet to be confirmed.Mr. Cohn collaborates frequently with Mr. Kushner, who is now a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. Along with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, Mr. Cohn recently helped persuade the president not to pursue an executive order that would have rolled back rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.And when Mr. Trump lashes out publicly at a major company or orders a travel ban that inspires wide criticism, from Silicon Valley to Goldman, Mr. Cohn hunkers down on the policy work, people who have observed him said.Mr. Cohn was not looking for a new job when he first encountered Mr. Kushner last year at the behest of Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent who is a mutual friend, according to two people with knowledge of that meeting. Despite the generational divide \u2014 Mr. Kushner is 36 \u2014 the men hit it off, the two people said, and after Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory on Nov. 8, a meeting with Mr. Cohn was quickly arranged.After the initial get-together at Trump Tower, at which a range of jobs were discussed, including energy secretary and director of the Office of Management and Budget, additional talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohn quickly followed, a person who was briefed on those discussions said.On Dec. 12, Mr. Cohn\u2019s new post as National Economic Council director was announced, touching off a rapid career transition that included making extensive financial disclosures, preparing to sell or forfeit an enormous amount of Goldman stock and walling himself off from pending matters that could have posed a conflict of interest.Still, Mr. Cohn\u2019s 26-year career at Goldman, where he performed an array of jobs, including trading commodities, running mortgages and eventually overseeing day-to-day operations, ended with a remarkable windfall: cash and stock valued at $285 million.Ms. Warren and other critics, who have raised questions about Mr. Cohn\u2019s communications with Goldman employees on policy matters since joining the government, find that sum objectionable.A White House spokeswoman had no immediate comment, and a spokesman for Goldman said in a statement that the firm had not been involved in formulating any of the president\u2019s executive orders.Since relocating to Washington, Mr. Cohn has lived in a hotel near the White House, traveling by cab early each day to his new office in time for an 8 a.m. senior staff meeting with Mr. Priebus. At the urging of Dina H. Powell, a former Goldman colleague who is now a presidential adviser, Mr. Cohn hired Jeremy Katz, a former George W. Bush aide, as his deputy. Kenneth Juster, another Bush administration veteran who had become a partner at the private-equity firm Warburg Pincus, was put in charge of international economic affairs.Business interests have been central in Mr. Trump\u2019s early governing, and he has met with chief executives from, among others, Dow Chemical, Tesla and Under Armour to discuss job creation and border taxes. He has also met with the heads of food corporations, financial-services companies and airlines. Mr. Cohn was present for most of those meetings.On taxes, regulations and health care initiatives, \u201cI give them an A-plus,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign who was briefly considered for the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cRegarding trade and the dollar, I\u2019m giving them an incomplete.\u201dCorporate tax reform should be on an even faster trajectory, Mr. Kudlow added. \u201cThe longer you wait on that, the longer economic activity will be postponed. Twenty seventeen could turn out to be a difficult economic and market year, until you get it done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Kevin Durant Became Silicon Valley\u2019s Hottest Start-up", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven so, every article on Mr. Durant seemed to boil down to this: He was too nice. And super-duper-stars aren\u2019t \u201cnice.\u201dThat narrative persisted until last June, when Mr. Durant, who had spent eight years dutifully toiling in small-market Oklahoma City for the Thunder, became one of the most heavily courted free agents in league history. The bidding war for his services was like a sports-world variation of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201dBut the funny thing about being in the eye of the hurricane? It\u2019s surprisingly calm there.Here is a look at Mr. Durant\u2019s life in the Bay Area over a recent two-day stretch between big wins against the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Thunder, as he made the rounds as arguably the hottest start-up in Silicon Valley.It was early afternoon on an unseasonably warm winter Tuesday, and Mr. Durant was in high spirits, barreling down the Bayshore Freeway in a black Cadillac Escalade on the way to a speaking engagement at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif.That morning, Mr. Durant was the centerpiece a lavish groundbreaking ceremony for the Chase Center, the $1 billion pleasure dome on the San Francisco waterfront that the team plans to occupy by 2019.With his six-foot-infinity frame and impossibly long legs, Mr. Durant seemed to swallow a yard of real estate with each stride. As an eight-time N.B.A. All-Star seemingly dressed for Pitti Uomo (he wore a blue custom suit, a striped pocket square and white Common Projects sneakers), Mr. Durant certainly stood out in the wood-beam suburban sports bar where a number of diners were decked out in blue-and-gold Warriors gear.Mr. Durant is comfortable with the level of scrutiny he receives in the Bay Area, meaning, not too much. \u201cHey, it\u2019s not L.A., it\u2019s not New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere in between.\u201dAlthough he has appeared on magazine covers for a decade, he still carries himself like a teenager. He slouched in the booth with his shoulders slumped, face buried in his iPhone before the food arrived.Once the conversation did start, however, Mr. Durant sounded pensive, introspective. Unlike many M.V.P.-caliber athletes who seem to field every question seemingly looking for the quickest exit strategy, Mr. Durant paused to consider each question, and he seemed unafraid to open up, despite his natural shyness.\u201cI didn\u2019t really have friends,\u201d Mr. Durant said of his childhood in Seat Pleasant, Md., which neighbors Washington. \u201cI was quiet. I was awkward-sized.\u201dRaised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood, Mr. Durant said he \u201cdidn\u2019t look the part\u201d of a cool kid, adding that, \u201cIt made it easy for me to not worry about the social life and just play basketball.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the gift and the curse of being an athlete that is so dedicated at an early age, you forget about real life sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just in the last few years starting to feel comfortable to meet new people, going out in groups, meeting new girls, hanging out. That stuff was foreign to me until a few years back.\u201dNear the end of the lunch, a petite woman in a Warriors jersey trailing two eager children approached the booth. \u201cExcuse me, Kevin?\u201d she asked diffidently. But a man in his security detail whisked her away before he could respond.Upon leaving the booth, however, Mr. Durant demonstrated his growing ease with fame among his adopted family of Warriors fans, making a beeline toward the woman\u2019s table to graciously pose for selfies with the family.\u201cThey can feel how much heat that I got from coming here,\u201d he said of his controversial move to Bay Area. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make me feel at peace.\u201dFifteen minutes later, the Escalade pulled into a parking garage beneath the sprawling YouTube campus. Mr. Durant had no time for a plunge down the office\u2019s 45-foot-long red slide, sink a 10-footer on the indoor putting green or grab a quick snooze in a Kubrickian, white-plastic \u201cnap pod.\u201d After all, he was the employee perk that day.He proceeded to an auditorium that was filled to capacity with YouTube employees, some of them looking barely old enough to vote, let alone drink, and took a seat onstage across from Neal Mohan, YouTube\u2019s chief product officer, who was moderating an employees-only question-and-answer session that was live-streamed to YouTube and Google offices around the world.Flashing a $59,000 Vacheron Constantin watch, Mr. Durant did not exactly fit the profile of the skinny-armed tech programmer. But he cast himself as just another member of the YouTube generation, talking about his obsession with Grand Theft Auto V, hip-hop and, of course, YouTube. \u201cI\u2019m sure you guys know, you want to look at one quick video and it turns into four or five hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dangerous, that app.\u201dWhen an audience member asked if he planned to try acting, like the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Blake Griffin or the Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James, Mr. Durant snorted sarcastically, \u201cIf anybody could do it, it\u2019s Blake Griffin and LeBron.\u201d The audience erupted in laughter, since both players are considered Oscar-worthy on-court floppers. Mr. Durant, holding back a chuckle, insisted that he was talking about their impressive work in commercials and movies.In a sense, Mr. Durant is not wholly unlike the legions of ambitious 20-somethings in hoodies and cool sneakers who descend on Silicon Valley to make hundreds of millions.The only difference is, he has already made hundreds of millions.The next day, Mr. Durant was piloting his black Tesla Model S up a windy road in the Oakland Hills, after the Warriors\u2019 morning shootaround. It was around noon on game day, the second meeting of the season with his former team, the Thunder. He seemed more distant that day, his voice quieter, raspier.Dressed in a gray Warriors hoodie, he steered into a hilltop cul-de-sac and pulled into a driveway of his sleek contemporary-style house, where he hopped out, plugged in the Tesla, and headed into the house through a garage where his black labradoodle Ro was resting peacefully.As his private chef hunched over the stove, preparing a game-day pasta meal, Mr. Durant slumped into the world\u2019s longest sectional sofa and stared out the soaring windows, which were rattling from the wind, toward downtown Oakland in the distance. He chose the house for the view.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to be on top of everything, see it from a different perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was at the bottom growing up.\u201dMr. Durant has been living in the 10,000-square-foot rental for only a few months, and as a bachelor who spends half his time on the road, it has a temporary feel to it. The white lilies on the kitchen table were silk, the fiddle-leaf fig plant in the corner of the family room was plastic.Still, it was decorated in a style that might be called Sports Superstar Moderne: the stark white walls are festooned with abstract Expressionist artwork, with ample trophies on display. The house has a home recording studio, a recreation room littered with Washington Redskins memorabilia, a movie theater that seats 16, and a walk-in closet devoted to sneakers.Mr. Durant padded barefoot past his hangar-size master bedroom, into another vast closet where he keeps his custom suits, jewelry and watches. The real treasure there, however, was his swelling collection of vintage concert T-shirts from the 1980s and \u201990s \u2014 Nas, Biggie, Metallica, Stone Cold Steve Austin. \u201cI take pride in my collection,\u201d he said.But what\u2019s the point of looking runway-ready in a culture where Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s sweatshirt sets the tone? Mr. Durant feels more at home in the Silicon Valley-approved wardrobe of jeans, sneakers and hoodies.\u201cFashion,\u201d he said, \u201cis what you make of it.\u201dBack in the family room, Mr. Durant paused in front of his frame wall containing a moody black-and-white photograph showing three clenched fists, each with a small triangle tattoo at the base of the thumb. One fist was Mr. Durant\u2019s, another belongs to Charlie Bell, a childhood friend who is now a top executive at Jay Z\u2019s agency, Roc Nation, and third to Mr. Kleiman, who still represents Mr. Durant through Jay Z\u2019s Roc Nation Sports and is also working for him directly as his manager and partner in the Durant Company.The photo is a reminder to himself about real friendship, Mr. Durant said. His social world had shrunken since his controversial move.\u201cWhen you make it to the league, especially from where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s like everybody made it,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cI can remember times going to a club, I had 30 people with me. I\u2019m thinking to myself, this was never me. But if you\u2019ve never had the support outwardly like that, people showing you affection in your face, love in your face, even if it\u2019s fake, you try to grab that because it feels good for the moment.\u201cNow, it\u2019s us three.\u201dHe may be rounding the math a little bit. Mr. Durant may have called off his engagement with Monica Wright, a W.N.B.A. player, and dialed back the entourage, but he goes out often after games in San Francisco and is quickly making friends with the tech titans who populate Oracle Arena\u2019s version of celebrity row.In September, he celebrated his birthday at a lavish barbecue at the house of Ben Horowitz, the influential venture capitalist and business partner of Marc Andreessen. Two months later, he watched the election results at the home of Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services, along with Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, and Pharrell Williams.\u201cI think that\u2019s why a lot of athletes and entertainers work well with some of those guys, because for one, they all had humble beginnings,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cThey built something from the ground up, so they can relate to us.\u201dMinutes before he was ready to settle down for his 2 p.m. nap, Mr. Durant headed to the real sanctuary in his Oakland home, the recording studio.\u201cMan, why you all keep it so cold in here?\u201d he asked Raleigh Dunn, his recording engineer, while taking a seat in the corner. The lights turned low, Mr. Dunn prepared a sample of the Chi-Lites \u201cHave You Seen Her\u201d for Mr. Durant to lay rhymes over. While some might call Mr. Dunn a \u201cproducer,\u201d Mr. Durant has a different name for him: music therapist.\u201cI\u2019ve got so much stuff on my mind, quite honestly, it\u2019s kind of easy for me to say it all here,\u201d Mr. Durant said, looking almost monastic with his goateed face hidden in the hood of his sweatshirt. Music, he said, is \u201ca release. It keeps me in the moment. It takes my mind off this crazy world.\u201dBut at the moment, Mr. Durant would only say that latest rhymes were about \u201crelationship things, both with male friends, females, relationships that might have been broken on both sides.\u201dThat\u2019s the beauty of music. Once you put it down on tape, he said, all the nagging issues \u201care just out of my mind. I can move on to the next thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Anti-Globalist or Globe-Trotter, and a Mercantilist Age", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump the president is an anti-globalist.Donald J. Trump the businessman, on the other hand, is more of a globe-trotter.Mr. Trump\u2019s organization continued to file applications for new trademarks around the world during the presidential campaign. One of his companies applied for trademark protection in the Philippines more than a month after the election.Mr. Trump has also taken out a European trademark for \u201cNumquam Concedere,\u201d Latin for \u201cNever Give Up,\u201d which is part of the crest at one of his Scottish golf courses.Documents released by the Department of Homeland Security showed the scope of the president\u2019s ambitions: to publicize crimes by undocumented immigrants; to strip such immigrants of privacy protections; to enlist local police officers as enforcers; to erect new detention facilities; to discourage asylum seekers; and, ultimately, to speed up deportations.As a new age of mercantilism has emerged alongside Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, one deal that could have been a triumph of global capitalism has faded away.Unilever is one of the biggest companies on the London stock market and Kraft\u2019s acquisition of the confectionery maker Cadbury in 2010 was not well received in Britain.And in the Netherlands, where a nationalist party is leading the polls, a takeover effort would have come under harsh scrutiny, especially given Kraft Heinz\u2019s reputation as a ferocious cost-cutter.Kraft Heinz probably realized it could never navigate the politics \u2014 a hostile takeover effort would have required a scorched-earth campaign that would have damaged its brand.But the encounter nevertheless serves as a warning for international deals to come.Giant corporations will find it harder to stretch across borders, and countries might well find themselves protecting inefficient national champions.These days, even those who work on deals can be part of deals.Rumors had swirled recently that Chadbourne was looking to merge after the departure of some partners.The firm was also sued by a female partner who accused it of routinely paying female partners less than their male counterparts and of keeping women out of leadership positions.The legal industry has been consolidating apace, especially as demand for legal services has become sluggish. There have been more than 80 deals involving law firms each year for the past four years.Advertisement"}
