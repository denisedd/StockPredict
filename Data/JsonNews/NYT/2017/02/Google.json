LEDs? No again. Possible, he said, but expensive.Opening on Saturday, the exhibition is meant to intrigue the minds and engage the senses of both grown-ups and children ( 6 and older only.) Through March 12, interactive installations and immersive technology will sprawl across three floors of BAM Fisher, including a studio dedicated to virtual reality with activities (like trying out Google Tilt Brush, the 3-D painting tool) and short films.Recently, some artists exhibiting in Teknopolis spoke about their work.The company, last seen at the academy two years ago with \u201cHakanai\u0308,\u201d a dance piece performed in a digital cube, will invite visitors to touch, walk on, dance with and sometimes just stand back and ponder its works arrayed in the Fishman Space.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do images that remain inside a screen,\u201d Ms. Bardainne said from France. \u201cWe want to turn images into environment. We want to turn them into living partners to play with, relating and reacting in a sensitive way to the body. That\u2019s why we always try to do immersive and interactive artwork \u2014 so you forget that you are in front of images.\u201d\u201cWhen I finished it, it was a rainy night,\u201d Mr. Soto said cheerfully from Hartford.Made from Plexiglas, sensors, wood and other materials, \u201cExp.Inst.Rain\u201d responds to touch with sound and colored light. A lover of electronic music, Mr. Soto wanted to create an instrument that would allow people to play it easily, whether or not they had any musical expertise.Technology, like visual art, used to be a more passive experience for the public, he said. Now that it is so hands-on, he added, \u201cwe have to make changes in the way the patrons can interact with the artwork.\u201d\u201cBoth my partner and I, dancing is not really our strong suit,\u201d Ms. Angelopoulos said from Toronto, where they collaborate under the name Catshrine. \u201cBut we\u2019re really good at animating, so we thought, hey, let\u2019s use those skills and make a machine that makes us look like really good dancers.\u201dThe process, she said, is less like dancing than like doing \u201cdance yoga\u201d: A participant strikes a series of dance poses. The machine takes pictures of those poses, then stitches them together in under five minutes to make an animated dance loop featuring the person\u2019s silhouette. \u201cThey have become dancers in stop motion,\u201d she said.Though there is an interactive element to \u201cLumarca,\u201d trying to grab it would be a terrible idea. It is not made of light suspended in air, but rather light projected on hundreds of precisely arranged strings, which in this case will be suspended at balcony level in the Fishman Space.Sometimes people feel cheated, Mr. Parker said, when they find out that the piece\u2019s technology is as simple as that: \u201cAll you need is math and projection and string, and all of those things have been available for quite some time now.\u201dTo him, though, that is part of the appeal: that you don\u2019t need a virtual-reality headset to look at the work and experience wonder.\u201cWhat I like about this project is that you don\u2019t have that filter in front of you,\u201d said Mr. Parker, who made \u201cLumarca\u201d with Josh Holtsford. \u201cYou\u2019re using your actual eyes.

{"Headline": "IBM Gives Watson a New Challenge: Your Tax Return", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its first steps toward commercialization, IBM\u2019s Watson took on grand, science-laden challenges like helping doctors diagnose cancer. But that is changing as IBM strives to build its artificial intelligence technology into a multibillion-dollar business.Today, companies including Geico, Staples and Macy\u2019s are adding the Watson technology to answer customer questions or to improve mobile apps that guide shoppers through stores.Now in its broadest deployment so far, Watson will be assisting H&R Block\u2019s 70,000 tax professionals this filing season at 10,000 branch offices across the country, where 11 million people file taxes.The H&R Block partnership with Watson, announced on Wednesday, is being presented to a wider audience with a 60-second television ad during the Super Bowl on Sunday.For IBM, the collaboration with H&R Block underlines its strategy in the emerging market for artificial intelligence technology. Watson will touch consumers, but through IBM\u2019s corporate clients.\u201cWatson will become a really smart, virtual assistant,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president of IBM\u2019s Watson business.The embedded-in-business formula is different from the path other technology companies are taking with digital assistants powered by artificial intelligence. Others are pursuing the broad consumer market directly with artificial intelligence software helpers like Siri from Apple, Cortana from Microsoft, Alexa from Amazon and Assistant from Google.In the corporate technology market, the major companies are racing to get on the artificial intelligence bandwagon, though they lack the early lead and powerful branding of Watson.Data-fueled artificial intelligence will be an ingredient in all kinds of software used in corporations, to streamline work, identify new customers, spot savings and guide product development, analysts say. By 2018, the research company IDC predicts that 75 percent of new business software will include artificial intelligence features.\u201cA.I. is becoming part of the mix, part of the infrastructure in consumer and business applications,\u201d said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.IBM is also banking on Watson as an engine of its corporate transformation. The company needs its new businesses like Watson, data analysis and cloud computing to more than make up for the erosion in its traditional hardware and software products.That has not happened yet. Two weeks ago, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarter of declining revenue.But there were encouraging signs in the last quarter of 2016.IBM executives noted that the company\u2019s newer businesses, including Watson, grew by 14 percent to represent 41 percent of total revenue. That was ahead of IBM\u2019s previous forecast that the 40 percent of revenue threshold would not be reached until 2018.But when Bill Cobb, chief executive of H&R Block, contacted IBM last summer, saying he wanted to use Watson to help \u201creinvent the retail experience for taxpayers,\u201d he heard what he called a candid assessment, not a sales pitch.\u201cThis is not magic,\u201d Mr. Cobb said the Watson team told him. \u201cYou have to teach Watson over time.\u201dWatson proved to be a quick learner. Its core skill is its ability to digest and classify vast amounts of text, using what is known as natural language processing. So, among other things, it was fed the 74,000 pages of the federal tax code and thousands of tax-related questions culled from H&R Block\u2019s data, accumulated over six decades of preparing tax returns.Then, H&R Block tax professionals were brought in to \u201ctrain\u201d Watson. They approved when Watson suggested a smart question for a particular tax filer and corrected it when a proposed question was off base. The tax professionals were not told they were working with Watson, just a software program.The technology was tested in about 100 H&R Block offices in January, and it will be available throughout the company\u2019s retail network next week. One goal, Mr. Cobb said, is to assist H&R Block\u2019s tax professionals and improve their chances of fairly increasing refunds and reducing tax liabilities for clients. Seventy-five percent of Americans who file taxes get money back. For H&R Block clients, the figure is about 85 percent, Mr. Cobb said.But Watson\u2019s other task was to make visiting H&R Block a more \u201cengaging and interactive\u201d experience, he said. Clients will be able to watch suggestions and questions on a separate screen, as the Watson-assisted tax professional works.Mr. Cobb said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with Watson\u2019s performance in the 100-office trial. But the test will come after this tax season, when H&R Block sees what percentage of customers return next year.The retention rate is crucial in the tax-preparation business. Sixty percent of the 140 million Americans who file taxes seek help instead of doing them themselves. Kartik Mehta, an analyst at Northcoast Research, estimates that H&R Block\u2019s retention rate is 75 percent. \u201cIf they can get that 75 percent up to 80 percent, it\u2019s a big deal for H&R Block,\u201d Mr. Mehta said.The Watson collaboration is a \u201clong-term partnership,\u201d Mr. Cobb said. Mr. Kenny of IBM described this tax season as \u201cphase one\u201d of the partnership.Over time, Watson\u2019s suggestions get better and better, more individually tailored to specific occupations, household finances and personal circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s crawl, walk, run learning,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cBut the pace of the Watson learning is so much faster than humans.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Automakers Step Up to Silicon Valley Challenge", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWOLFSBURG, Germany \u2014 One of the first things Ole Harms did after taking over Volkswagen\u2019s new ride-hailing start-up was leave town.Staid Wolfsburg, Volkswagen\u2019s home, was not the best place for the automaker to mount a defense against Silicon Valley challengers keen to upend the car industry, and he needed to move.\u201cNobody knows how the world is going to look\u201d in the coming years, said Mr. Harms, a bearded 41-year-old dressed in a gray cardigan over a crisply pressed white shirt. \u201cThe biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change.\u201dAt stake is the fate of the German economy, Europe\u2019s largest, at a time when the region is only beginning to emerge from a decade-long economic malaise. Germany, in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.Industry executives here often cite how Apple\u2019s iPhone quickly erased Nokia\u2019s once-dominant position in the mobile handset market, and they are determined not to let something similar happen to them.\u201cI am convinced that we are going to see more change in the next 10 or 15 years than we have seen in the last 100 years,\u201d Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the BMW management board, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe big question is always, Do we car manufacturers learn to become tech companies more quickly than a tech company learns to be an automotive player?\u201dBy contrast, Germany\u2019s automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach.To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon fiber body.Daimler also owns Car2Go, a short-term car rental service; Blacklane, an upmarket ride-hailing app; and MyTaxi, Europe\u2019s largest taxi-hailing service.Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, said the automaker\u2019s backing had allowed it to expand rapidly across Europe, where it has often teamed up with local taxi associations to combat the rise of Uber.\u201cThis is a game that requires deep pockets,\u201d Mr. Pinnington said.The German carmakers\u2019 digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals.\u201cThe future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together,\u201d said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm.Taken together, the carmakers\u2019 digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germany\u2019s vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States.But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology.The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germany\u2019s historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world.That is where Mr. Harms comes in.A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks.MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Mr. Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations.\u201cThe whole mobility market \u2014 transportation as a service \u2014 is just at the beginning,\u201d Mr. Harms said.Under Mr. M\u00fcller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least two million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service available in cities including New York and London.But for Mr. Harms, the carmakers\u2019 best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry \u2014 and other traditional sectors \u2014 to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful.\u201cA vehicle is extremely sensitive. You can\u2019t put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the ones who already know how to do it very well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the World\u2019s Wealthiest Invest Their Billions", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBernard Arnault, 67, is the richest man in France. Trained as a civil engineer, he got his start in business from his father, who had a successful construction company. He shifted the focus of his father\u2019s company to real estate and then turned his eye to luxury goods. Through his Groupe Arnault, the silver-haired Parisian sits at the helm of the luxury goods companies Christian Dior and LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. He is also a major art collector, having acquired works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol.His vast wealth sits predominantly in companies he controls. He has $34.8 billion held among Christian Dior, LVMH and Carrefour, a French retail chain. The next largest distribution is in cash at $2.9 billion; this is money from salaries, dividends and holdings that give him liquidity when he needs it. Then come the homes. He has a mansion in Paris worth $55 million and a home in the Bahamas worth $30 million, as well as yachts and art. His wealth shows how a single concentrated position in a company can increase your worth tremendously.Steven A. Ballmer, 60, scored a perfect 800 on the mathematics portion of the SAT and punched his ticket from an elite private school in Detroit to Harvard University. In his sophomore year, he lived in the same dorm as Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft. In 1980, he dropped out of Stanford University\u2019s business school to start working for Mr. Gates. He was paid $50,000 but given a stake in the nascent company. He rose to become chief executive in 2000 \u2014 a post he held for nearly 14 years. Shortly after stepping down, he bought the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team for a record $2 billion. The team had been mired in controversy with a previous owner, Donald Sterling.Even though Mr. Ballmer left Microsoft, the vast bulk of his wealth remains in company stock \u2014 $21.4 billion. He has $7.3 billion more in cash. It makes his stake in the Clippers seems paltry. He also has $450 million in Twitter shares. He owns a $14 million home in Hunts Point, Wash., and properties on Whidbey Island worth about $4 million.Susanne Klatten, 54, the richest woman in Germany, can trace the source of her wealth to \u201cthe ultimate driving machine,\u201d BMW. Her grandfather founded an industrial conglomerate that owned the German automotive company \u2014 and had a stake in its more staid rival, Daimler-Benz. The company also owned the chemical giant Altana. Her father, Herbert Quandt, took over the family businesses when his father died in 1954. When he died in 1982, Ms. Klatten received stakes in BMW and Altana, of which she is now the sole owner. As her father was credited with saving BMW from bankruptcy, she is credited with making Altana a top company in Germany. She is also chairwoman of the SGL Group, which produces graphite and carbon-fiber products.Her wealth is tied up in her companies, with over half, or $12.1 billion, in the BMW Group. An additional 16 percent is in Altana, and 1 percent is in the SGL Group. She has 22.5 percent in cash. She has a family office that creates privacy around the breakdown of her wealth.Azim Premji, 71, was born into the family that started Western India Vegetable Products, which produced hydrogenated oils. When Mr. Premji was at Stanford University, his father, who started the company, died, and he left college to take it over. At 23, he became chief executive. He diversified the Mumbai-based company\u2019s offerings into soap and baby care products. In 1981, he ventured into information technology. The company boomed through the 1980s and \u201990s, and in 2000 the renamed Wipro went public in New York. In 2009, Mr. Premji handed over the day-to-day running of the company. He devotes time to philanthropy, having given half his Wipro shares to a charity that supports education and health causes in India.His wealth appears to remain fairly concentrated, with 64 percent of it in Wipro shares. An additional 13 percent is in a related company, Wipro Enterprises, and 20 percent is shielded by his family office. Public records show that he has a $20 million stake in JM Financial (about 0.2 percent of his wealth), $180 million in cash and $1 million in property in Mumbai. Given his total worth, his properties and holdings are probably much greater, but he has structured his wealth to protect his privacy.Carlos Alberto Sicupira, who turns 69 this year, hails from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, which ranks just behind New York City (where he keeps a residence) for the most billionaires in the Americas. He began his career in finance at Banco de Investimentos Garantia. He later served as chief executive of Lojas Americanas, a Brazilian shopping chain. He is a founder of 3G Capital, a private equity firm that has become known in recent years for partnering with Warren E. Buffett, the second-wealthiest man in the world, on deals like the acquisition of Heinz in 2013 and, two years later, its merger with Kraft.Much of Mr. Sicupira\u2019s wealth rests in a series of deals 3G did with breweries starting in 1999. He has a $5.8 billion stake in the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev, which accounts for nearly 67 percent of his wealth. He has nearly $1 billion more in 3G itself. He still holds a $220 million stake in Lojas Americanas, where he remains chairman. He has an additional $1.6 billion in cash and a $2.5 million apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.Shari Arison, 59, was born in New York but splits her time now between Tel Aviv and Miami. Her father, Ted Arison, started Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. In 1990, he moved back to Tel Aviv, where he was born, and established Arison Investments. It later acquired Bank Hapoalim, Israel\u2019s largest bank, and renamed itself the Arison Group. It has investments in finance, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and water. When her father died in 1999, Ms. Arison inherited 35 percent of his wealth. (She has a brother, Micky, who owns the Miami Heat basketball team.) As owner of the Arison Group and a philanthropist, she promotes good deeds. The investment group\u2019s motto is \u201cDoing good is good for business,\u201d and through her charity she has sponsored Good Deeds Day, which encourages people to volunteer.Ms. Arison\u2019s wealth is divided fairly evenly among different investments. She owns $1.6 billion of stock in Carnival Cruise Line, $1.6 billion of stock in Bank Hapoalim, $1.1 billion in the Arison Group itself and holds $1 billion in cash. She has a stake in an Israeli housing and infrastructure company and homes in the Bal Harbour section of Miami and in Tel Aviv.Ever worn Nike, Adidas, Puma or Uniqlo? Those items may have come from one of Ma Jianrong\u2019s factories. His company is the leading textile manufacturer in China. Mr. Ma, 52, began working in the textile industry as a teenager and later earned a master\u2019s degree from Zhejiang University of Technology. His father, Ma Baoxing, was chairman of the weaving company that became Shenzhou International Group Holdings. In the late 1990s, the younger Mr. Ma took over the company and increased its revenue and net profit by 23 times in seven years. A member of the Chinese Communist Party, he is an official in the Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Congress.The exact composition of his wealth is hard to determine. He seems to have about $340 million in cash, with the rest in Shenzhou International Group Holdings.Patrice Motsepe, 55, was born in Johannesburg and began his career as a lawyer with American firms in South Africa. He attended university and law school during the apartheid era and practiced law for six years, becoming the first black partner in a South African law firm. In 1994, after Nelson Mandela became the country\u2019s first black president, Mr. Motsepe quit law to start Future Mining, a mining services company. With that as his start, he began acquiring mines and other mining companies. By 2004, the accumulated entities became African Rainbow Minerals. He owns the Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club, a soccer team in South Africa\u2019s premier league, and last year he started a private equity firm and financial services company.His wealth, which places him among South Africa\u2019s richest people, is well diversified. The largest portion of his wealth, 36 percent, is in cash and its equivalents. He has nearly 30 percent in Africa Rainbow Minerals, and a similar amount in Sanlam, a financial services firm of which he is deputy chairman. Some 5 percent of his wealth is in the Harmony Gold Mining Company. Two homes are worth $7 million, or one-third of 1 percent of his wealth.In search of quick Chinese food? Panda Express, with its 1,900 locations around the United States, is there to serve some up. Peggy Cherng, 69, founded the chain with her husband, Andrew. When the restaurant began expanding from Glendale, Calif., into the full-fledged chain it is today, she used her science background to make the business tech-savvy early on and then applied her knowledge of logistics to streamline the process. Ms. Cherng, who was born in Myanmar (then Burma), was raised in Hong Kong and met her husband at Baker University in Kansas. She holds a master\u2019s degree in computer science and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, and began her career at the defense contractor McDonnell Douglas. She and her husband live in California.Her largest holding is in the Panda Restaurant Group, which also owns Panda Inn. It is worth $1.2 billion, or 77 percent of her wealth. Nearly 19 percent of her wealth is in cash. She also has a large position, some $60 million, in the Golden Eagle Retail Group, a real estate development company. The rest of her wealth is in three homes in California.Smile, you\u2019re a billionaire. Kevin Systrom, 33, is a founder of the photo-sharing site Instagram, on which Beyonc\u00e9 announced her latest pregnancy and set a record for most shares. Mr. Systrom went to Stanford University and, after graduating in 2006, put in time at Google before venturing out on his own. In 2010, he and a friend got the idea for Instagram. Two years later, the company was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stock. He owned 40 percent of the company. He remains the chief executive.Mr. Systrom\u2019s wealth is tied to Facebook \u2014 at 88 percent. But he has about $160 million in cash. He also has $600,000 in Walmart stock from his role as a director of the company and the chairman of its technology and e-commerce committee.An article last Sunday about the investments of many of the world\u2019s billionaires misstated the name of the town in which Steven A.

She has also navigated through difficult days with support from Mend\u2019s Facebook group.It \u201creally helped normalize the experience,\u201d Ms. Dugan said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m even recommending it to some of my patients going through things like divorce.\u201dIn her Santa Monica, Calif., office, just blocks from the Pacific, Ms. Huerta, 30, with a tumble of dark hair and giant blue eyes, admitted that she had always been drawn to matters of the heart. \u201cMend started very organically after I went through a breakup,\u201d she said between sips of her hand-blended rooibos tea. \u201cI had a lot of resources at my disposal \u2014 I had supportive friends and access to therapy \u2014 but I still was having such a hard time moving forward.\u201dMs. Huerta, identified by the name Elle on Mend, found online sites that offer breakup advice to be disappointing, with generic insights like \u201cIt just takes time\u201d or wearisome directives like \u201cPost a photo on social media of yourself with someone new.\u201dShe said she set out to build a better digital experience for the newly solo, where users could shake their feeling of helplessness and take action. As a former Google employee, she was familiar with the tech field and took her cues from fitness and brain-health apps. \u201cWe are taking those parts of our lives very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cYet we weren\u2019t doing that with our love lives, which is at the core of who we are.\u201d\u201cOne of my personal missions is to erase the shame and taboo of heartbreak as something to just get over,\u201d Ms. Huerta said. One way she addresses that is by drawing on her background in science. (She has a degree in geosciences from Wellesley, and her father is a geophysicist.) She counsels the Mend community that it\u2019s not just emotion that causes a wave of intense feelings, it\u2019s also biology.\u201cIt\u2019s different for everyone,\u201d Ms. Huerta said, \u201cbut when you go through a separation with someone who you have been intimate with, your body can tell that there\u2019s been a separation. You\u2019re giving off hormones, and they are giving off hormones, over time you become addicted to that source of feel-good hormones.\u201dAlthough much of Ms. Huerta\u2019s advice for Mend users is grounded either in science or in her own romantic mistrials, and she encourages a range of options, like meditation and mood-boosting teas, she firmly believes in the magic and mystery of love, which no data, chart or study can pinpoint. It is that belief that will inform a Mend app update scheduled to roll out in the spring.One sentiment remains: \u201cIt\u2019s true what they say,\u201d Ms. Huerta said. \u201cLove really is the drug.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Look Now, but the Great Unbundling Has Spun Into Reverse", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe internet promised to be the great unbundler. The evisceration of distribution costs would free consumers from paying for cable television channels they never watched, allowing them to bypass cable monopolies and pay only for the shows they wanted. No longer would anyone have to buy a $99-a-month triple-play package when all they wanted was the History Channel.Over the last two decades, consumers have felt liberated as traditional bundles unraveled \u2014 from music to media to retail.For instance, Craigslist and myriad other digital start-ups siphoned lucrative job and real estate listings from traditional newspaper bundles. Meanwhile, media firms held onto the economically challenged business of delivering news and entertainment.Proponents of the breakdown of the bundle economy most often cite cable television. Superficially, the evidence is compelling: In the last six years, pay TV penetration has declined from about 90 percent to 80 percent of homes \u2014 with more than two million homes cutting the cord in the last couple of years alone.But paradoxically, the same forces that allowed classified ads and news to be so easily separated also drastically increased the economic rationale for bundling across the board.Consumers merely have swapped one bundle for another (or often, several). There are more than 65 million subscribers to cheaper \u201cover the top\u201d packages provided by Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Sling TV and others (even excluding Amazon Prime Video). One does not always think of all of these as \u201cbundles\u201d because these services do not consistently categorize their content using the commonplace TV channel taxonomy. However, their aggregation of shows looks more and more like a traditional cable bundle.We are in the age of the great rebundling, when firms use packages of services as a way to increase their scale advantage and thus deepen the moat around their businesses.In music, the story is even starker than in television. At one time, consumers used to buy a collection of songs \u2014 on vinyl, cassette and then compact disc. It was possible to buy a single song or two in these formats, but the internet facilitated more and more people downloading individual tracks.Yet, today, there is an inexorable consumer shift to all-you-can-eat bundles of music. Already more than 60 million people pay for Spotify, Apple Music and others. These music bundles will increasingly be combined with other services as well to build competitive advantage. This newspaper currently includes Spotify with certain new subscriptions. And it is easy to see how Google and Apple will increasingly integrate music packages into their broader suite of services (as Amazon already has).Bundling has always worked well for products for which consumers have widely varying tastes and willingness to pay. The magic of bundle economics allows consumers to get more for less, while also maximizing revenue for the provider. Imagine that there are two hungry diners at a burger joint where the restaurant\u2019s marginal cost of food is zero-ish. One customer is willing to fork over $5 for a burger and $1 for fries. The other will shell out $5 for fries but only $1 for a burger. By selling a la carte, the restaurant maximizes revenue by pricing each item at $5. Both consumers leave hungry, and the business takes in $10. However, both diners would snap up a $6 bundle, allowing them to sate their appetites while shelling out $12 in total. Everyone is better off (perhaps not healthwise).In the digital environment, two additional forces are driving this tidal wave of digital bundling.First, the near-zero marginal cost of distribution makes all-you-can-eat packages compelling. Even heavy users of streaming services can potentially be profitable customers if the underlying economics of rights payments are well managed.The Federal Communications Commission appears to be relaxing its position on the bundling of data and services. The agency had been investigating the practice of \u201czero-rating,\u201d whereby a wireless carrier like T-Mobile allows its subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data cap. Recently, the F.C.C. dropped this investigation \u2014 believing that this kind of bundling is now commonplace in a competitive market. Plainly this is the thin edge of the wedge for net neutrality. Connectivity and cloud computing services will most likely start to include \u201cunrated\u201d services to differentiate themselves further from other commodity providers. In the short term, this shift will most likely be a boon for consumers. Time will tell whether this stifles long-range innovation \u2014 especially in bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming.Second, firms need to mitigate the high cost of attracting and retaining online consumers. Netflix can amortize the expense of acquiring and servicing a subscriber over the hundreds of dollars of revenue they will generate if they hang around for a couple of years. Selling individual shows for a few bucks a pop would be vastly more expensive in marketing, billing and service costs.Tying several services together (even when they are not all directly complementary) increases customer loyalty. Amazon Prime has more than 66 million subscribers. Just a few years ago, it was mostly a free-shipping service. Now, it includes an extensive library of free e-books, videos and music. The large base of Prime subscribers makes life hard for would-be Amazon competitors \u2014 who have to contend not just with Amazon\u2019s scale in any particular vertical but also the combined value of the eclectic products and services that Amazon bundles together. This value may also increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning help personalize these applications. Walmart may be four times larger than Amazon in retail, but Amazon\u2019s bundle magnifies the impact of its size, reducing its scale disadvantage.For insurgents, this trend complicates the already formidable challenge of competing with the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple \u2014 all of which have been adept at weaving various interconnected services together to magnify their scale advantage.Technology investors are obsessed with network effects. These help make firms like Facebook and eBay so valuable \u2014 because additional users increase utility for everyone, making it hard for upstarts to compete. But investors often forget that network effects are just a subset of scale advantages. Superior scale is what protects most businesses from competition. It would be hard to start a business to take on Coca-Cola because of its size advantage \u2014 especially in local bottling, distribution and marketing.During the road show for the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape, its chief executive, Jim Barksdale, famously commented that there are \u201conly two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.\u201d For many firms, the bundle is not a decaying symbol of legacy distribution. Rather, it is the new network effect: a critical strategy to amplify scale in the hope of building or deepening a moat to protect against foes everywhere.Jeremy G.

{"Headline": "Monumental Work", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayTHURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 We have another debut today, and I\u2019m just letting you know up front that its clever theme calls for a specific sort of knowledge.Not to worry: It deals with some basic differences between British and American English, which is the sort of knowledge most of you already possess. Also, as someone who recently spent approximately one week in London for the first time, I consider myself an expert. So really, ask me anything.The first thing you might note after you solve is that the placement of the theme entries is geographically incorrect. Or maybe it didn\u2019t bother you, but as the person who is responsible for pointing out things like this, I asked the constructor Ross Trudeau in the gentlest way possible \u2014 because this is his first published puzzle and I didn\u2019t want to upset him \u2014 why the Britishisms were on the \u201cwest\u201d side of the ATLANTIC OCEAN and the American English was on the \u201ceast\u201d side. Here, verbatim, is his response:The truth is that I just couldn\u2019t get the fill to work with the Britishisms in the east where they belong. But here is my in-progress list of alternative excuses:1. My roommate, the inspiration for the puzzle, now speaks his British English here on the left of the Atlantic.2. The U.S. is on the \u2018left\u2019 of the Atlantic, only because world maps arbitrarily represent north as up, which is a shameful vestige of Eurocentric cartography that thought it only proper to place Europe \u2018on top.\u2019 #staywokeSo, at least now we know what we\u2019re dealing with. Feel free to turn the puzzle upside down if it makes you feel better.I have gone on record as someone who is not fond of puzzles where the theme relies on cross-referencing (\u201cX-Down, across the Y-Down\u201d) because it requires too much bopping around the grid, and so I was somewhat disheartened when I scanned the clue list. As I got into the puzzle and it started to flow, however, I became a fan. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s theme hides itself for a long time, and that\u2019s always a delicious treat on a Thursday.Now you all get back to work and, Bob\u2019s your uncle, you\u2019ll be done in no time.\u25a0 1A: Wordplay alert! \u201cBit of resistance\u201d can have different meanings, but today it refers to the OHM, the measure of resistance.\u25a0 7A: I was doomed on this one from the start, but apparently the New England Patriots, who won the Super Bowl on Sunday, were AFLERS (members of the American Football League) before 1970.

I haven\u2019t met too many clowns named BOBO.I wrote this puzzle, along with the first 20 or so that I sent out for consideration to puzzle editors, by hand. It was during the editorial process that I learned that constructors tend to use software to help with fill. The exchange went something like:After a semi-concussive face-palm, I chose to look back on my countless pencil-and-paper hours as a rite of passage. And I especially dig that BREXIT found a home in the fill. It is my great privilege to be able to honor my best mate \u2014 an immigrant and a good man \u2014 in these fraught days.And we welcome you, Mr. Trudeau.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

And as a descendant of slaves, I know that America has been challenged throughout history to deliver on its promise of freedom for all, but has also been slowly moving toward justice for all.We have to resist the urge to roll over and go with the flow. We have to resist the want to normalize what has happened over the last year and resist the tendency to take our eye off of the ball of the issues. It is so easy to just subscribe to the notion that \u201cthis is the world we live in,\u201d but the resistance demands we challenge that. The resistance demands that we stand up for what we know is right and true, not because it is popular, but because it is necessary.For me, to resist means resisting the temptation to assume, to decide who a person is before spending time with him or her. Resist writing other people\u2019s stories for them. Resist the urge to hide, to click over to something else when that difficult truth pops up on your screen. Resist the opportunity to just keep walking, to avoid eye contact.

So to me it\u2019s making sure we are protecting what we have gained and pushing the envelope further and working to engage more people in the processOne of the things that resistance means to me is not buying into Donald Trump\u2019s ridiculous and wrong vision of America as only a place of carnage and understanding that we need to resist his description of what we are and know that it is the diversity of our country that has made us a strong and prosperous nation and not the opposite.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s been years since a big American consumer tech company went public, so everyone on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley has been salivating over Snap\u2019s debut on the market. And what we learned can be boiled down to two sentences: Snap is making a whole lot of money. And it\u2019s losing even more.Another interesting data point was the size of its user base. Snapchat has about 160 million daily users. That\u2019s not small! But it\u2019s not that big, either, compared to Facebook and Instagram. It\u2019s more in line with Twitter, which is not doing all that well.Here\u2019s Snap\u2019s problem. Part of what made companies like Facebook so successful is this economic term and Silicon Valley buzzphrase: network effects. Essentially, the larger a network gets, the more people tend to find value in it. Facebook is the classic example of positive network effects strengthening the site over time.Snapchat has a bit more difficult time doing that. It doesn\u2019t have a follower model similar to Facebook\u2019s, which means it takes a bit more effort to find new or interesting people to interact with on Snapchat. Also, content posted by people who aren\u2019t your friends isn\u2019t easily discoverable, another issue of keeping people engaged, in my mind.A lot of folks compare Snapchat to Twitter, which I think is a pretty apt way of looking at it. Both companies really rely on brand advertising \u2014 basically, high-dollar accounts from huge advertisers rather than a bunch of smaller accounts that make up the long tail of revenue \u2014 and that seems to pale in comparison to the advertisers that go with, say, Google or Facebook.And, as Facebook will tell you all day long, advertisers love targeting data, which Facebook has in droves. Snapchat, less so.This is moving much faster than I thought it would. I\u2019m not surprised Silicon Valley is a liberal bastion; I am surprised that workers here reacted so strongly to the new order. Were you? And where do you think this goes?And to your earlier point, the speed of how people mobilized so quickly was indeed breathtaking. I think a lot of it had to do with a feeling of helplessness among people that I heard about quite a bit. They wanted to do something, hence the protests, but also deleting and boycotting Uber felt satisfying to many, like they were taking a stand. We\u2019ll see if that blows over now that Travis is off the council.If that\u2019s not towering hypocrisy, I don\u2019t know what is.Till next week?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg, Bucking Tide, Takes Public Stand Against Isolationism", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Thursday stepped into the raging debate about globalization.He pledged that he would push Facebook, which has more than 1.8 billion users worldwide, in a direction that would help convince individuals and governments that \u201cprogress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.\u201dThe letter comes close to a political statement by a chief executive who, as the leader of a global company, is essentially arguing against a tide of isolationism that is rising across the world.In an interview this week at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Mr. Zuckerberg said that when he started Facebook, \u201cthe idea of connecting the world was not controversial.\u201d\u201cThe default assumption was that the world was just incrementally moving in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s actually a real question.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg released his missive amid a fierce debate over the merits of globalization. In the United States, President Trump has displayed a deep streak of nationalism. Last year, Britain voted to quit the European Union. Those moves and others have been taken as signs of how globalization has caused strains \u2014 making it more difficult for companies to navigate a new world order.Mr. Zuckerberg said his reasons for writing the updated letter began to take shape before last year\u2019s presidential election, spurred by broader trends. He said he recognized that more people were feeling left behind by globalization, and by societal and technological changes. As a result, he wanted to focus different parts of Facebook in a way that helped people better come together.\u201cWe have to build a global community that works for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t have much doubt that this is the right direction to go in the long term.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said he planned to reorient Facebook, which turned 13 this month, around these new realities. His letter is filled with abstract ideas, including the notion of \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d and how to create stronger online communities, with few detailed steps about how to realize those goals.One top priority is building inclusive online communities that are supportive, safe and informed environments, to help strengthen bonds in the offline world as well. Mr. Zuckerberg also stressed the idea of using Facebook to create this \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d \u2014 essentially a digital means of connecting people around shared interests \u2014 mirroring social groups in the physical world like churches, governments and unions. That may encourage connections among people that transcend national and international barriers, he said.While Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned several concrete steps that Facebook has taken toward some of these goals, he gave few other specifics. He did not address how his vision might conflict with those of political leaders around the world, nor did he mention how emphasizing global connections benefited Facebook\u2019s finances.Getting to this point did not come easily. Since going public, Facebook has been on a growth tear, becoming one of the world\u2019s biggest and most valuable public entities.Facebook users disagreed, arguing that the photograph was not titillating but rather illustrated the perils of modern warfare. The social network eventually allowed the image to be posted on its site, noting that it had inherent news value.Mr. Zuckerberg said the episode made him realize how ineffective Facebook\u2019s content policy was at a global scale, given that cultural norms vary greatly by country. He said Facebook needed to get to a place in which users could perhaps choose their own content policies based on local laws and preferences, a marked departure from the company\u2019s blanket global approach of the past decade or more.\u201cI don\u2019t think that we, sitting here in California, are best positioned to know what the norms in communities around the world should be,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cAt some point, you just need a more dynamic system where people can just express that themselves.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg spent much of his letter focused on the importance of personal relationships. He pointed to \u201cvery meaningful groups\u201d \u2014 Facebook groups that people frequently engage in and return to \u2014 that are often centered on topics like parenting, sports or other shared interests. When people find an interest they are passionate about and form such a group, they are some of the most tightly connected relationships on Facebook, he said.To foster more of these groups in a safe way, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook needed to change some of the ways that it operated. That includes improving community safety with product updates similar to Facebook\u2019s \u201csafety check,\u201d a tool that lets people mark themselves safe during catastrophes. Mr. Zuckerberg said that governments regularly called Facebook to confirm that Safety Check was activated during crises like the massacre at a nightclub in Florida last year.Mr. Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook\u2019s role in keeping communities well-informed, which will necessitate tackling misinformation and highly polarized news. He alluded to Facebook\u2019s shifting role as a distributor of news, saying the social network is \u201cnot just technology or media.\u201dFacebook\u2019s goal, Mr. Zuckerberg said, was not to usurp traditional institutions like governments, religious groups and other communities that share interests. (When asked if he wanted to run for president of the United States, he laughed and declined.) Instead, he said, creating tightly knit online groups would make these traditional institutions stronger.It also would not hurt that such groups and connections could well make Facebook more essential to people, which in turn may increase the company\u2019s profits.\u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built to deal with modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cI just think it would be good if more people thought about things like this.\u201dAn article on Friday about an update to Facebook\u2019s mission statement misstated, in some copies, the location of a nightclub massacre last year. It was in Florida, not Paris. (A nightclub massacre in Paris occurred in 2015.)Advertisement"}

He has been called \u201cthe king of YouTube\u201d and countless variations thereon, and he has remained unchallenged on that perch for years, making millions of dollars and leveraging his popularity into outside ventures.It\u2019s tempting to write off this scandal as an inscrutable product of a teen subculture, wrapped up in layers of irony and the peculiar language and aesthetics of YouTube. It is likewise easy to frame the episode as an isolated collision between offensive speech and careful sponsors. But it\u2019s most useful to understand Kjellberg\u2019s meltdown in the context of the vast platform on which it took place \u2014 YouTube \u2014 and the nascent strains of politics that could come to define it.With more than a billion users, YouTube has become not merely a platform but almost a kind of internet nation-state: the host of a gigantic economy and a set of cultures governed by a new and novel sort of corporation, sometimes at arm\u2019s length and other times up close. It\u2019s a system Kjellberg has spent recent months antagonizing in a broader and less-inflammatory way, even as he continued to thrive within it. He bemoaned its structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube\u2019s very own populist reactionary.For product reviewers and gamers, for the unboxers and the how-to teachers, for the interchannel drama analysts, the bloggers, the makeup artists and the pranksters, YouTube looms large not just as a context but also as a character. The daily exigencies of life on YouTube are perhaps the only subject that cuts across every major YouTube category. Showbiz loves to make movies about showbiz, and television loves to make television about TV. YouTube has simply democratized this impulse.It makes sense that YouTube would become home to such a performatively self-aware economy. It is, after all, one of the most mature of the major social platforms. It is extremely culturally productive, and can claim genuine stars as its own. Above all, it pays. And in the people who depend on the platform to pay their bills, it inspires a peculiar mixture of paranoia, desire, gratefulness and disdain that shows up clearly in their work. YouTube\u2019s peculiar relationship with the economy within it is fraught, promising and poorly understood. It\u2019s also unique among social-media platforms \u2014 but maybe not for much longer. For now, most of the biggest internet platforms are understood as venues for communication, expression and consumption. YouTube has given us a glimpse at what happens when users start associating social platforms with something more: livelihoods.Watch enough YouTube programming on any subject and you\u2019ll gradually come to understand the struggles of starting and maintaining a channel. You\u2019ll become familiar with the mementos Google sends creators at subscriber milestones \u2014 a silver \u201cplay\u201d button at 100,000, around which time your favorite YouTubers might start talking about quitting their day jobs, and a gold one at a million, when they are more to likely have done so. You\u2019ll hear plenty about conversations with YouTube support, many of which contradict one another. You\u2019ll develop opinions about YouTube\u2019s copyright rules, age restrictions and advertising policies. You\u2019ll get an intuitive sense of the YouTube attention marketplace and how people try to take advantage of it, and you\u2019ll hear about advertising rates. You\u2019ll hear conspiracy theories \u2014 some rooted in daily shared YouTube experience, others rooted in less visible fears, desires and resentments \u2014 some of which gain considerable traction.And why shouldn\u2019t you? YouTubers are not employed by YouTube, but they are paid by YouTube, because it matches their videos, automatically, with advertisers. The platform and the video-makers share a clear and common goal: to persuade audiences to watch more videos in order to make more money from ads. But even with a unifying cause, creators inevitably discover smaller ways in which their goals and YouTube\u2019s are at odds. It is in YouTube creators\u2019 interest, for example, to understand the best practices for getting the most YouTube subscribers, or the best strategies for making videos that YouTube might algorithmically recommend. But it is in YouTube\u2019s interest for the inner workings of its platform \u2014 including recommendation algorithms, the way it calculates advertising rates and the precise locations of its boundaries \u2014 to remain at least somewhat secret, to prevent creators from gaming the platform\u2019s quirks at the expense of either YouTube\u2019s user experience or its bottom line. Criticism from its creators is one of the many things YouTube tolerates to maintain this arrangement, which is otherwise clearly working to their benefit.Emergent politics of social platforms differ in scope and character and sit along peculiar axes, some familiar, others new. On Twitter, which does not pay popular users, they revolve around matters of speech and harassment; the platform hosts a range of progressive movements as well as an extremely visible and openly racist reactionary movement, and they have been at war. On Facebook, which is bigger and less combative, they focus on censorship and governance. But on any major platform, they tend to grow from the same fertile place: the gap between the structures built by the company and what users are allowed to do within them. Inevitably, this leads users to fundamental political questions: Who gets what, and why? Who gets to do what, and why?Here, again, it is helpful to situate Kjellberg properly. He initially rose to popularity within the video-gaming subculture, which, beginning with the \u201cGamerGate\u201d movement and continuing through the American presidential election, became surprisingly and darkly politicized. His core audience is young, and his sensibility clearly appeals to a masculine teenage impulse to shock and provoke. The YouTube platform plainly incentivizes such attention-grabbing behavior, right up until the point that it becomes a liability to its operators or their other partners \u2014 a familiar dilemma in the entertainment world, sure, but one that plays out quite differently on YouTube, which is considerably and deliberately less hands-on with its talent. It\u2019s telling that YouTube\u2019s biggest star portrayed the platform as distant and capricious. It\u2019s alarming that following his performative hostility led him to where it did: attempting to rationalize the use of anti-Semitic speech under the guise of transgression.Maker Studios, which seeks to create a sort of auxiliary production apparatus for YouTube, has less of a connection to the platform than any of the YouTubers it has partnered with, who belong much more to their audiences, and to YouTube. Its severing of ties, in the bigger context of YouTube, amounts to a disavowal. YouTube\u2019s reaction, and how it follows up, is the thing to watch. As, of course, is Kjellberg\u2019s. His most recent video, posted after Maker Studios and Google made their announcements, was a lighthearted play-through of a gag video game called \u201cGenital Jousting,\u201d and did not reference the scandal. His commenters, on the other hand, did, asking almost uniformly that he not apologize for anything.The full character of the burgeoning politics of platforms remains to be seen. But right-wing movements have found early traction and see opportunity. Even as farce, Kjellberg\u2019s performance has been illustrative, and a small number of eager observers say they hope that, as backlash mounts, it will be galvanizing. \u201cIf Pewdiepie wasn\u2019t #AltRight before,\u201d Vox Day, a former video-game designer and an alt-right leader posted on Gab.ai, a private, Twitterlike service popular with the movement, \u201che is now.\u201dJohn Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Low-Tech Guide to Becoming More Politically Active", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 No matter which political party you belong to, one thing is clear: Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency has galvanized political activism to a level of passion not seen since the civil rights movement.Far less clear is what you can do in reaction to the Trump administration\u2019s changes.And in an era that promises instant gratification \u2014 like cars, couriers and food summoned to your driveway with the tap of a smartphone app \u2014 you might think tech is a quick and easy solution to becoming a political activist. But it turns out software and web tools can go only so far.At best, tech is an excellent resource for staying on top of political activities. But at some point, you will have to go outside or pick up the phone and engage with people, like fellow citizens and members of Congress.But what else can you do besides following news and events on Twitter and Facebook? What follows is a guide to some of the most useful resources and tools I uncovered after interviews with tech-skilled activists.The first challenge to getting more politically active is filtering out the torrent of political news to understand what you should care about.Another approach is following the legislation you care about. Mr. Tauberer\u2019s tool, GovTrack.us, lets you share your location, select an issue and view the bills that have been introduced.For example, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California introduced a bill to nullify the effect of the executive order on immigration. The site says there is a 7 percent chance of the bill being enacted. You could then contact Ms. Feinstein\u2019s office to say you support or oppose her bill.For example, if you live in Dallas and disagree with President Trump\u2019s nominations, the site instructs you to call Senator John Cornyn and say, \u201cHi, I\u2019m a resident of Dallas and I would like Senator Cornyn to vote against President Trump\u2019s nominations for his cabinet.\u201dYou will only get so far working alone. At some point, joining a group will help you coordinate broader actions like protests or coordinated phone calls.Where to find one? That will depend on your political beliefs: You will have to ask around or search social networks like Meetup.com, a site to find local events and people who share your interests.Some unique forms of activism can emerge from working with a team. Lea Yu, an organizer for Tech Workers Coalition, said she met fellow activists at a contest in December in which people were asked to make tech tools for political activism.\u201cA single, lonesome tweet doesn\u2019t get a consumer very far if they want a company to take a stand,\u201d Ms. Yu said. \u201cBut when hundreds of tweets are coordinated, you see companies like Visa and Uber becoming very responsive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Congratulations on the Oscar nomination. No matter what, that\u2019ll be ascribed to you from here on in.Hey, that\u2019s crazy. My heart races when you say that. That\u2019s insane. It still hasn\u2019t fully sunk in. It gets to me in waves.But you were projected to get a spot!I think that can be quite maddening. I want to make sure I remain grateful for the experience. It really did change me as a human being. To shift the focus to awards too quickly would be a real shame.How were you changed?First and foremost, I met Garth [Davis, the director], and made a friend of him. I\u2019ll be in his corner for life. He really has impacted the way I think in a big way, and made me embark on a journey of curiosity, and really challenged me.You had to fight for role, right?Yeah, [Mr. Davis thought] \u201cOh, he\u2019s the guy from \u2018Slumdog\u2019 \u2014 obvious choice\u201d \u2014 in this instance it worked against me. People just pigeonhole you in that role; they think you have nothing else to offer. He told me point blank he was looking for an actor who will dissolve into the role and be utterly believable. That just made me salivate. I got more excited. I just had to go into the audition room fighting a preconceived notion of myself, which is fine.For the part, you had to become bigger and hunkier. Does it feel different, occupying that new physicality?That was a definite order from Garth: Hit the gym and put on some weight. It was a really fun eight months of eating like a glutton, and having fun with this awesome trainer at a gym. More than anything it was about adopting a different physical presence on screen. I\u2019ve never known what it feels like to fill out a T-shirt and a pair of jeans, to walk around feeling bigger. All those nuances and strokes build a character. I enjoy going to the gym. It calms me down, and makes me feel a lot better. But as my trainer says, I\u2019m a bit of a Woody Allen in the gym.How so?I\u2019m just neurotic and all over the place, and kind of a comedy routine when I\u2019m training.What are you doing in India?I just finished production on this film called \u201cHotel Mumbai,\u201d about attacks at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel that happened in 2008 in Mumbai. It shocked the whole nation. It was horrific, horrific, what happened to so many innocent people. Indians, Brits, Americans. I play a young waiter from a poor background who works in the hotel when the terrorists come in.Is Sunny Pawar going to be your Oscars date?I think I only got one ticket, and that\u2019s reserved for mum. I can replace the handkerchief in my pocket with Sunny.Sunny\u2019s ridiculously cute. Do you think he helped lift your chances?Without a doubt. The audiences immediately invested in him. As soon as he comes onscreen, they\u2019re behind this small child surviving in a really, really, harsh, lonely terrifying environment. He\u2019s an impossible to act to follow.Who was cuter as a kid, Sunny or you?There\u2019s no competition \u2014 he\u2019s a pint-size little charmer. He\u2019s got the confidence of 10 men.Advertisement"}

But should it be?As the chart shows, the worst discrepancy is the San Francisco metropolitan area, where a standard house should cost about $300,000 \u2014 but in reality is more like $800,000 (based on 2013 figures). Next comes cities and counties in coastal Southern California \u2014 basically a band of overpriced housing that stretches downward from Ventura to the San Diego border.Inland cities like Sacramento, Fresno and Riverside are all much cheaper, which is why many Californians have moved eastward.Now, to remind you, these are metro area figures. So even if San Francisco, Los Angeles and their surrounding cities started a surge in building, that doesn\u2019t mean that homes in the most sought-after places like the Mission District or Santa Monica will ever be close to affordable.The research suggests the bigger problem with coastal California isn\u2019t that not enough people can afford to live exactly where they want \u2013 it\u2019s that not enough people can afford to live there at all.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Lowriding, rooted in Latino culture, emerged in Southern California in the 1940s and \u201950s as car customization became popular.Today, cars are commonly tricked out with flashy paint jobs, plush upholstery and hydraulics that make them wiggle and bounce.While out grabbing coffee in Los Angeles\u2019s Crenshaw neighborhood, Mr. Inong, 30, noticed a gathering of people and cars and went with his camera to get a closer look.When he approached, the man seen in the photo with the dollar sign tattoo asked him if he was a cop.\u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no,\u2019\u201d Mr. Inong said. \u201cAnd he told me, \u2018O.K.

{"Headline": "In a City That Walks, Choosing Amputation for a More Active Life", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne afternoon last summer, a team of prosthetic technicians hovered around Adam Taylor as if he were a racecar in for a pit stop.The length of Mr. Taylor\u2019s new right leg was off, so a technician rushed away to shorten it at a pipe cutter. An additional fabric liner was added to Mr. Taylor\u2019s residual limb. But it was too tight, so the additional liner was removed to allow better suction for the prosthesis. Another technician knelt on the floor, fiddling with the alignment of the new foot.When Mr. Taylor\u2019s leg was fitted and he had on a new pair of Nikes, Chris Kort, the owner of Prosthetics in Motion, based in Manhattan, pointed him to a wheelchair for the 60-foot trip to a parallel bar walkway.\u201cWhy can\u2019t we walk there?\u201d Mr. Taylor asked, with a mix of urgency and agitation.At the end of the five-hour appointment, Mr. Taylor, 36, walked out of the office on two legs, joining the ranks of thousands of New Yorkers who use artificial limbs to help them get around in a city that prides itself on walking and more walking.The sight of a high-tech carbon-fiber lower leg peeking out from a pair of shorts is increasingly common in New York. But what sets apart Mr. Taylor\u2019s situation is that the operation to remove his right leg below the knee was elective. Mr. Taylor chose to amputate to gain a more active life.For much of his life, Mr. Taylor struggled to walk. As a teenager, he had gaping wounds on his feet from a rare skin disease, linear scleroderma, constricting his right ankle with scar tissue. Several years ago, a wound appeared on his leg and never healed. Cancer developed. Last February doctors were confident surgery would remove the cancer, but when it did not, he was presented with two options: drastic reconstructive surgery or amputation.\u201cWe went from 5 miles an hour to 100 miles an hour overnight,\u201d he said, referring to the sudden need for a life-changing decision.Even though amputation seemed extreme, Mr. Taylor, a product manager at Verizon, committed to exploring it and reconstructive surgery.\u201cHow do you shower?\u201d Mr. Taylor recalled wondering. \u201cDo you have your prosthetic on all day? Do you sleep with it on? I really had no idea.\u201dA family friend heard about Mr. Taylor\u2019s dilemma and put him in touch with Alec Evedon, a young man in Florida who had decided on amputation after a motorcycle crash left him with 40 percent of the use of one foot.\u201cThat mentality that I would rather die than get an amputation quickly changed,\u201d Mr. Evedon, 22, said. He explained the nuances of his new life to Mr. Taylor: You shower using a chair; you wear your prosthesis all day; and no, you do not sleep with it on.He also insisted that Mr. Taylor meet with a prosthetist, comparing the intimate, continuing relationship they might have to one with a hairstylist or tattoo artist. Mr. Taylor, whose left arm is covered with tattoos, understood.Prosthetics in Motion appeared at the top of a Google search and what was planned as a quick visit turned into three hours. \u201cWe became part of his interview process,\u201d said Michael Lichter, 34, a prosthetic technician with the company. Like Mr. Taylor, he collects sneakers, favors flat-brim ball caps and rides a bike. He is also a below-the-knee amputee, the instant result of a car crash. (\u201cI had on a brand-new pair of Reebok Classics that I was really mad about,\u201d he said.) He spent the following months swamped in depression. After three years in a wheelchair, he got a prosthesis and learned to walk again.Mr. Taylor\u2019s choice came during a time when thoughts about how prostheses are worn and what they should look like were shifting, Mr. Lichter said, and that helped to normalize amputation. While many people opt for prostheses meant to look like limbs, the bionic look is becoming more common, especially among military veterans. Even a recent shoe campaign from the designer Kenneth Cole features an uncovered prosthetic leg of a model front and center.Drastic reconstructive surgery, or limb salvage, was Mr. Taylor\u2019s other option. Doctors offered differing opinions about how far into the muscle or bone the procedure should go. The only consensus was recovery time: six months of bed rest, provided the surgeon got all of the cancer and no infection developed.\u201cHe has suffered so much for so long \u2014 25 years \u2014 that we didn\u2019t want any more huge surgeries that were maybes,\u201d Mr. Taylor\u2019s wife, Christa, said.But Mr. Taylor felt pressured to choose reconstruction. He said one doctor, who could perform both operations, refused to even discuss amputation. Others cast shadows over amputee life that did not align with the positive and agile amputees he had met.Despite the fact that numerous studies show amputation and reconstruction result in similar function and life quality, amputation seems to be linked with failure, and some doctors have put their patients through hopeless operations to avoid it, said Dr. Daniel E. Prince, an orthopedic oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who performed Mr. Taylor\u2019s amputation.\u201cI think it comes from a little bit of the God complex in medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we can fix anything.\u201dMr. Taylor came to realize that he felt peaceful about amputation and uncertain about reconstruction. His constricted ankle, even before the cancer, meant walking 10 blocks was a challenge. Reconstruction might get the cancer, but it would not fix the walk.In the end, Mr. Taylor knew what to do after an M.R.I. revealed the cancer had spread, reducing the odds that reconstruction would be successful. With his decision made, the surgery could not come fast enough. Mr. Taylor, with a dose of morbid humor, took the first option available \u2014 a Friday the 13th last spring.The day of the operation arrived after a sleepless night, but Mr. Taylor said he felt a sense of celebration. For seven years he had spent two hours a day dressing his wounds. That morning he did not bother. As he left his apartment, he noted that he was walking down his last set of stairs on his two feet.Now \u2014 nine months after the amputation and five months after his prosthetic fitting \u2014 Mr. Taylor is back on two feet. To measure his progress, he recalls what his right foot had permitted him to do, which was not much. When a friend came to visit New York two years ago, it was Mrs. Taylor who walked around the city with him while Mr. Taylor stayed home. But when someone else came to visit a few weeks ago, Mr. Taylor walked more than two miles, four times the distance he had been limited to previously. Even Mr. Taylor\u2019s physical therapist\u2019s office, a few blocks from his Brooklyn apartment, is now a stroll away rather than a cab ride.\u201cThose things I don\u2019t think about anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI just put my leg on and walk and it is on until I go to bed. That\u2019s it.\u201dStairs to the subway are still a challenge. He describes each step down with his prosthetic leg as a slight free-fall rather than a controlled descent. But he waits for the rush of commuters to dissipate before he slowly makes his way down, relying on the handrail. At any rate, he said he was just glad to be taking the subway. The Taylors\u2019 monthly Uber bill has fallen significantly.While out with his three dogs recently after a snowstorm, Mr. Taylor walked with a noticeable limp but trod through old snow without a hitch. He had been practicing.\u201cIt was a little wobbly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I got used to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Adele turned it into the kind of crescendo of sorrow and desperation she does so well, then sang a final, pure phrase alone: \u201cI miss my baby.\u201d Clearly, she \u2014 like millions of fans \u2014 was missing Mr. Michael.JON PARELESJOE COSCARELLICARYN GANZJON PARELESHis turn as Prince in full Purple Rain regalia, from the purple sequin jacket to the black eyeliner, wasn\u2019t ribald, but it was amiable enough. But Bruno Mars truly shined earlier in the evening, during his solo performance of \u201cThat\u2019s What I Like,\u201d which was louche, smooth and anthemic. That he came out to the front of the stage to directly serenade Jennifer Lopez, in stunning harmony with his two backup singers, was slick. That he sang while wearing a leather tracksuit was practically wet.JON CARAMANICAJON CARAMANICACARYN GANZSometimes nostalgia is almost enough. The long-ballyhooed Grammy salute to Prince \u2014 who has a gigantic song catalog and admirers across the pop, jazz and probably classical spectrum \u2014 stuck to the familiar. It started with Prince\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 band the Time playing two of its own hits, \u201cJungle Love\u201d and \u201cThe Bird,\u201d songs Prince wrote with them (under the name Jamie Starr) and largely recorded himself. The Time had their old dance moves, which some audience members joined in on, but the choice of material was self-serving. Then Bruno Mars arrived to play \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d like a Prince tribute band, with costumes (purple jacket, ruffled shirt), equipment (a white guitar with a long appendage) and showmanship modeled directly on the movie \u201cPurple Rain\u201d; Mr. Mars even handled the guitar solos. Mr. Mars is a skillful, well-studied mimic, and that was all it took to have \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d rev up the room.JON PARELESJOE COSCARELLIThere can be a thin line between campy and cheesy, but there\u2019s no question where the Grammys\u2019 tribute to the Bee Gees fell, and it wasn\u2019t campy. Flashing lights and disco dancers on stage were a homage to \u201cSaturday Night Fever,\u201d the 1977 blockbuster that mainstreamed disco and gave the Bee Gees a clutch of hits. The movie\u2019s star, John Travolta, had made an appearance earlier in the show. But songs that are lodged in pop\u2019s collective memory weren\u2019t a comfortable fit for Demi Lovato, who shrilled through \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d or Tori Kelly, who tried to turn \u201cTragedy\u201d into rock, or Andra Day, who overplayed \u201cNight Fever.\u201d (At times Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees was shown gamely singing along in the audience.) Little Big Town\u2019s country harmonies worked amiably enough in \u201cHow Deep Is Your Love,\u201d but it was a brief respite. The real, if undesignated, Bee Gees tributes came earlier; both the Keith Urban-Carrie Underwood duet \u201cThe Fighter\u201d and the Weeknd\u2019s \u201cI Feel It Coming\u201d (with Daft Punk) had the thump of disco Bee Gees deep in their DNA.JON PARELESJOE COSCARELLIGrammy host James Corden opened the show with vaudevillian shambles: a stuck platform, an exaggerated series of fumbles down a staircase, and a performance executed with one shoe missing, ostensibly a sort of meta-commentary on his not-quite-steady footing as Grammys host. It was perhaps a strange way to open a show about flawless execution, but turned out to be mildly prophetic for a night that was pockmarked with missteps, from Adele\u2019s live call for a restart during her George Michael tribute, to the way the orchestra played over her producer Greg Kurstin when they accepted the song of the year trophy (and misspelled his name earlier in the night, to boot), to the Metallica performance during which James Hetfield\u2019s microphone was nonfunctional for the first half.JON CARAMANICAAdvertisement"}

Yes, he uses watercolors to depict mountains and valleys, the sun and shadows and trees and waterways. But though the results are gorgeous, they are also entirely practical: He paints trail maps for ski resorts.Since 1987, he\u2019s captured almost 200 of the world\u2019s most famous collections of runs, including Aspen Highlands, Squaw Valley and Big Sky, and ones as far afield as China, New Zealand and Serbia. Mr. Niehues, 71, is on the road to retirement, and taking on fewer projects. Throughout his career, he\u2019s been fully aware how real people were using his creations.\u201cI always used to worry about whether, if I didn\u2019t put a tree in and someone hits the tree, are they going to sue me?\u201d he said.Q. Why do ski resorts employ map artists?How do you create a trail map?First I go up in a plane or helicopter to get aerial photographs, or I get aerial photographs supplied by the mountain. Then I produce a black-and-white sketch from those photographs that show the mountain trails and its structures. I even draw in the shadows. Then I transfer it onto an illustration board and add in the color and details with watercolors. I like to show the mountain at the time of day when the shadows are just catching the snow. That way you can actually see the surface of the slopes.Have you ever messed up?Once I had to go back and change the direction of the shadows. It was a cloudy day when they took the photos, and there was no Google Earth to check, so I had the shadows running the wrong way. It taught me to really be sure of where the sun is, even if it isn\u2019t showing up in my photographs. I go to great extremes to make sure the map is correct. Sometimes I ski the mountain, and the resort personnel, who know these mountains like the back of their hands, look it over.What is it like to be in the air taking photos of the ski areas?Will computers replace artists?When computers make the maps, you don\u2019t get the real feel of the outdoors, and it\u2019s hard to show the skier the terrain they are in. For example, it\u2019s important to show the difference between deciduous trees and conifers because if you are out skiing and you want to go through the trees, conifers are different.Are there any ski resorts you believe are overlooked?How should skiers use trail maps?Trail maps get you down a hill, but they are also an important tool for marketing the mountain. There is probably not another image that is as identified with a resort. You should look at a trail map and then be encouraged to go and ski the mountain.Because of an editing error, the Q&A column last Sunday, with the artist James Niehues, misstated the year he began making ski trail maps. It was 1987, not 1997.Advertisement"}

Just ask the Republican National Committee, which sent out a tweet this week for Lincoln\u2019s Birthday quoting the 16th president as saying, \u201cAnd in the end, it\u2019s not the years in your life that count, it\u2019s the life in your years.\u201dIn my experience, Lincoln is a popular source of dubious quotations for Op-Ed contributors, but he pales in comparison with Winston Churchill and Jefferson.\u201cCapitalism is the worst economic system, except for all the others,\u201d sounds pretty Churchillian, and a nice line to add to an essay defending globalism, for example. But he didn\u2019t say it, and even what he did say, in a House of Commons speech \u2014 \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried\u201d \u2014 he attributed to somebody else, as the Churchill scholar Richard Langworth has pointed out.Similarly, \u201cEternal vigilance is the price of liberty,\u201d sounds like a plausible Jeffersonian line to drop into an essay about government surveillance (and to be fair, Jefferson was a quote machine, taking up nearly three pages in my version of Bartlett\u2019s). But there\u2019s no proof he ever said it in any of his voluminous correspondence. An 18th-century Irish orator did write something like this, but having John Philpot Curran on your side may not add much heft to your argument.Our faulty memories are partly to blame for all this, but a bigger problem is the internet. Plenty of quotation-aggregration sites on the web have Jefferson saying \u201ceternal vigilance,\u201d or Churchill saying, \u201cThe best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.\u201d The creators of those sites seem to be quite skilled at making sure they come up first in the results when an opinion essayist does a search for \u201cJefferson quotes on liberty.\u201dSo, the Republican National Committee intern or staff member who put up the spurious quotation has my sympathy.

{"Headline": "For Marketers, TV Sets Are an Invaluable Pair of Eyes", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Ellen Milz and her family were watching the Olympics last summer, their TV was watching them.Ms. Milz, 48, who lives with her husband and three children in Chicago, had agreed to be a panelist for a company called TVision Insights, which monitored her viewing habits \u2014 and whether her eyes flicked down to her phone during the commercials, whether she was smiling or frowning \u2014 through a device on top of her TV.\u201cThe marketing company said, \u2018We\u2019re going to ask you to put this device in your home, connect it to your TV and they\u2019re going to watch you for the Olympics to see how you like it, what sports, your expression, who\u2019s around,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Whatever, I have nothing to hide.\u2019\u201dMs. Milz acknowledged that she had initially found the idea odd, but that those qualms had quickly faded.\u201cIt\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d she said, comparing it to the Nest security cameras in her home. She said she had initially received $60 for participating and an additional $230 after four to six months.TVision \u2014 which has worked with the Weather Channel, NBC and the Disney ABC Television Group \u2014 is one of several companies that have entered living rooms in recent years, emerging with new, granular ways for marketers to understand how people are watching television and, in particular, commercials. The appeal of this information has soared as Americans rapidly change their viewing habits, streaming an increasing number of shows weeks or months after they first air, on devices as varied as smartphones, laptops and Roku boxes, not to mention TVs.\u201cThe big thing for TV advertisers and the networks is: Are you actually looking at the screen or not?\u201d said Dan Schiffman, the chief revenue officer of TVision (pronounced Tee-Vision). \u201cWhat you looked at is interesting, but the fact that you looked away is arguably the most interesting.\u201dMr. Schiffman founded TVision, a 30-person start-up, with a classmate from the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T.But some industry executives have criticized Nielsen\u2019s methods as outdated. Nielsen selects homes at random to represent the nation\u2019s viewing audience, and measures who is watching what shows, mostly through meters connected to the sets, as well as diaries in select markets and digital tracking of certain ad-supported programs on tablets and phones.\u201cNielsen will remain the currency for the time being because it is agreed upon as the thing everyone uses,\u201d said Alan Wurtzel, an adviser at NBCUniversal and its former head of research. \u201cBut as the world becomes more complex, as it is, many more additional supplemental or complementary measures will come into play.\u201dInformation gathered by companies like TVision can help advertisers steer marketing toward shows with the most engaged audiences, not just the largest ones. And for networks, it could make a show with a committed and loyal audience as valuable as one that attracts a larger but more casual set of viewers.TVision has recruited 2,000 households, or roughly 7,500 people, in the Boston, Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth areas. The company said the information was transmitted without storing images or video and collected anonymously.Mr. Schiffman said the data would show, for example, \u201cPerson No. 124 in Household 6 was paying attention this second and not paying attention the next to a certain program or advertisement.\u201dSymphony and TVision both use technology that can recognize shows and ads through the audio or digital tags the content contains. Consumers are most likely familiar with this type of technology through the song-recognition app Shazam.Another ratings company, RealityMine, has assembled a panel of 5,000 people in the United States whom it said it paid less than $90 a year, who either have its app, a \u201chome meter\u201d plugged into their internet networks or both. In some instances, its meter may capture activity across 25 devices in a household, such as tablet, phone, Xbox, Wii, Apple TV and Google Chromecast.The aim is \u201cunderstanding what is the media day and the life of the consumer today,\u201d said Charlie Buchwalter, the chief executive of Symphony, which has worked with companies including NBCUniversal.Mr. Schiffman said that while some people were wary of TVision\u2019s technology, they were often placated after learning that it was not storing images or videos.During the Olympics, Ms. Milz wore a Fitbit so that NBC could see how her heart rate changed while she watched certain events.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to understand where people really are and what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re watching, how are they interacting, and ideally after that, how is that changing their behavior or affecting their behavior,\u201d said Jonathan Steuer, the chief research officer of Omnicom Media Group, which oversees media buying for advertisers.By measuring the level of attention a person is paying to a given show, TVision believes it can help bolster niche programs and smaller networks. For example, Mr. Schiffman said the company had found that the series \u201cLucifer,\u201d on Fox, commanded better attention metrics from viewers than \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d on CBS, even though \u201cBig Bang\u201d is one of the TV shows rated highest by Nielsen.\u201cPeople don\u2019t just tune into \u2018Lucifer.\u2019 They DVR it and watch it when they come home,\u201d he said, adding that viewers tend to be focused on the show and stay in the room when it is on.The Weather Channel used TVision\u2019s data in the fall to give it an edge over the news and lifestyle shows it is normally compared against by advertisers. It showed its audience for weather news as \u201clean forward, lean-in viewers,\u201d said Indira Venkat, who oversees research at the channel.\u201cWhat is oftentimes missing is the quality of the audience,\u201d Ms. Venkat said about Nielsen viewing data. \u201cYes, you\u2019re getting audience, but what are they doing in today\u2019s era of multitasking?\u201dFollow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter @Sapna.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn\u2019t wear one.\u201dThe White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes.Within moments of Mr. Spicer\u2019s comment, reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe.Mr. Spicer added that the story was \u201cso riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology.\u201d He went on, \u201cLiterally, blatant factual errors, and it\u2019s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or so-called reporting.\u201dThe overall piece, which described Mr. Trump\u2019s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic shake-up of a Washington culture he has never inhabited, was \u201cnot an accurate portrayal of what\u2019s really happening,\u201d Mr. Spicer concluded.Mr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning.On Twitter, Mr. Trump called the reports \u201cfake news\u201d that sought to marginalize him.If you missed Mr. Trump talking to Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News during the Super Bowl, you will have another chance tonight.In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to characterize The Times\u2019s coverage, which was based on interviews with several of his White House\u2019s most senior officials and others aware of the administration\u2019s inner workings, as \u201cfiction\u201d based on fabricated sources.It\u2019s official: Silicon Valley really, really despises Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order.The brief, filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is blunt and direct. The ban, it says, \u201chinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations \u2014 and hire new employees \u2014 outside the United States.\u201dIt is a remarkable statement of unity from the country\u2019s technology companies, many of which rely heavily on foreign workers. And it is a shot across the bow for Mr. Trump, foreshadowing a rocky relationship with Silicon Valley leaders over the next four years.The companies were not the only ones joining in opposition. Susan E. Rice, former President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, was among the leaders of a petition signed by a group of former National Security Council officials.The Justice Department on Monday corrected the record on an attention-grabbing claim that one of its lawyers made in a Northern Virginia courtroom about the impact of President Trump\u2019s executive order on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.That number, however, came under question later on Friday, when a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs said that the real number was around 60,000 and that the larger figure had inaccurately included diplomatic visas that were not affected by the ban.\u201cIn response to a question from this court as to how many individuals have been affected by the executive order, government counsel presenting oral argument, based on information he had received, stated that 100,000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of the executive order,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Department of State has since provided undersigned counsel with a revised number, which is roughly 60,000 visas.\u201dAn outside, pro-Trump political group is adding veteran fund-raisers and Republican Party strategists, and is also employing one of the president\u2019s campaign ad makers to try to ensure Senate confirmation of his remaining cabinet nominees.It\u2019s part of a $4 million effort, with three other ads focused specifically on the nominations of Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Tom Price for secretary of health and human services.Some of those ads have been broadcast in states with critical races in the 2018 midterms. The other new advisers are Cara Mason, who worked as the finance director for the Trump Victory committee under Reince Priebus; Rob Collins, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director; Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff; and Rob Simms, a former National Republican Congressional Committee executive director.With Mr. Trump\u2019s administration still evolving, the 45Committee has moved to fill a void, supporting the White House as it finds itself besieged by critics.Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff known for his uncompromising stance on illegal immigration, is back in the news months after losing his bid for re-election.Now he is asking supporters to help him raise $1 million for his legal defense fund. Mr. Arpaio faced numerous lawsuits alleging abuse and faulty medical care in several jails, and taxpayers in Maricopa County, where he was sheriff, spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense.In his email, Mr. Arpaio attributed his re-election defeat to a host of enemies, including \u201cleftist financier George Soros,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department.Mr. Soros spent an estimated $2 million last year opposing Mr. Arpaio, and the Justice Department under Mr. Obama filed criminal contempt-of-court charges against the sheriff for refusing a judge\u2019s order to stop discriminating against Latinos.As the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s largest county, Mr. Arpaio gained a national reputation for immigration raids that targeted heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around the Phoenix area.Thousands of people were caught up in the raids, which were often carried out without any proof of criminal activity, and which critics called racial profiling.Advertisement"}

Not surprisingly, user growth is at a peak.\u201cIn the past we\u2019ve taken steps to reduce spam and clickbait, and now we\u2019re approaching misinformation and hoaxes the same way,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said during a conference call with investors. He pointed to the company\u2019s closer ties to publishers and fact-checking organizations and the high priority it had placed on making changes to its news feed and ad network.The controversy over fake news seemed to have little effect on users\u2019 appetite for the website. Total profit for the quarter was $3.6 billion, annual ad revenue was up roughly $10 billion compared with 2015, and more than half of the site\u2019s 1.86 billion regular visitors used it daily.\u201cThe verdict is nonmaterial to our business,\u201d Sheryl K. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview. \u201cWe had a really strong quarter, capping off a really great year.\u201dFacebook paid $2 billion to acquire Oculus, which makes a headset, the Rift, that immerses users in 3-D games and videos. Mr. Zuckerberg has predicted that virtual reality could be the next big computing platform, like the smartphones of today or the personal computers of a decade ago.The financial damages were far lower than the up to $6 billion that the plaintiff, the games publisher ZeniMax Media, had sought, in part because the jury was unmoved by its argument that Oculus employees stole ZeniMax trade secrets.In a statement, Tera Randall, a spokeswoman for Oculus, said the company planned to appeal the verdict.\u201cThe heart of this case was about whether Oculus stole ZeniMax\u2019s trade secrets, and the jury found decisively in our favor,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed by a few other aspects of today\u2019s verdict, but we are undeterred.\u201dThe damages were nonetheless meaningful to ZeniMax, which publishes the Elder Scrolls series, the Fallout series and other well-known video games. The jury based the damages award on finding a series of copyright and trademark violations involving ZeniMax software by one or more of the defendants, a group that included Oculus and several of its employees.The biggest portion of the award stemmed from the finding that Palmer Luckey, an Oculus founder, had violated a confidentiality agreement he signed with ZeniMax as he was forming Oculus. ZeniMax said it was exploring options for preventing Oculus from its continued use of computer code that infringes on ZeniMax copyrights, including seeking a court order.\u201cTechnology is the foundation of our business, and we consider the theft of our intellectual property to be a serious matter,\u201d said Robert Altman, ZeniMax\u2019s chairman and chief executive. \u201cWe appreciate the jury\u2019s finding against the defendants and the award of half a billion dollars in damages for those serious violations.\u201dThat figure may decrease as litigation between the companies continues. But Facebook may not be too worried about it.As the results announced Wednesday showed, Facebook\u2019s dominance in internet advertising is surpassed only by Google\u2019s. And Ms. Sandberg\u2019s latest efforts to woo small businesses are paying off: Tens of millions of businesses market their products across Facebook and Instagram, the photo-sharing app it owns.Shares of Facebook rose 2.5 percent, to $136.69, in after-hours trading.Wall Street is looking for Facebook to show revenue growth outside its news feed, the social network\u2019s moneymaking ad machine. The company has cautioned analysts that it is nearing the limit of its ad load \u2014 the amount of ads it chooses to place between user-posted content like news stories and status updates \u2014 inside the feed.That means increased pressure on properties like Instagram, which recently announced that it had more than 600 million users.Although Facebook does not disclose revenue figures for Instagram, it said on Wednesday that five million businesses were now on the app and that its latest feature \u2014 a messaging service similar to Snapchat \u2014 was already being used by a quarter of Instagram\u2019s user base.An article on Feb. 2 about Facebook\u2019s loss in a court case, using information from a representative for the plaintiff, misstated the financial damages that the games publisher ZeniMax Media had sought in its lawsuit over the theft of trade secrets involving the virtual reality start-up Oculus, now owned by Facebook. ZeniMax sought up to $6 billion, not $4 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Intelligent Weaponry Gets Smarter", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert O. Work, the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump, calls them his \u201cA.I. dudes.\u201d The breezy moniker belies their serious task: The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts, and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield.Last spring, he asked, \u201cO.K., you guys are the smartest guys in A.I., right?\u201dNo, the dudes told him, \u201cthe smartest guys are at Facebook and Google,\u201d Mr. Work recalled in an interview.Now, increasingly, they\u2019re also in China. The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology, which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare.The Pentagon\u2019s plan to bring A.I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies.Last year, for example, Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech.That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence.Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons. In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on brand-new Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nation\u2019s leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons.But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls.In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagon\u2019s ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, today\u2019s new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees.As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nation\u2019s government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence.Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field.\u201cThe Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies,\u201d said Adam Segal, a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at the Council on Foreign Relations.The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as \u201cremote warfare,\u201d said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers.\u201cThey are making their machines more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cA little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost.\u201dWhether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States.Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and self-confident to understand the speed of the Chinese competition.\u201cThere are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then U.S. media reports only on the U.S. version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the U.S.\u201dThe company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a \u201cHumanoid Answering Robot.\u201d\u201cOur goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future,\u201d said Qingfeng Liu, Iflytek\u2019s chief executive.The speed of the Chinese technologists, compared to United States and European artificial intelligence developers, is noteworthy. Last April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intel\u2019s laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from Intel and Google to build a self-driving car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal \u2014 taking a demonstration to the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas \u2014 after just nine months of work.\u201cThe A.I. technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely home-brewed,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cWe wrote every line by ourselves.\u201dTheir first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis.The United States\u2019 view of China\u2019s advance may be starting to change. Last October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is now publishing more research than scholars here.Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make A.I. a priority in its military systems.Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view.\u201cIt is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in A.I., and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a Taiwanese-born artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both Microsoft\u2019s and Google\u2019s China-based research laboratories.Mr. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $675 million to invest in A.I. both in the United States and in China.\u201cUsing a chess analogy,\u201d he said, \u201cwe might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the master-level A.I. scientists.\u201dWhat is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American A.I. research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China.In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baidu\u2019s Silicon Valley A.I. Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit Stanford University artificial intelligence courses.One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom.Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly.In a reflection of the desire to become a center of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by Intel\u2019s Xeon processors; after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing.The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge. It can be used to model climate change situations, for instance, or to perform analysis of large data sets.But similar advances in high-performance computing being made by the Chinese could be used to push ahead with machine-learning research, which would have military applications, along with more typical defense functions, such as simulating nuclear weapons tests or breaking the encryption used by adversaries.The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward J. Snowden\u2019s revelations about the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to China\u2019s market.Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley.\u201cNo one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon can\u2019t say it\u2019s about China, and the tech companies can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cBut it\u2019s there in the background.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Protesters Borrow From Tea Party to Put Pressure on Lawmakers", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "Opponents on the left are making plans to show up in force when members of Congress hold town forums during this month\u2019s recess.Supported byMORRISTOWN, N.J. \u2014 For weeks, a swelling group has been showing up every Friday here at the local office of Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen to demand that he hold a town-hall meeting to answer its concerns about his fellow Republicans\u2019 plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.After weeks without an answer, the congressman\u2019s staff replied that he would be too busy, that such gatherings took considerable planning and that just finding a meeting place could be tough.So the group, NJ 11th for Change, secured venues in all four counties that Mr. Frelinghuysen represents for times during the congressional recess this month \u2014 and constituents plan to show up even if he does not.With congressional phone lines overloaded and district offices mobbed across the country, it\u2019s beginning to look a lot like 2009.That year, horrified by a new president they saw as a radical, activists took to the streets under the Tea Party banner to protest government bailouts, then stormed forums held by congressional Democrats to fight legislation that would become the Affordable Care Act.With methodical door-to-door campaigns in the next year\u2019s midterm elections, the Tea Party ended the careers of some of the nation\u2019s most senior lawmakers. It pushed the Republican Party to the right, stymied the Obama agenda and ultimately paved the way for an outsider to win the White House.This year, it is that new president, Donald J. Trump, who is cast as a radical. And as the resistance to him on the left tries to turn the massive protest rallies of the last two weeks into political power, it is borrowing explicitly from the Tea Party playbook. The early result has been the biggest outpouring of constituent anger on members of Congress since the Tea Party\u2019s rise.\u201cWe borrowed the organizing and taking to the streets from the left. They\u2019re borrowing the showing up outside offices and doing legislative contact from us,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, who helped organize and train Tea Partyers as a staff member of FreedomWorks, a libertarian group in Washington.Last week, groups that organized the nationwide women\u2019s marches in January announced local \u201cNext-Up Huddles\u201d to plan more local political actions, starting with crowds at town forums during the congressional recess beginning Feb. 20. And another group, the Town Hall Project 2018, is keeping a list of where members of Congress will hold meetings that week, encouraging constituents to show up the way Tea Partyers did in the summer of 2009.\u201cI don\u2019t embrace the tactics so much that I want to say let\u2019s go to the extreme,\u201d Ms. Farnan added. \u201cBut I do embrace the idea that if your congressman wakes up worrying that he\u2019s not going to be re-elected, it\u2019s a good thing. I want him to wake up worried.\u201dLike many of the initial Tea Partyers, many of the resisters on the left say they had never been involved in politics. They simply got frustrated yelling at their televisions.Now, they organize on social media, and download apps, like Countable, that allow them to track lawmakers\u2019 votes and to contact them. Some are running for long-vacant Democratic precinct leadership positions as a way to gain access to voter information that they plan to use in door-to-door canvassing.And just like many Tea Partyers, the resisters of 2017 are getting what Elaine Patterson, a constituent marching on Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s office, called \u201ca big civics lesson.\u201d\u201cA friend asked me, \u2018Does Congress have any say in the president\u2019s appointees?\u2019\u201d Ms. Patterson recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I learned it was the Senate.\u201dThe resisters insist theirs are more polite protests. \u201cWe send thank-you notes to members of Congress after we show up,\u201d said Hillary Shields, a paralegal who helped start Indivisible Kansas City. But the Tea Partyers say they did the same thing.And like the Tea Partyers, members of the resistance declare that the very soul of the nation is at stake.Having watched the results of the presidential election with mounting gloom, Ms. Farnan, in Colorado, said she had to act, for her children. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to say, \u2018What did you do when this happened?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m making a paper trail. You\u2019re going to see we did stuff.\u201dBut while it took the Tea Party months to register as serious opposition, the resistance on the left has already rattled Capitol Hill. Congressional offices report being overwhelmed by calls, letters and faxes about Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet appointees. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, said she had been persuaded by calls from constituents when she announced she would vote against Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos.\u201cThe women are in my grille no matter where I go,\u201d Representative Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, told an audience last week. \u201cThey come up, \u2018When is your next town hall?\u2019 And believe me, it\u2019s not to give positive input.\u201dA vast chasm separates the parties when it comes to the issues, but in protesting the other side there appears to be some common ground.As Mr. Steinhauser, the Tea Party activist, planned rallies in Washington in 2010, he cited as one of his heroes Bayard Rustin, for his persistence in organizing blacks for the March on Washington in 1963.\u201cFor the right, Barack Obama represented an existential threat to the American way of life. And for the left, Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the American way of life,\u201d Mr. Steinhauser said. \u201cAnd I take the current protesters at their word that they\u2019re that afraid and concerned about the changes Trump is going to make very quickly.\u201dBut he questioned whether the left could stick to one of the Tea Party\u2019s most successful strategies, which was to purposefully \u2014 if not entirely successfully \u2014 steer away from divisive social issues and talk about economic issues instead.Resisters want nothing to do with the uglier elements of the Tea Party \u2014 the rallies where politicians were burned in effigy. But they are eager to model its electoral tactics.\u201cThat whole strategy, most of it was legitimate,\u201d said Michele DeVoe Lussky, a small-business owner who recently helped organize Indivisible West Michigan.Ms. Shields, in Kansas City, said: \u201cThey call it resistance, but really it\u2019s just being a good citizen, showing up at town halls, paying attention to legislation, calling your representative. That\u2019s just civics.\u201dEarlier versions of picture captions with this article misstated the name of the group meeting each Friday at a New Jersey office of Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen. As the article correctly notes, the group is named NJ 11th for Change, not Fridays With Frelinghuysen, which is what the event is called.Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Grandville, Mich.Advertisement"}

They were thumbing through online dictionaries, looking for a definition of \u201cimpugn.\u201d On Wednesday morning, the dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster posted on its website that searches on the word had surged.\u201cIt\u2019s been at the top for almost 12 hours now,\u201d said Peter Sokolowski, the company\u2019s editor at large.As he wrote on the Merriam-Webster website: \u201cImpugn means \u2018to oppose or attack as false or lacking integrity\u2019 or \u2018to criticize (a person\u2019s character, intentions, etc.) by suggesting that someone is not honest and should not be trusted.\u2019 It comes from the Latin word pugnare meaning \u2018to fight,\u2019 which is also the root of pugnacious and pugilism.\u201dA tweet posted to the dictionary\u2019s feed linking to this definition quickly racked up several hundred retweets.At a time when many are questioning the definition of common words they thought they understood, after years of the English language being degraded by text messages and hashtags, dictionaries have made a surprising comeback in the United States.On dictionary apps and websites, \u201clookups\u201d (which, according to Merriam-Webster, is one word) of words or phrases related to news events have precipitously increased.

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars Might Need Standards, but Whose?", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe PC revolution, the internet boom, the smartphone economy \u2014 all were propelled along by a common set of technological standards. So will a standard platform or operating system be necessary to get autonomous cars rolling, too?Car companies have come to realize that existing in-car systems, with their tangled layers of software and morass of hundreds of embedded processors, are slow and overly complex by today\u2019s computing standards. If autonomous cars are ever to become a reality, they will require even more powerful, more fully integrated and upgradable computing platforms, designers say.A more centralized approach could bring huge cost savings by reducing the number of processors used in a car and thus reducing the need for the cabling among those processors. Less wiring would also lower a car\u2019s weight to improve fuel economy, Mr. Shapiro said.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Mr. Montague said the challenge today is that every car has a unique constellation of electronic control units, sensors and microphones. The software must be specially tailored to each model.There is no shortage of companies vying to become the equivalent for self-driving cars of the Windows/Intel standard for PCs. Chip makers like Nvidia \u2014 as well as Intel \u2014 hope to establish their hardware as the new brains behind autonomous vehicles. Delphi, QNX and Waymo (the former Google self-driving project) are looking to put their software front and center as the operating system of choice. Each wants to sell its own car platform to automakers.The traditional automotive culture, however, has emphasized independence. And some industry experts point to economic factors that argue against settling on a standard platform. Being dependent on a single vendor can mean higher prices.\u201cAutomakers don\u2019t want to rely on Apple or Google,\u201d said Glen DeVos, vice president for software and services at Delphi. \u201cBut they also don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel all the time.\u201dEmblematic of that carmaker culture is Hyundai, which is mostly going it alone in working on its self-driving entry. The company recently demonstrated how far it has come, ferrying journalists in Las Vegas around in a self-driving version of its Ioniq electric compact car. Hyundai, which likes to emphasize that it even makes its own steel, has developed its own platform, striving for affordability.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use a common system,\u201d said Cason Grover, senior group manager for vehicle technology planning innovation at Hyundai. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to go down one path that hinders us in the future from introducing new innovations.\u201dBosch, which supplies safety and technology systems to automakers, including its own self-parking technology, acknowledges that a single, one-size-fits-all system would be easier to work with. \u201cBut it would be a killer for innovation,\u201d said Detlef Zerfowski, vice president for automotive system integration at Bosch.Douglas L. Davis of Intel, recently charged with spearheading that company\u2019s new self-driving car platform, Go, said, \u201cGiven the amount of computing power necessary for autonomous driving, we think it can benefit from greater commonality and predictable interfaces.\u201d\u201cMobileye already has the computer vision, for example,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if the technology is good, why re-engineer it and take two to three years to get it into a product?\u201dWhich design philosophy one chooses can have significant repercussions when it comes to the security of robotic cars, evoking visions of hackers causing mayhem by crashing cars and trucks into each other at highway speeds. It\u2019s a problem engineers are keenly aware of.\u201cHaving a common platform could have a downside,\u201d Mr. Wall at QNX acknowledged. \u201cIf there\u2019s a vulnerability in one car, it could mean there\u2019s a vulnerability in every car.\u201dConversely, Mr. Wall pointed out that de facto software standards mean that more programmers are focused on making those systems as secure as possible, versus having only a few coders working on a single, narrowly used program.But by developing as much of the technology as possible themselves, some automakers believe they can solve problems more quickly.\u201cA side benefit of controlling the entire thing,\u201d said Mr. Grover at Hyundai, \u201cis that we know everything that\u2019s going on.\u201dA lack of standards and a diversity of self-driving systems does present one other obvious challenge: Variety is not a virtue when cars must interact predictably with human drivers \u2014 and other robotic vehicles \u2014 to guarantee safety.Riding in Hyundai\u2019s self-driving Ioniq, for example, is like taking a Sunday drive with your grandmother. The car is extremely adept at staying squarely in its lane without ping-ponging back and forth, but it is also cautious in the extreme, stopping nine feet short of crosswalks and stubbornly refusing to go forward if a pedestrian looks poised to step off the sidewalk. It is behavior that can ignite road rage in nearby human drivers.By comparison, Delphi\u2019s test car, which uses an Intel computing platform installed in an Audi Q5, is more aggressive. It can easily merge into highway traffic and negotiate complex intersections. However, it treats pedestrians with less deference, taking right-hand corners more quickly \u2014 even though pedestrians may be contemplating entering the crosswalk.\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference in the algorithms and even sensor choices being used,\u201d Mr. Grover said, which can affect how collision-prevention and lane-keeping systems work. When autonomous cars do hit the road, he said, you could have a fair amount of variation in how they behave.\u201cThere are quite a few different approaches to creating autonomous systems,\u201d said Ralf Herrtwich of Here, which is making high-resolution maps for the next generation of vehicles. Mr. Herrtwich said the necessary standards might come not from the car platform itself, though, but from the communications side.Indeed, there are already cars like the 2017 BMW 5 Series that can broadcast information about road hazards over a cellular connection, but only other BMWs can make use of the warnings.Technology suppliers, platform vendors and automakers acknowledge that self-driving cars are still in their infancy and that as the vehicles mature, standards will be forthcoming.Most car manufacturers are still struggling just to establish standards across their own models and brands, Mr. DeVos of Delphi said.\u201cOnce that happens,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we can talk about how to work across different companies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Danish Companies Seek to Hire, but Everyone\u2019s Already Working", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was just one hitch: He did not have enough employees for the job.Delivery was delayed, by one month, then two, then three, as he searched for skilled welders to speed the work at the sprawling factory. But in Denmark\u2019s fast-recovering economy, they were hard to come by.More than a third of companies in this industrial and technically advanced nation can no longer recruit enough skilled workers to fill posts. Vacancies abound for I.T. specialists, computer scientists, engineers and mechanics, as well as for electricians and carpenters. The wages needed to lure them are creeping up. Affected firms are scaling back production, turning down contracts and postponing expansion plans.\u201cWe need more skilled workers, but we can\u2019t get them,\u201d said Mr. Enevoldsen, who recently joined other companies in a nationwide advertising campaign to lure talent. \u201cIf the labor shortage continues, it could sharply impact our growth, and growth in general.\u201dEurope\u2019s recovery is gaining traction fastest in the north, where Britain, Germany and Denmark\u2019s Nordic neighbors also pushing toward full employment. The unemployment rate has fallen in the United States as well, and some economists have expressed optimism the country may be headed in that direction.But the experience in Denmark shows what can happen with too much of a good thing.After a painful recession, unemployment is now at 4.3 percent, which is about as low as it can go without provoking inflation. During an economic boom a decade ago, joblessness fell as low as 2.4 percent, igniting an unsustainable spiral of higher wages and prices that the government desperately wants to avoid today.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see higher growth because we don\u2019t have the labor needed for that,\u201d said Steen Nielsen, the director of labor market policy at the Confederation of Danish Industry, the country\u2019s main business lobby group. \u201cWe may have to be happy with low growth rates in the future unless we can stimulate labor supply.\u201dSome employers have also looked to refugees to fill jobs, but few of the newcomers are readily employable in high-skilled work, and the government tightened policies recently to discourage more asylum seekers from coming in.Germany, which faces a shortage of engineers, nurses and other skilled workers, has taken the opposite tack, setting up training programs for refugees in an attempt to bridge the gap.In Denmark, some companies have resorted to creating jobs abroad.\u201cWe wanted to hire in our own country but it was impossible,\u201d said Janus Benn Sorensen, one of the company\u2019s three founders. \u201cWe still have vacant positions here, and we can\u2019t find anyone to take them.\u201dAt Sjorring, Mr. Enevoldsen tried for more than a year to add skilled welders and industrial designers to the 275-person work force. The company, which has won business from Volvo and Caterpillar, has a 20-acre factory in Denmark\u2019s forested north that runs a partly automated assembly line.He offered a salary bump of more than 2 percent, but raising wages further would crimp his margins. Though he managed to recruit some Eastern European workers, he still lacks manpower.Last year\u2019s delayed order for the European client, worth 600,000 euros, or $637,000, was eventually completed. But he worried that the labor shortage could keep Sjorring from reaching the next level.\u201cWe could have grown even more if we had the right people, that\u2019s indisputable,\u201d said Mr. Enevoldsen, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, who has turned to a headhunter to find eight welders and machine programmers.Others are having similar problems. Teccon Form, which makes tools for injection molding and employs around 20 designers and mechanical engineers, had to turn away potential customers last year because it couldn\u2019t expand staffing.\u201cThere\u2019s just not that many people out there who aren\u2019t in a job,\u201d said Michael Nederby, the company\u2019s managing director. He is now searching in Germany, Poland and Portugal for workers. \u201cThe problem will get worse in coming years.\u201dAnd not everyone who could be working is doing so: Around 92,000 Danes are collecting jobless benefits, and companies say many of them could be employed.The government is testing measures to encourage early retirees, students and recipients of disability pensions to work. Businesses are also lobbying lawmakers to intensify the teaching of technology and vocational skills in schools to churn out more young Danes prepared for a high-tech world.Even big companies feel the pinch. Microsoft\u2019s Denmark operation had trouble recruiting I.T. workers, then struggled to get marketing and sales representatives, said Marianne Dahl Steensen, the company\u2019s general manager in the country. Because of its scale, Microsoft is able to lure skilled foreign workers to Copenhagen, but keeping them is a top priority.\u201cWe make sure to have a very modern, flexible workplace,\u201d Ms. Steensen said. The company emphasizes gender and ethnic diversity, and works with refugees and the long-term unemployed to cultivate talent.For smaller Danish companies, solutions cannot come fast enough.Clio Online started with three employees and now has 90 in its crowded Copenhagen office, creating content for teachers and students, including real-time course materials about President Trump or the Women\u2019s March on Washington.The company quickly became Denmark\u2019s market leader. But ambitions to expand, thanks to orders from nearby Sweden or further afield in Saudi Arabia, whose government is digitizing libraries and educational texts, hit a ceiling.It opened its Ukraine office three years ago, but cultural differences slowed efficiency. For instance, employees would not proceed with a work request from the Danish team until they vetted it with higher-ups in Ukraine.The company\u2019s chief marketing officer, Thomas Overholt Hansen, estimates it lost up to \u20ac1.5 million in potential revenue last year as the labor shortage limited its ability to serve new clients.\u201cWe\u2019re losing money every day,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But the bogus claims just keep coming.Germans are fleeing their country, fearful of Muslim refugees. The Swedish government supports the Islamic State. The European Union has drafted rules to regulate the ethnicity of snowmen.In a year when the French, Germans and Dutch will elect leaders, the European authorities are scrambling to counter a rising tide of fake news and anti-European Union propaganda aimed at destabilizing people\u2019s trust in institutions.As officials play catch-up in the fight against sophisticated hacking and fake news operations, they fear Europe and its elections remain vulnerable at a critical moment: The region\u2019s decades-old project of unity hangs in the balance, challenged by populist forces within the bloc and pressures from Russia and beyond.\u201cIf you look at how European media, and even big American media, are covering the issue now, I would say that it is those few people on that team who have been able to raise awareness,\u201d said Jakub Janda, a deputy director with European Values, a think tank based in Prague, who has worked with East Stratcom.Many false claims target politicians who present the biggest obstacles to Moscow\u2019s goal of undermining the European Union. Others seek to portray refugees from the Middle East as terrorists or rapists, fomenting populist anger.In France, the head of the En Marche! party said last week that Russian news channels had targeted the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, who belongs to the party and is running on a pro-European Union platform. Richard Ferrand, the party\u2019s secretary-general, said the campaign\u2019s databases and websites had been hit by \u201chundreds, if not thousands,\u201d of attacks from inside Russia.But its list of 2,500 fake reports is small compared with the daily churn across social media. Catching every fake news story would be nearly impossible, and the fake reports the team does combat routinely get a lot more viewers than its myth-busting efforts.One of the biggest problems policy makers across Europe say they face is a lack of tech specialists. Germany recently passed a cybersecurity law that called for a rapid response team to combat hacking attacks. Officials quietly acknowledged, though, that they would need three teams, if they could only find people to staff them.Despite the regionwide push to counter false reports, experts question whether such fact-checking efforts by governments and publishers will have a meaningful effect. Fake reports can easily be shared through social media with few, if any, checks for accuracy.Officials are also anxious about hackers\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the email accounts of candidates and politicians to steal compromising information.Much like their American counterparts, security experts warn, European politicians remain highly vulnerable, though national intelligence agencies are now strengthening lawmakers\u2019 security protocols.In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing tough competition ahead of elections in September, the country\u2019s domestic intelligence service already has reported a sharp rise in so-called phishing attacks in recent months aimed at political parties and members of the country\u2019s Parliament.The German government is weighing potential hefty fines for tech giants like Google and Facebook, whose platforms allow false stories to be quickly circulated. The companies insist that they cannot be held responsible because they do not generate the stories.Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service, said that although there was no \u201csmoking gun,\u201d Russia was likely to be involved in the increase in online misinformation aimed at destabilizing German politics.American tech giants also have stepped in after they were accused of not doing enough to counter false reports on their platforms, accusations that Facebook, Google and other companies deny. They are now funding initiatives in the United States, France and elsewhere to flag fake news online and remove posts if they are found to violate companies\u2019 terms of use or local laws.Such efforts across Europe have gained momentum since the United States\u2019 presidential election.Soon after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in November, David Alandete gathered his team in the El Pa\u00eds newsroom in downtown Madrid with one goal in mind: to respond to fake news.Like many journalists, Mr. Alandete, the Spanish newspaper\u2019s managing editor and a former United States correspondent, had seen waves of false reports during the presidential campaign, many directed at Mexico \u2014 a country that accounts for roughly half of El Pa\u00eds\u2019 online readership.\u201cTrump winning was a major turning point for us,\u201d Mr. Alandete said. \u201cMany of our readers were asking whether they could even travel to the States.\u201dNot all of El Pa\u00eds\u2019s myth-busting targets, though, have been about politics.\u201cMany people don\u2019t trust institutions anymore,\u201d Mr. Alandete said. \u201cWe see fake news coming from everywhere.\u201dBeno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

The most popular of the 30 360-degree videos that the Las Vegas authority has released since March is an actual drive down Las Vegas Boulevard.\u201cThey get to experience a destination,\u201d Ms. Tull said. \u201cIt allows them to make a decision to come.\u201dIn January 2016, Tourism Australia introduced a series of 360-degree films depicting aquatic and coastal travel experiences there, including snorkeling in the great barrier reef and watching the sun set over Sydney Harbor.\u201cWe have a very competitive landscape in destination marketing, with national tourist offices spending a lot of money,\u201d said Lisa Ronson, the group\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cWe need to be able to tell the story of Australia in new and engaging ways.\u201dThen there is the desire of some companies to appear cutting-edge. Maria Walter, managing director of product development and brand strategy for United Airlines, said one reason it had opted to use virtual reality to begin promoting its new Polaris business class service last summer was that the technology could help the carrier re-establish itself as an innovator.More than 10,000 people \u2014 members of the general public and travel trade, as well as United employees \u2014 watched a 360-degree virtual reality demonstration of Polaris at roadshows in the carrier\u2019s domestic hub cities last year. More will do so at events this year in Europe, Asia and Australia.Many people who watched the demonstration last year were using virtual reality for the first time, Ms. Walter said. \u201cIt definitely got their attention in a way a brochure would not,\u201d she said.Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst for Atmosphere Research, suggested that premium travel brands, as well as destinations trying to reposition themselves or reach a new group of consumers, were turning to virtual reality because it provided \u201cauthentic, breakthrough creative content.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an ad,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have an experience.\u201dOne of the earliest adopters of virtual reality was Marriott Hotels, which in 2014 introduced \u201cteleporter\u201d booths that it took to hotels around the United States, letting guests experience a black-sand beach in Maui and the view from the top of Tower 42 in London while wearing an Oculus Rift headset.Other hotel companies \u2014 including St Giles Hotels, a London-based company that has nine hotels worldwide, and Best Western \u2014 have followed suit.Carnival Cruise Line chose Zach King, a star on YouTube and Instagram, to appear in a 360-degree video it released in the fall to promote its latest ship, the Carnival Vista. And this spring the Marriott Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest loyalty programs together plan to release a series of 360-degree films on destinations worldwide that will be hosted by an as yet unidentified social media influencer.Best Western\u2019s strategy is more straightforward: As of last summer, it had placed 360-degree films, made with Google Street View technology, of each of its 2,000 North American hotels on YouTube. It will eventually do the same for many of its hotels overseas.Virtual reality, said Tammy Lucas, vice president of marketing for Best Western, \u201cfits so perfectly into the hotel space. People really want to know what they\u2019re going to get. It offers them an opportunity to set their expectations.\u201dExpedia\u2019s take on the technology is somewhat unusual. Although it has used it in films promoting travel deals to Australia, in March it started a fund-raising campaign involving virtual reality for the St. Jude children\u2019s hospital.Expedia \u201cfundamentally believes that when people travel, it affects them and the world around them,\u201d said Vic Walia, senior director of brand marketing for the company. \u201cIt has the power to transform you and shapes your views of the world. We recognize that while most of us can travel, there\u2019s a group of kids at St. Jude who can\u2019t.\u201dAt Expedia\u2019s request, the hospital identified four children it was treating for cancer who had \u201cdream adventures,\u201d such as deep-sea diving in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, and visiting the Monkey Jungle in Miami. Expedia sent four of its employees, equipped with 360-degree camera equipment and live-streaming technology, to these places; it then projected their live footage in a special installation at the hospital, where each child could have his or her own virtual and immersive travel experience, interacting with the Expedia employees.Advertisement"}

It said Anthony Levandowski, who runs Uber\u2019s autonomous car division, downloaded files from Google a month before leaving to start his own self-driving car company, Otto, which was later bought by Uber.As for the sexual harassment accusations from Susan Fowler, the former employee, they have prompted an investigation into the workplace culture at Uber.Snap, the parent company of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, is trying to whip up investor interest before its initial public offering.But so far, one of the most talked-about features of its I.P.O. is the overwhelming control that the founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, will retain through voting power not available to its public shareholders.To understand why it came about, it is worth looking back at Snap\u2019s history.This irked Mr. Spiegel, who took steps to reassert control.He struck a deal to allow Lightspeed to buy shares at a discount in exchange for it removing certain onerous terms, like a right-of-first-refusal on the next funding round.

{"Headline": "Teaching and Learning About Governmental Checks and Balances and the Trump Administration", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCivicsSince Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States, a flurry of executive orders, court rulings, presidential nominations and confirmation hearings have brought questions about the roles of the three branches of government to the center of national discourse.In the hallways of Middle School 447 in Brooklyn, talk of gay rights and President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration has replaced chatter about \u201cthe Kardashians or Beyonc\u00e9, or somebody\u2019s new sneakers,\u201d said Leslie Hughes, a seventh-grade English teacher.In this lesson, students use current events to analyze how our constitutional system of checks and balances works, and they investigate executive orders to see how these particular presidential actions fit within that system.How are you teaching this topic? Let us know._________In short: The principle of separation of powers is the underlying reason the federal government is divided into three branches (executive, legislative and judicial), with each branch wielding different powers established in the Constitution. This division of powers among the three branches operates as a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from gaining too much power. For example, the president can negotiate a treaty with a foreign government, but the Senate has to approve it for the treaty to become binding. And, if a president commits treason or bribery, Congress can impeach him or her.Once students have an understanding of checks and balances, they are ready to do the activities described below._________Part I: Find and Analyze Examples of Checks and Balances in Current EventsThe president, his cabinet and the agencies they oversee; the two houses of Congress; the various federal courts \u2014 all these government actors are constantly at work making, implementing and interpreting laws. In the process of doing their jobs, they sometimes have to check the authority of another branch.Here are some examples of articles related to checks and balances just from the first few weeks of the new Trump administration:Once they find an article, students should take notes on the following:Then, the class can share the various examples cited and discuss what each example reveals about how well our system of checks and balances works.Students can also look at the relationship between the White House and Congress, now that both the executive and legislative branches are controlled by the same party. How much should the American people expect a Republican Congress to hold a Republican president accountable if his actions or policies cross the line?Additional questions students can consider about the U.S.\u2019s system of checks and balances include:\u2022 To what extent is it clouded by politics?\u2022 Is it effective at stopping overreaches of power?\u2022 Is it fair and reliable?Part II: Consider the Value of a Free Press as a \u201cFourth Branch\u201d of GovernmentThen, invite students to investigate President Trump\u2019s relationship with the role of the free press._________Part III: Investigate President Trump\u2019s Executive OrdersAn executive order is a signed, written, and published directive from the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.The bar association\u2019s explanation continues:Executive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect.Even though the president has the power to issue executive orders that have the force of law, the president must always cite what specific laws \u2014 or the Constitution itself \u2014 grant him the authority to issue his order. In addition, these orders are reviewable by the federal courts.\u2022 What policy change is the president ordering the federal government to make? (Students might find some of the legal jargon challenging, but they can still try to figure out what policy change the president is making.)\u2022 By searching in The New York Times, Google News and other sources what can you find out about how the public and the media reacted to the executive order? Did it make headlines? What has been the reception? Is it being challenged in any way via the system of checks and balances?\u2022 What\u2019s your personal reaction to the executive order? Does it seem important? Does it seem like good public policy?Pairs can share what they learned through their research and discuss their opinions of these presidential actions._________Part IV: Evaluating the Relationship Between the President and the JudiciaryStudents can watch Judge James Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle deliver his opinion in the five-minute video above, and then discuss what they noticed about his justification for suspending the president\u2019s executive order, including how he described his role within our system of checks and balances.But President Trump\u2019s public contempt for the judicial branch and his denigration of specific judges who hand down rulings unfavorable to him seem to be breaking new ground in the relationship between the executive and judicial branches.President Trump is barreling into a confrontation with the courts barely two weeks after taking office, foreshadowing years of legal battles as an administration determined to disrupt the existing order presses the boundaries of executive power.The article continues:Lawyers and lawmakers of both parties said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments reflected a lack of respect for the constitutional system of checks and balances.Late in the day, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to pre-emptively blame the judge and the judiciary for what the president suggested would be a future terrorist attack.\u2022 Is President Trump promoting a lack of respect for the court system with his comments?\u2022 Are Mr. Trump\u2019s public statements about judges and the judiciary branch weakening our system of checks and balances? Why or why not?\u2022 Or, should his statements not be taken so seriously?\u2022 Has more recent news continued Mr. Trump\u2019s strained relationship with the judicial branch? Explain.After writing about or discussing the above questions, students can imagine they are a legal adviser to President Trump. What advice would they give the president about how our system of checks and balances is supposed to work, and what role he as president should have within that system._________Evaluating Trump\u2019s Nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: A Lesson PlanAnalyzing Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban: A Lesson PlanEvaluating Sources in a \u2018Post-Truth\u2019 World: Ideas for Teaching and Learning About Fake NewsThe Inauguration of a New President: A Lesson Plan on Predicting and Evaluating the First 100 Days of a Trump White HouseChecks and Balances: Teaching American Government and Law With The New York TimesAdvertisement"}

She had been one of the first lawyers on the scene and later began organizing the crush of volunteer attorneys.Within days, the group had set up servers, Google spreadsheets and a steering committee. Sprawled across crowded tables and the terminal\u2019s polished floors, they used their laptops and cellphones to write manuals on how to help travelers.And things moved quickly at Terminal 4.Chris Hennessy, 24, a volunteer from Harlem, stumbled upon the group and began picking up trash and getting coffee for the lawyers. A few days later, he was the project coordinator.Others who couldn\u2019t make it to the airport showed their support.A stack of pizzas was delivered. A sorority from Kean University sent bags of ramen. A box of toothbrushes arrived.\u201cThey must think we\u2019re not showering,\u201d Ms. Mackler said.(While it was a round-the-clock operation, most volunteers didn\u2019t spend more than eight hours at a stretch there, she added.)While most of the lawyers have now left the airport (a skeleton crew will still mill about the terminals), they are vowing to remain active offsite.\u201cNow we know how to do rapid response, if we need to,\u201d Ms. Mackler said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready for the next fight.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:A cool one, but a lovely one.Soak it up while it lasts; rain and flurries are on their way for much of the rest of the week.A new public park near the Battery Tunnel in Lower Manhattan will commemorate the thousands of Arab immigrants who lived in the neighborhood around the turn of the 20th century.There remain, however, a few sites from Little Syria that can be visited on Washington Street today, Mr. Fine said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Massacre That Wasn\u2019t, and a Turning Point for \u2018Fake News\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorThat\u2019s because there was no massacre there. No one died. No one even stubbed a toe. But there\u2019s a good chance you know that by now: that the supposed terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Ky., that Ms. Conway, a top presidential adviser, invoked on MSNBC last week to justify President Trump\u2019s contentious travel ban never happened. (And, no, the reason you had never heard of it was not because the Dishonest Media ignored the alleged carnage at the time of its non-happening, as Ms. Conway alleged.)The very fact that you probably know all this means that the \u201cBowling Green Massacre\u201d may go down in the record of the Trump presidency as the first break in the \u201cfake news\u201d clouds that have cast such gloom over our fair and once (relatively) true republic.The same internet that enabled false stories to run unchecked through news feeds during the election year dispatched new white blood cells that attacked Ms. Conway\u2019s \u201calternate facts\u201d with \u201ctrue facts\u201d (a redundant term that I guess we\u2019re stuck with for now). Their most effective attack was traditional reporting, in many cases from news organizations that have doubled down on fact-checking, joined by newfangled memes that accentuate the truth.It\u2019s early. Vigilance, and continuing improvements throughout the news business, remain necessary. But the tale of the \u201cmassacre\u201d could be the start of something new.Ms. Conway\u2019s mention of the supposed attack \u2014 she was trying to justify Mr. Trump\u2019s order that closed the border to citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries \u2014 slipped past the MSNBC host interviewing her, Chris Matthews. The corrective story broke the way stories have broken since God invented newspapers: A guy walked into a bar.The authorities never charged the men \u2014 one of whose fingerprints turned up on a roadside bomb in Iraq \u2014 with planning an attack on American soil.It made like a Trump tweet and roared through the broader news media sphere.\u201cThat tweet got 2.4 million impressions,\u201d Mr. Sonka said. \u201cPretty crazy.\u201dIn the end, social media and journalistic scrutiny aligned with comedy to right a wrong pretty definitively. That it happened so organically showed that false \u201cfacts\u201d might not always be the stubborn things so many people fear they are becoming.Then there are the regular Trump Tweets calling CNN or The Times \u201cfake news.\u201dThe Bowling Green episode made such a splash because it played directly into concerns that the Trump administration would use untrue assertions to rally support for its agenda while denigrating as \u201cdishonest\u201d all the valid reporting pointing out the falsehoods.But even before the Bowling Green story fell apart so spectacularly, there were signs that what had worked well during the presidential campaign last year might not succeed when it comes to the real-world work of government.All the accusations of \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cdishonest media\u201d couldn\u2019t erase images of crying relatives stranded at airports \u2014 or the reporting on the legal questions surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order that led a judge to temporarily suspend it.Ditto for the blowback over the whole Bowling Green yarn. Ms. Conway went on to admit her error, first on Twitter (where else?) and later in an interview with Howard Kurtz of Fox News, saying it was overblown because \u201cI misspoke one word.\u201d (By that, she meant, apparently, that she should have said \u201cBowling Green terrorists\u201d rather than \u201cBowling Green massacre.\u201d)It would be a positive development if Ms. Conway embraced the idea that the term \u201chonest mistakes\u201d can apply to reporters, too, as it would be if everybody \u2014 including journalists \u2014 doubly committed to getting the facts right, without hysteria or misfires. Too optimistic?Well, if you had asked me a few days ago what I was planning to write about, I wouldn\u2019t have said it would involve praising Twitter for keeping the national debate reality-based \u2014 and fun.Eventually, the Bowling Green memes led to mock street memorials with signs like \u201cNever Remember.\u201d They had made it IRL, or \u201cIn Real Life,\u201d which, the new administration is learning, has a way of sneaking up on you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Homo Deus\u2019 Foresees a Godlike Future. (Ignore the Techno-Overlords.)", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesIn retrospect, some books seem tailor-made for the thought-leader industrial complex. Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s \u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,\u201d which came out in the United States two years ago, was clearly one of them.\u201cThe future masters of the world will probably be more different from us than we are from Neanderthals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhereas we and the Neanderthals are at least human, our inheritors will be godlike.\u201dI do not mean to knock the handiwork of a gifted thinker and a precocious mind. But I do mean to caution against the easy charms of potted history. Harari, a historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has a gift for synthesizing material from a wide range of disciplines in inspired, exhilarating ways. But an argument can look seamless and still contain lots of dropped stitches.In a nub: \u201cHomo Deus\u201d makes the case that we are now at a unique juncture in the story of our species. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d Harari writes, \u201cmore people die today from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists, and criminals combined.\u201dHaving subdued (though by no means vanquished) famine, pestilence and war, Harari argues, we can now train our sights on higher objectives. Eternal happiness. Everlasting life. \u201cIn seeking bliss and immortality,\u201d he writes, \u201chumans are in fact trying to upgrade themselves into gods.\u201dIf you\u2019re acquainted with the story of Icarus, you know that these prideful efforts don\u2019t tend to end well. Harari imagines that in attempting to refine ourselves to utter perfection \u2014 the logical apotheosis of humanism, whose history and evolution he traces over many pages \u2014 we will destroy humanism itself.Our slow creep toward the uncanny valley has already begun. We take pills that change our affect and select embryos with the best odds for optimal health. Google has an offshoot, Calico, whose modest mission is to slow the aging process. Throw in advancements in biological and cyborg engineering, and our radical transformation, in Harari\u2019s view, seems quite feasible.\u201cRelatively small changes in genes, hormones and neurons,\u201d he points out, \u201cwere enough to transform Homo erectus \u2014 who could produce nothing more impressive than flint knives \u2014 into Homo sapiens, who produce spaceships and computers.\u201d Why should we assume that Sapiens are the end of the evolutionary line?Yet a question arises: If we aren\u2019t at the end of the line, what comes next?The short, chilling answer: a future that looks like Westworld, rather than Disney World. A small, breakaway republic of superhumans and techno-elites will eventually split off from the rest of humanity. Those who acquire the skills and proprietary algorithms to re-engineer brains, bodies and minds \u2014 the main products of the 21st century, Harari suspects \u2014 will become gods; those who don\u2019t will be rendered economically useless and die off.And then, without our realizing it, we\u2019ll wake up one sunny morning and realize we\u2019ve given ourselves over completely to machines. We just have to pray they don\u2019t go rogue. The nanobots in our bodies tracking cancer could be hacked by North Koreans and start doing lord knows what. \u201cOnce artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence,\u201d Harari writes, \u201cit might simply exterminate mankind.\u201dWhich at least puts liberals\u2019 current woes in perspective. A world run by strongmen and kleptocrats is nothing compared with a world run by robot overlords. Governments in that situation would be much less powerful than Google.This dystopian vision rests on many questionable assumptions, of course. One of them is that we don\u2019t have free will, and never did, a philosophical question that Harari insists on treating as settled. Another is that humans will somehow shed their collaborative, social instincts (which, as he stressed in \u201cSapiens,\u201d are what made us so successful in the first place). Maybe students will eventually learn exclusively from computer programs. But I\u2019m guessing they\u2019ll still crave other students to discuss what they\u2019ve learned. Maybe computers will hand us our medical diagnoses. But we\u2019ll still crave doctors to explain them.Harari willfully, almost irrationally, ignores this idea. \u201cIf your CT indicates you have cancer, would you prefer to receive the news from a cold machine, or from a human doctor attentive to your emotional state?\u201d he asks. \u201cWell, how about receiving the news from an attentive machine that tailors its words to your feelings and personality type?\u201dI\u2019d still take the flesh-and-blood messenger with the stethoscope, thanks.Only on Page 399 \u2014 three pages before the footnotes begin! \u2014 does Harari concede that maybe organisms aren\u2019t even algorithms at all.Harari promises that \u201cHomo Deus\u201d is not a prophecy. Let\u2019s hope so. After the viral plague of fake news articles and the shame of so many privacy scandals, the peak days of Silicon Valley worship may be behind us. If any part of the future Harari describes is true, all I can say is: #Resist.Advertisement"}

But do you know anyone who uses WhatsApp and desires features like these?I mostly see people using WhatsApp to keep in touch with others overseas. I\u2019m not sure this will stick with consumers or help Facebook lure people away from Snapchat.

{"Headline": "Amit Singhal, Uber Executive Linked to Old Harassment Claim, Resigns", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A little more than a week after Uber faced stinging accusations that it had ignored female employees\u2019 complaints of sexual harassment, the company dismissed the head of its engineering efforts for failing to disclose a sexual harassment claim from his previous job.The executive, Amit Singhal, joined Uber last month after overseeing Google\u2019s search efforts in a 15-year career at that company. He was asked to resign on Monday by Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive.The move came after Uber learned that Mr. Singhal did not disclose the circumstances of his departure from Google, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not allowed to speak on private personnel issues and asked for anonymity.The former Uber engineer Susan Fowler and other current and former employees have claimed that the company\u2019s human resources officials repeatedly ignored harassment claims about employees who were \u201ctop performers.\u201dThe issue involving Mr. Singhal dates to 2015, when he was still at Google. The search giant deemed an employee\u2019s claim of sexual harassment against Mr. Singhal \u201ccredible\u201d in an internal investigation, according to two people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak on the matter.\u201cHarassment is unacceptable in any setting,\u201d Mr. Singhal said in a statement Monday. \u201cI certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior. In my 20-year career, I\u2019ve never been accused of anything like this before, and the decision to leave Google was my own.\u201dUber and Google declined to comment on Mr. Singhal.Mr. Singhal was hired to oversee Uber\u2019s mapping division as well as a unit that runs the dispatching, marketing and pricing of Uber cars. He reported directly to Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, and advised Anthony Levandowski, who runs the company\u2019s self-driving automobile efforts.Mr. Singhal\u2019s dismissal is another example of both the talent pipeline and the competition between Google and Uber. Last week, Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, filed a lawsuit against Uber accusing it of colluding with Mr. Levandowski, a former Google employee, to steal its autonomous vehicle technology.

{"Headline": "Inside the New Saint Laurent", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "As Anthony Vaccarello assumes the storied mantle at the French house, the past is never far.Supported byYes. But which? There are three houses of Saint Laurent, scattered across Paris. Each is different, in usage and in mood: the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. This is \u201cSaint\u201d Laurent we\u2019re talking about, bestower of the contemporary wardrobe, the man who put women into pantsuits, a tortured artist in couture and the inventor of 20th-century style. No designer has ever been closer to godliness, in the eyes of the fashion industry, and specifically the French, than he.The first house of Saint Laurent is located on the tony Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 on Paris\u2019s Left Bank \u2014 the Rive Gauche, which Saint Laurent named his ready-to-wear line after in 1966. It\u2019s around the corner from the apartment of Karl Lagerfeld, the designer\u2019s sometime friend and most-of-the-time bitter rival; Yves Saint Laurent himself lived in an apartment on the Rue de Babylone, just a few blocks away. This location is the creative hub of the company, housed in a 17th-century h\u00f4tel particulier, painstakingly refurbished and planted with one of those coldly geometric, Le Notre-ish box-hedge gardens. Vaccarello\u2019s predecessor, Hedi Slimane, determined the d\u00e9cor and the general ambience of sleek modernity and distinctly French formality. But Slimane was based in Los Angeles. Today, it\u2019s where Vaccarello works, with his studios traditionally divided into tailleur and flou, like a true French haute couture house.There\u2019s also a Saint Laurent house on Rue de Bellechasse: formerly an abbey and the Ministry of Defense and currently a shell, destined to become the brand\u2019s corporate headquarters. Against dismal financial outlooks for many of luxury\u2019s biggest players, Saint Laurent has bucked the odds: It grew more than 25 percent during 2016, breaking the billion-dollar mark in annual turnover for the second year in a row. Today, the business makes roughly three times the amount it made five years ago, and as of 2016 figures, has swelled to be the second largest player in the luxury portfolio of Kering Group, the conglomerate that owns a majority stake in it.Against that backdrop \u2014 of vast fortune, and of a house literally being rebuilt \u2014 Vaccarello showed his Saint Laurent debut in September. There were klieg lights and a 32-foot neon YSL logo dangling from a crane, like a crib mobile, a baited hook or the sword of Damocles, depending on your outlook and degree of cynicism. Vaccarello could, feasibly, want to meet there.Finally, there\u2019s 5 Avenue Marceau. If the first location represents the creative heart of Saint Laurent and the second its commercial head, this address is its soul. It\u2019s where Saint Laurent\u2019s haute couture house stood, making made-to-measure clothes for a clientele composed of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most discerning women. Although the building remains the same, the ateliers closed in October of 2002, when Saint Laurent retired. Since then, it has been home to the Fondation Pierre Berg\u00e9-Yves Saint Laurent, a charity devoted to showcasing works of art, and fashion, that intersect with the designer\u2019s oeuvre and interests. At least, it was until last April; this fall, after extensive renovations, it will reopen with a slightly simpler name, as the Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent. (There will be a counterpart in Marrakesh, on the appropriately named Rue Yves Saint Laurent.)History has always meant a lot to Saint Laurent \u2014 history and continuity. Yves Saint Laurent had four French bulldogs, all named Moujik: When one died, it was swiftly replaced with a close likeness. It\u2019s been the same with the house\u2019s creative successors. While Saint Laurent himself was at the helm, he ceded control of his ready-to-wear women\u2019s wear to the designer Alber Elbaz, better known in his later role as head of Lanvin, and men\u2019s wear to a young Frenchman named Hedi Slimane. Slimane returned in 2012 as creative director of the entire label. In between, it was helmed by the designer-cum-director Tom Ford, and the Italian Stefano Pilati. Slimane exited the label for the second time last spring, and was replaced by Vaccarello, a young Italo-Belgian. All their collections have, to a degree, been contemporary reincarnations of Saint Laurent\u2019s illustrious past.It\u2019s exceptional to be allowed to see this. Upon hearing that I\u2019m a journalist, the workers eye me suspiciously and shield their work protectively until reassured by Yewande Animashawun, the premiere (head) of the tailoring workroom. They are not only concerned about revealing next season\u2019s designs \u2014 a degree of furtive secrecy is standard practice in fashion. But for the past four years in particular, the house of Saint Laurent was impenetrable. The previous creative director, Hedi Slimane, had an uneasy relationship with the fashion press, rarely granting interviews and refusing to invite a number of journalists and critics to his shows.By contrast, Vaccarello says he wants to capture the warmth of Saint Laurent\u2019s early years. I ask if the atelier remembers that time, if any of the original staff remains. \u201cThere are some from that period,\u201d he says \u2014 14 staff members from Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s era still work with the company. \u201cThe artistic director changes, but the most important people stay.\u201dVaccarello is slim, dark-haired, with hooded eyes and a sparse beard covering his chin. It\u2019s flecked with gray, although Vaccarello is only 37. He speaks with a heavy French accent, having grown up in Brussels, the non-Flemish speaking part of Belgium. Vaccarello is also faultlessly modest \u2014 and not just when deferring importance to his atelier. He dubbed his own debut collection a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d underscored by his decision to present it in the construction site of the new Saint Laurent headquarters. Perhaps humility is a necessary virtue when being awarded one of the trickiest gigs in the business.Not only is Saint Laurent one of the most influential brands, creatively and culturally, but now, thanks to the success of Slimane, it\u2019s also one of the biggest financially. Whoever designs for the house of Saint Laurent instantly becomes a star. Vaccarello is now in charge of a $283 million-a-year business and the job of reinterpreting Saint Laurent\u2019s legacy as he sees fit: revamping boutiques, reshooting advertising, entirely revising its visual identity.The history of Saint Laurent, and hence of contemporary expectation, hangs like that Damoclean sword. Complicating matters, some of that history is still living; Saint Laurent died in 2008, but his partner in business and in life, Pierre Berg\u00e9, sat front-row at Vaccarello\u2019s debut. Now 86, Berg\u00e9 became romantically involved with Saint Laurent shortly after their first meeting in 1958; the two lived together until 1976 and Berg\u00e9 served as C.E.O. of Yves Saint Laurent Haute Couture until its closure. During 40 years in fashion, Berg\u00e9 forged a reputation for his passionate, fiery temper and for a certain severity. It comes through today, undiluted and as recognizable as Berg\u00e9\u2019s face, with its proud nose, shock of silver hair and raised, jutting chin. The buttonhole of his lapel is stitched with a hairline tricolor loop of ribbon that signifies he is a Grand Officer of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur.\u201cI don\u2019t know very much Anthony Vaccarello \u2014 I\u2019ve seen only one collection,\u201d he emphasizes, emphatically. \u201cClear?\u201d Berg\u00e9 pauses, fixing a steely glare. \u201cIt is not my business ... I want to be very clear with you. I respect very much Pinault \u2014 the father and son. They never ask me my advice \u2014 happily \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to give it.\u201d Berg\u00e9 has been outspoken in the past. He is still a close personal friend of Hedi Slimane \u2014 he employed him first \u2014 but was famously dismissive of Tom Ford and Stefano Pilati. Vaccarello is treated more generously. \u201cThe difference between Vaccarello and Ford and Pilati is that he likes Saint Laurent,\u201d states Berg\u00e9, sternly. \u201cHe tries not to imitate. I do not expect a fashion designer to imitate Saint Laurent.\u201dVaccarello\u2019s interpretation, to many eyes, was unexpected. Instead of obvious, outright homage, he chose to base his first collection on a leopard-print dress from Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s July 1982 collection. The original was made when Vaccarello was 2.It\u2019s an obscure starting point for a Saint Laurent collection. As any fashion nerd will swiftly explain, Saint Laurent is hurrahed as the greatest designer of the last century. Rising to fame when appointed Christian Dior\u2019s successor in 1957, he scandalized the establishment three years later by basing a collection on Parisian Existentialists (the initial glimpse of his beloved Left Bank in his clothes) and for making a black leather jacket. His \u201cBeat\u201d line was the first couture collection inspired by the street, and foreshadowed the youthquake counterculture of the 1960s as well as punk. Shortly after, Dior permitted Saint Laurent to be conscripted into the army (he had deferred twice previously), and quietly replaced him. In 1961, Saint Laurent founded his own house with Berg\u00e9 (who sued Dior for breach of contract to raise the capital). He then set about revolutionizing fashion.He made trousers for women fashionable, and transmogrified masculine staples such as Caban coats and safari jackets into seductive women\u2019s wear pieces. (He also did the same with Little Lord Fauntleroy knickerbockers, with less lasting impact). He was the first to bare breasts in a fashion show, under a layer of chiffon, in 1968; he spectacularly revived the shoulder pad in his \u201cForties\u201d collection of 1971, which became the blueprint for a silhouette that would dominate the 1980s; and he launched designer ready-to-wear in 1966, upending the hierarchy of the entire fashion industry and sounding the death knell for the influence of haute couture, if not its actuality. His final show, in 2002, was staged at the Centre Pompidou before 2,000 guests, and was projected on massive outdoor screens to thousands more. It closed with Saint Laurent being serenaded by Laetitia Casta \u2014 then the Marianne \u2014 and Catherine Deneuve, whose wardrobe he designed for the 1967 film \u201cBelle de Jour.\u201d Two French national monuments, honoring a third.How do you compete with that?\u201cTo be honest, I did it without thinking too much,\u201d Vaccarello says simply. \u201cWhen I arrived, my first thing was to meet Pierre Berg\u00e9, to really understand the house, and the spirit of who Yves Saint Laurent was. Pierre Berg\u00e9 was, for me, the most important person to listen to and to see before. Then I went to the archive, to exercise what I had in my mind. For every image I had in my head, I wanted to see the real clothes.\u201dI reel them off, as anyone who has paid attention to fashion for the last half-century would: dresses patterned with Piet Mondrian\u2019s paintings, the \u201cLe Smoking\u201d tuxedo, the Ballets Russes collection, the green fur chubbie jacket from that 1971 collection. Vaccarello nods to them all.\u201cI was taking them out of my head. I saw all of that in one week. It was quite amazing. And then I was thinking, how to do my Saint Laurent, now? And how to make it differently than how it was done by all the designers before? I wanted to make something to dream about, not something real. Saint Laurent, when he started, did real clothes. Those real clothes are everywhere, in the stores, in Zara, everywhere. You dress like he predicted in the \u201970s. So I didn\u2019t want to do the Caban, the trench, the Saharienne. I wanted to do dresses that were like collages, not a real piece that I saw at the archive.\u201dConsidered from that perspective, Vaccarello\u2019s Saint Laurent debut makes sense. The dresses were, he says, composites of elements from Saint Laurent\u2019s history: the poufy, blousy sleeve of that 1982 dress; a bow from 1991; the lace from a 1971 dress shot by Jeanloup Sieff \u2014 all mixed together to create a fusion that speaks to the present. It\u2019s like design via Google image search: type in \u201cYSL\u201d and grab a bit from everywhere. The silhouettes Vaccarello produced were short, racy, leggy, with an inflated \u201980s shoulder sometimes slipping down the arm. They spoke not of couture but of club culture. A few dresses, with scooped-out necklines in velvet or leather, were chopped into tops above bluejeans \u2014 the only item of clothing Saint Laurent famously said he wished he\u2019d designed. Vaccarello then studded the outfits with identifiable bits of Saint Laurent iconography, like the tassels reminiscent of his Chinoiserie collection as earrings, or the Cassandre-designed \u201cYSL\u201d piercing ears or embedded as heels on shoes.\u201cEveryone has an idea of Saint Laurent,\u201d says Vaccarello, with an exasperated sigh. \u201cBut he did so many things. It\u2019s impossible ... \u201d Impossible to live up to? Impossible to span all of those in a single collection? Or maybe just impossible to please everyone? Perhaps that\u2019s why Vaccarello went for styles out of left field as opposed to those great greatest hits. \u201cMore than another house, when you see everything that Yves Saint Laurent did ... \u201d Vaccarello\u2019s voice trails off. \u201cYou do flowers, he did it. You do lacing, he did it.\u201dMarcel Proust insisted that remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were. That\u2019s frequently the case with Yves Saint Laurent, who, incidentally, was sufficiently obsessed with Proust to base the d\u00e9cor of his chateau on his work, and to commission Louis Vuitton to create a monogrammed crate to cart his volumes of \u201c\u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu\u201d around in. Contrary to popular belief, Saint Laurent wasn\u2019t universally canonized. His trendsetting 1971 collection was severely dismissed at the time. He was nicknamed \u201cYves Saint Debacle\u201d and the collection was called \u201ca tour de force of bad taste.\u201dThe debuts of Saint Laurent\u2019s successive successors have, famously, been less than successful, each individually undergoing a baptism by fire. Some dubbed Tom Ford\u2019s version \u201cslick,\u201d as a pejorative; Pierre Berg\u00e9 pointedly refused to comment. Saint Laurent himself, still alive, would not attend. Stefano Pilati\u2019s was described as clich\u00e9d French, his ruffled skirts compared to chicks in an Easter parade. A few said that Slimane\u2019s early outings resembled Topshop or the stylist Rachel Zoe\u2019s eponymous line. \u201cAt Saint Laurent, everyone hate ... \u201d laughs Vaccarello. \u201cI find it fascinating. I like it. Maybe I\u2019m a masochist or something, but I like that it\u2019s a passionate house, you love it or hate it.\u201dCritical reviews of Vaccarello\u2019s first show were mixed: The French, he stated, eyebrows raised, were laudatory. Others, not so much, specifically the powerful American newspapers. \u201cI like having different opinions of what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he says magnanimously, when I broach the subject. He was pleased that Berg\u00e9 seemed pleased. \u201cHe loved what you could connect the most to Yves Saint Laurent,\u201d Vaccarello says.Vaccarello seems, on the surface, unconnected to Saint Laurent. His sensibility has been sniped at by Italians and Belgians as smacking too much of each other. Vaccarello recalls that when studying at La Cambre, the Belgian fashion academy that also educated Olivier Theyskens, he was asked to pick a contemporary designer\u2019s work to study. Others chose the Belgian deconstructionist Ann Demeulemeester, or the minimalist Helmut Lang. Vaccarello chose Tom Ford. After working in Rome under Karl Lagerfeld at Fendi, Vaccarello established his own label in 2009, gaining attention for souped-up short-and-sexy dresses in the body-contouring mold of Azzedine Ala\u00efa as well as that of Ford. He was plucked by Donatella Versace to design her Versus line in 2014 in much the same formula.Saint Laurent is an unexpected step, given that path. Even Vaccarello didn\u2019t anticipate the offer from Kering. \u201cI had a lot of propositions for working for houses before. It was always a no. I didn\u2019t want to leave my brand if it was not for something like ... this,\u201d Vaccarello shrugs, looking into a full-length mirror, inlaid into a marble alcove. \u201cI went, because I am polite. It was very clear, no, no, no. But as a joke I said \u2018The only house I will stop my brand for and would be interested to work with is Saint Laurent.\u2019\u2009\u201d When he was officially given the Saint Laurent job, Vaccarello sat on the news for a few months as rumors swirled, before the official announcement was made in April of last year.Vaccarello\u2019s office at Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 is, roughly, the size of his former studio in its entirety. It\u2019s currently pinned with the elements he\u2019s planning to integrate into his next collection, due to be shown in March. There are no fabrics or sketches, just image after image, layered over each other, in sections titled \u201cBig Black Sequins\u201d or \u201cAnimal Embroideries.\u201d There are lots of \u201980s party dresses, in the same vein as that of Vaccarello\u2019s debut. There are a bunch of fur coats. An image of a famous fall 1980 Saint Laurent haute couture jacket embroidered with a quote from the Jean Cocteau poem \u201cBatterie\u201d sits next to a photograph of Debbie Harry in a slogan tee. \u201cThat\u2019s the starting point,\u201d states Vaccarello, tapping it. \u201cBut everything can change.\u201dVaccarello will show some men\u2019s wear, but there\u2019s the sense he isn\u2019t massively involved in that side of the business, although men have featured in his Saint Laurent campaigns. Generally, the men are used as accessories to the women \u2014 like those big tasseled earrings, or the logo heels. Image is important to Vaccarello. He\u2019s shot three print campaigns, although he\u2019s only produced one collection. The first featured mostly-naked models writhing in denim, photographed by Collier Schorr; the second, by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, which was released in magazines in October, effectively previewed Vaccarello\u2019s first collection, with the model Anja Rubik in a short leather dress with exaggerated shoulders. The full campaign images hit magazines this spring, again photographed by Schorr and entirely different from the October shots. \u201cFor me the image of Saint Laurent is sometimes more important than the collection,\u201d states Vaccarello bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s not about clothes, it\u2019s more about a mood, an emotion, a way to live, a way to move. Rather than buy that jacket, buy that bag.\u201dSaint Laurent, as a house, has been a master image manipulator. Yves Saint Laurent famously posed for a nude portrait to advertise his first men\u2019s fragrance. A later campaign for his wildly successful Opium scent courted controversy with its caption, \u201cFor those who are addicted to Yves Saint Laurent.\u201d Slimane, too, showed the power of image: Despite unfavorable criticism of his clothes, they sold, due in part to the polished campaigns and a rehauling of the label\u2019s overall aesthetic. Perhaps that will be the real litmus test for Vaccarello: Can he carve a distinct identity for his own tenure? After all, Vaccarello\u2019s debut dresses aren\u2019t enormously different than the after-dark proportions of Slimane\u2019s collections.Ultimately, success is marked by how well the clothes sell. For all that fuss about the history of Saint Laurent, for all the thousands of garments hermetically sealed in the archives, how much does legacy really matter? How much do ordinary customers care about the cultural capital of storied brands like Saint Laurent, so prized and cosseted and worshiped by the industry? Should one have to visit the Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent to understand a Vaccarello dress?Vaccarello made some connections blatant \u2014 a YSL logo is fairly unmistakable \u2014 but few would dissect his dresses into the collaged components he referenced, and relate them back to Saint Laurent\u2019s heritage. Nor do they need to in order to enjoy wearing them. It\u2019s the opposite of Yves Saint Laurent's distinguished cadre of haute couture clients, whose intelligence and culture were, supposedly, reflected in the choice of garments on their backs. They could read Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s references \u2014 to Cubism, to Shakespeare \u2014 and appreciate the sentiments.\u201cI think it\u2019s not about changing identity,\u201d Vaccarello says of his role at Saint Laurent. \u201cIt\u2019s about making it for now.\u201d Maybe this is a whole new approach to fashion, in the digital age of constant distractions. The history\u2019s there, if you want to remember it.But, to paraphrase Proust, you\u2019ll only find those lost times if you search for them.An earlier version of this article included outdated information about Anthony Vacarello\u2019s design plans in his new role at Saint Laurent. After this article had gone to press, Saint Laurent announced it would show some men\u2019s designs alongside women\u2019s in their February 2017 Paris show.Advertisement"}

If the spirits can persuade this boy to undertake his rightful departure to the Other Side, they might be saved as well. It will be a long night.The souls crowd around this uncanny child. As the cast grows, so does our perspective; the novel\u2019s concerns expand, and we see this human business as an angel does, looking down. In the midst of the Civil War, saying farewell to one son foreshadows all those impending farewells to sons, the hundreds of thousands of those who will fall in the battlefields. The stakes grow, from our heavenly vantage, for we are talking about not just the ghostly residents of a few acres, but the citizens of a nation \u2014 in the graveyard\u2019s slaves and slavers, drunkards and priests, soldiers of doomed regiments, suicides and virgins, are assembled a country. The wretched and the brave, and such is Saunders\u2019s magnificent portraiture that readers will recognize in this wretchedness and bravery aspects of their own characters as well. He has gathered \u201csweet fools\u201d here, and we are counted among their number.Readers with conservative tastes may (foolishly) be put off by the novel\u2019s form \u2014 it is a kind of oral history, a collage built from a series of testimonies consisting of one line or three lines or a page and a half, some delivered by the novel\u2019s characters, some drawn from historical sources. The narrator is a curator, arranging disparate sources to assemble a linear story. It may take a few pages to get your footing, depending. The more limber won\u2019t be bothered. We\u2019ve had plenty of otherworldly choruses before, from Grover\u2019s Corners to Spoon River, and with so many walking dead in the pop culture nowadays, why not a corresponding increase in the talking dead? Are the nonfiction excerpts \u2014 from presidential historians, Lincoln biographers, Civil War chroniclers \u2014 real or fake? Who cares? Keep going, read the novel, Google later.Though I\u2019ve met George Saunders a few times, we\u2019re not buddy-buddy. I might lend him 10 bucks if he asked \u2014 I trust he\u2019s good for it \u2014 but given how rarely our paths cross I know it would be a while before I saw it again, and that\u2019s O.K. As with you, probably, I know him chiefly through his work, including \u201cPastoralia\u201d and \u201cCivilWarLand in Bad Decline,\u201d his satirical diagnoses of our post-post-modern condition: our theme park life, mass-produced existential writhings, the communal pig-wallow in the mud pits of consumerism. But if the historical theme park in \u201cCivilWarLand\u201d was a stage for its workers\u2019 ludicrous miseries, the war here is a crucible for a heroic American identity: fearful but unflagging; hopeful even in tragedy; staggering, however tentatively, toward a better world.Colson Whitehead\u2019s most recent novel, \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d won the National Book Award for fiction last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Headed for the Graveyard of Books", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuthor\u2019s NoteIt\u2019s a fine late-summer weekend just before Labor Day, and we\u2019ve come to the Inn at Shelburne Farms, a charming old estate on Lake Champlain, far from the book-glutted world of Manhattan. But not that far: Thanks to my \u201cstay connected whether you want to or not\u201d iPhone, I get updates at all hours of the day and night from Bookish, Goodreads and Lit Hub bannering the new Hot Titles. I can be out on a lake paddling my canoe, and up will pop the shortlist for the Man Booker Prize. If you\u2019re lounging in a rain-rotted Adirondack chair reading \u201cMrs. Dalloway\u201d on your Kindle, put it aside. The new Jodi Picoult is here.But for how long? Will the \u201clong-awaited\u201d books of 2016, the Ann Patchett and Margaret Atwood and Stephen King, be read in a hundred years? Does it matter? We want to read these authors now. They shine brightly in our cultural firmament. Still, I can\u2019t help brooding, as I drift through the inn\u2019s well-stocked library, about the evanescence of even these long-awaited books.It\u2019s an imposing room, stuffed with Victorian furniture and old lamps. Built by one of America\u2019s great fortunes \u2014 it was once the country estate of Cornelius Vanderbilt\u2019s granddaughter \u2014 it feels right out of an Edith Wharton novel. The Inn at Shelburne Farms belongs to a period when people had libraries, when reading was a central activity in life. It was how you got your information.I doubt the owners of these books read more than a few of them, but who am I to judge? Anatole France, asked if he had read all the books in his library, is said to have replied: \u201cNot one-tenth of them. I don\u2019t suppose you use your S\u00e8vres china every day?\u201d But they look as if they\u2019ve been perused if not exactly read. Bound in leather, their fading pages rough-cut and tissue-thin, they have no jackets; their titles and the names of their authors are stamped in gold leaf on the cover. They aren\u2019t just books; through the gentle weathering of time, they\u2019ve become objects of beauty.I take one down and cradle it gingerly in my hands: \u201cGeorge Eliot\u2019s Life as Related in Her Letters and Journals,\u201d by J.W. Cross. Cross was Eliot\u2019s husband, best known for having tried to commit suicide by leaping into the Grand Canal while on their honeymoon. It\u2019s illustrated with black-and-white etchings and has a musty old-book smell, as if it\u2019s been moldering for decades in a hot attic room. Yet when Cross\u2019s book was published in 1885, four years after Eliot\u2019s death, it was read and discussed by everyone who cared about (what was then) contemporary literature. Cross maintained a high profile: He defended his portrayal of Eliot\u2019s relationship with the philosopher Herbert Spencer, who insisted their affair had been platonic, and launched a futile effort to have Eliot buried in Westminster Abbey. \u201cCross did not fade away,\u201d Eliot\u2019s biographer Frederick Karl wryly noted: \u201cHe would do that later.\u201d Like everyone else.There\u2019s one shelf of new and sort-of-new books that includes John Updike\u2019s \u201cThe Music School,\u201d a collection of stories I read in 10th grade; Annie Proulx\u2019s \u201cThe Shipping News\u201d; and Karen Russell\u2019s \u201cSwamplandia!,\u201d the Hot Titles of 1966, 1993 and 2011. They\u2019re doomed, too; In the years to come, they\u2019ll lose their covers and their pristine pages will turn brittle. Their authors\u2019 names will be forgotten. Literary immortality is an illusion. What does it mean for a book to \u201clast\u201d? Last for how long? A few decades at best.But is that really why we write? I published my first book, a biography of Delmore Schwartz, almost 40 years ago. It, too, will soon begin its long journey to oblivion. I can imagine the stages: from that fabled used-books emporium the Strand to the remainder shelf of a secondhand book shop in a Maine resort town to the \u201cde-acquisition\u201d bin of a public library in Iowa to the bookshelves, if I\u2019m lucky, of a country inn.Is that such an ignominious fate? I didn\u2019t write my books for posterity (not that posterity would have cared): I wrote them for myself. Which doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t hunger for readers and fame. I never could have endured so much hard, solitary labor without the prospect of an audience. But this graveyard of dead books doesn\u2019t unnerve me. It reminds me that I had a deeper motive, one that only the approach of old age and death has unlocked. I wrote to answer questions I had \u2014 the motive of all art, whatever its ostensible subject. There were things I urgently needed to know. Why did Schwartz, the most promising poet of his generation, end up dying at the age of 52 in a fleabag hotel in Midtown Manhattan? Why did my next (and last) biographical subject, Saul Bellow, tear up his life to feed his fiction, marrying five times, tormenting himself and others, finding in his self-inflicted suffering the elixir of his art? And what traumas buried within myself was I trying to unearth by spending decades on their stories? It wasn\u2019t the hope of immortality that goaded me to write: It was obsession.It would be nice to think that some visitor to the Inn at Shelburne Farms might come across one of my books a century from now and flip through a few pages before reshelving it. Or even be inspired to order it from AbeBooks or read it on Google or \u2014 who knows what lies in store? \u2014 absorb it through a book chip implanted in the brain. Delmore redivivus! But that was never the point.James Atlas is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Shadow in the Garden: A Biographer\u2019s Tale.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Verizon Will Pay $350 Million Less for Yahoo", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Verizon store in Chicago. Verizon will pay $4.48 billion for Yahoo, about $350 million less than it initially offered after security breaches that were disclosed last year.The revised agreement, now valued at $4.48 billion, paves the way for the deal to proceed to a shareholder vote as early as April, although securities regulators are still assessing how Yahoo disclosed information about the breaches to investors. Yahoo, which is winding down its own investigation of the breaches, will share more details about the incidents and their impact in the next few weeks when it makes required regulatory filings.Consummation of the sale to Verizon would bring closure to a negotiation that has stretched on for nearly three years as Yahoo\u2019s board and its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, considered various plans to separate the company\u2019s fading internet businesses from its much more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group.Verizon and Yahoo, whose internet advertising businesses are tiny compared with juggernauts like Google and Facebook, are eager to move forward on integrating their internet operations.\u201cWe have always believed this acquisition makes strategic sense,\u201d Marni M. Walden, the Verizon executive vice president who oversees product innovation and new businesses, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to moving ahead expeditiously so that we can quickly welcome Yahoo\u2019s tremendous talent and assets into our expanding portfolio in the digital advertising space.\u201dVerizon intends to keep the Yahoo brand separate from AOL, another internet pioneer that it acquired in 2015. But executives hope to use digital advertising technology and a unified sales force to court advertisers who want to reach the companies\u2019 combined audience of well over one billion active internet users.Yahoo still attracts large audiences to its sports, news and financial sites, and its email service retains a loyal audience. Although Yahoo and AOL do not carry the clout they had during the early days of the web, marketers do want to preserve alternatives to Google and Facebook, which increasingly dominate digital advertising.It\u2019s unclear whether Ms. Mayer, a former Google executive who was hired as Yahoo\u2019s chief in 2012, will remain with Verizon after the deal closes. Ms. Mayer failed to turn around Yahoo\u2019s struggling internet businesses and was forced to write off much of the value of Tumblr, her biggest acquisition.After the sale, Yahoo\u2019s Asian investments will remain in a stub company, called Altaba, which will study how to extract the maximum value from them. The Alibaba stake has a face value of about $39 billion and the Yahoo Japan stake is worth about $9 billion, but any transactions to dispose of the shares are likely to incur multibillion-dollar tax bills.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Elegy for the Library", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThe occupants of the small reading room are all middle-age men poring over newspapers in at least three languages. The ceiling fans whir. Pages rustle. Not one man is looking at his phone. Overhead a framed poster features a paraphrase of a line from the novelist Neil Gaiman: \u201cGoogle can bring you 100,000 answers but a librarian can bring you the right one.\u201d Fighting words.In the larger reading room the crowd is mixed. An elderly woman looks up from her notebook; a lanky boy is mouthing the words he reads. Every seat is occupied, and I wander between the stacks: Astronomy, Home Economics, Satire in Kannada Literature.Every so often, there are rumblings, among students gathered on the front steps or in the local press, that the library will close: the predatory gaze of developers is never far. And I\u2019m more conscious than ever of the many things we would lose.Wherever I\u2019ve lived, I\u2019ve used the library. When I was growing up in Nairobi, Kenya, I would sometimes go to a tiny community library run by a church organization. It was a stronghold of stalwarts; there were hardly ever any new faces. The dust was thick. Branches of a jacaranda tree pressed against the single large window. The place had a vaguely medicinal smell, as though along with tonic for the mind, it administered tinctures and liniments.One evening a few minutes before closing, the librarian and I were packing up at the same time. He glanced over at one of my books and did a cinematic double take.\u201cThat\u2019s not from this library?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo, it\u2019s mine,\u201d I said, telling the truth but sounding cagey. I was in early adolescence, and everything I said seemed like an admission of guilt.\u201cI\u2019m reading it too,\u201d he said, whipping out his own copy.It was the same edition of Iris Murdoch\u2019s \u201cA Word Child.\u201d Its cover even seemed to have the same fold as mine in the right-hand corner.I looked at my copy for a few seconds and put it in my bag. I felt a sudden rush to the head: After years of longing to leave childhood behind, it felt as though I had finally become an adult.In later years, I would sometimes go to a library in North London, a drab hulk of a building where I became friendly with one of the chattier librarians. Ms. R. was a middle-age woman with close-cropped hair and scarlet fingernails that flipped absently through the cards of her Rolodex.\u201cOh, that Hemingway,\u201d she would say. \u201cAnd Scott Fitzgerald. Such drinkers. They\u2019d drink you out of house and home. It\u2019s amazing they were ever clearheaded enough to plan a novel.\u201dShe would describe Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Cornish home in detail, as though they spent summers there together.Ms. R. favored dangly earrings, often of sea creatures \u2014 gold crabs, diving dolphins \u2014 and I came to associate their dainty glamour with the stories she told.She once handed me a copy of \u201cWide Sargasso Sea,\u201d while describing Jean Rhys\u2019s bohemian life in Paris.\u201cHer book is much better than \u2018Jane Eyre,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. R.\u2019s anecdotes bridged the gap between those semi-mythical beings with great imaginative powers and we ordinary individuals who borrowed their books from libraries. Authors may have had spells of adventure and excess, but they weren\u2019t that different from the people around me, after all: They also fought with their spouses, worried about money, cheated and lied, and then mowed the lawn. If they had got it into their heads that they would write, maybe some of us could, too.Today I do write, and as I drift around the central library in Mysore, that still seems like a bit of a miracle. At Botany and Horticulture, a woman is dusting old volumes with the vigor normally reserved for beating carpets. The prim, desiccated formality associated with libraries is absent here. On the other side of the bookcase, a woman dozes on a stool, a mop clutched in one hand.Once, as I wandered past her office enquiringly, the librarian, H.N. Poornima, beckoned me in. We chatted about the books that were most in demand, and I told her that I was surprised by the large number of shelves of Kannada poetry.\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said, \u201cpoetry is very popular with housewives.\u201d\u201cDo you think the library is in danger of closing down?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo chance.\u201dThe library has 28 branches around the city, in addition to a few reading rooms at community organizations. Ms. Poornima tells me each branch regularly orders books at readers\u2019 request from the state\u2019s central library system.Computers are much too costly for many families. Even books remain out of reach. The library\u2019s website lists \u201cuninterrupted lighting\u201d as one of its services \u2014 a real draw in a city that suffers from frequent power cutoffs. This is a place of refuge. It offers a respite from the heat, from office life, from noisy households, from all the irritations that crowd in.It also offers the intangible entanglements of a common space. One of my favorite descriptions of the public library comes from the journalist and academic Sophie Mayer, who has called it \u201cthe ideal model of society, the best possible shared space,\u201d because there \u201ceach person is pursuing their own aim (education, entertainment, affect, rest) with respect to others, through the best possible medium of the transmission of ideas, feelings and knowledge \u2014 the book.\u201dLibraries may have their idiosyncrasies, but the fundamentals of their ecosystem are universal. They are places of long breaks, of boredom and reverie, of solace and deliberation. They offer opportunities for unobtrusive observation, stolen glances and frissons, anticipation and nudging possibilities. And when the sensible realization strikes that a thrilling plan is better left unaccomplished, they might also become sites of abandonment.I once discovered a gorgeously caustic letter of resignation on a library desk, unsigned and presumably unsent. I can\u2019t remember now what words it used, but I remember leaving it where I\u2019d found it so that as many patrons as possible could enjoy its fruitiness.As I read of libraries closing around the world, I worry that these ideal models of society will soon recede into sepia. Mysore\u2019s City Central Library, where every seat is occupied, may one day exist solely as images in a database.And it\u2019d be my fault, too. A little bit.You see, I have a confession to make. About a month ago, I came upon a book on one of my shelves that I hadn\u2019t spotted for years. It was a copy of Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac\u2019s \u201cTh\u00e9r\u00e8se\u201d in English. When I opened it, the slip on the inside cover told me that I had borrowed it from the library of my school in Nairobi on March 2, 1991. It was due back 14 days from that date. I felt a little sick. I couldn\u2019t even remember if I had read it.I mailed the book back with a letter of apology and a donation to the school alumni fund. But surely further penance was required \u2014 some expression of how much I valued every library I had ever spent time in, every librarian who had told me a salty anecdote, every book I had signed out. Well, here it is.Mahesh Rao is the author of \u201cThe Smoke is Rising\u201d and \u201cOne Point Two Billion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Global Expansion, Netflix Makes Friends With Carriers", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs he sat in his office in central Paris, Christian Bombrun, an executive at Orange, the French cellphone and cable operator, got an unexpected call. It was Netflix, the American streaming giant, proposing a deal.Netflix was looking to offer its stable of movies and television programming to the 10 million Orange customers across France. What followed were six months of often tense negotiations, as both companies wrestled over the details.\u201cThere were some difficult discussions,\u201d said Mr. Bombrun, director of entertainment and digital services for Orange in France. At certain points, both sides thought the talks would fail. But in the end, he said, \u201cwe got a deal done.\u201dThe company\u2019s partnerships with cable and cellphone operators worldwide give it almost instantaneous access to potential new users without having to spend a fortune on advertising and distribution deals in markets where its brand and content are often still relatively unknown.This growing symbiotic relationship will take center stage on Monday when Reed Hastings, the company\u2019s chief executive, gives the keynote address on the first day of the Mobile World Congress. The conference is an annual trade show in Barcelona, Spain, where executives from across the telecom, media and technology worlds gather to meet and, potentially, sign new deals.Mr. Hastings\u2019s headline act \u2014 part sales pitch, part industry update \u2014 comes as Netflix\u2019s attention has increasingly turned to its overseas subscribers.The Orange deal, one of Netflix\u2019s first international partnerships, is a case in point.But the talks were not all smooth sailing.Along with the typical back-and-forth about how much revenue each side would receive from the deal, Orange was concerned that Netflix, whose European headquarters are in Amsterdam, had not signed on to French rules requiring online video distributors to fund local-language content.St\u00e9phane Richard, the company\u2019s chief executive, also had said he would not work with Netflix, fearful that Orange would become a \u201cTrojan horse,\u201d potentially helping the streaming service gain a global following, only to then cast Orange aside.But for cable and cellphone companies from Bulgaria to Bolivia, the calculation is simple. Though many of them initially resisted such deals with online content providers, gaining access to Netflix\u2019s exclusive programming helps set them apart from local rivals, just as customers\u2019 online habits have shifted toward video, particularly on their smartphones and other mobile devices.\u201cNetflix wants to be exposed to as many people as it can,\u201d said Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders Analysis, a media and telecom industry research company in London. \u201cTelecom operators want to keep people inside their walls, so they are willing to let Netflix in.\u201dNetflix\u2019s American revenue, $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, still constitutes a majority of its sales. But after a somewhat stuttering start to its global expansion, its international revenue is quickly catching up, hitting almost a billion dollars in the three months through December.Even Netflix\u2019s senior executives equate much of that growth to the company\u2019s strengthened ties with cable and cellphone operators around the globe.Such bonhomie between Netflix and carriers is a relatively recent phenomenon, and there are still teething pains whenever the company wades into international markets.Overseas, Sky, the British content and cable provider, has refused to include Netflix on its own set-top box, primarily because it views the streaming service as a direct competitor to its own original programming.Analysts say many operators, even those that have signed partnership deals, still fret that Netflix \u2014 alongside other American tech giants like Google and Facebook \u2014 will benefit more from these relationships than they will. Avid television watchers, for instance, have invested emotional capital into popular Netflix shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cNarcos,\u201d and often view their cable provider as a mere conduit to watching such digital content.\u201cNetflix\u2019s exclusive shows are dominating people\u2019s water cooler moments,\u201d said Tony Gunnarsson, a senior analyst at Ovum, a technology research firm, in London. \u201cConsumers are already watching Netflix, so it\u2019s better for operators to add Netflix to their services or people will go elsewhere.\u201dFor Bob Greene, managing director of online entertainment at Liberty Global, a cable giant controlled by the billionaire John C. Malone, his relationship with Netflix is rooted in the new realities of how people watch content online.At first, Mr. Greene said, Liberty Global limited the partnership to Britain, including the Netflix app on its cable service but keeping billing separate. (It takes an undisclosed of percentage of revenue from its subscribers signing up to Netflix.)Yet as Liberty Global crunched the numbers, it realized that its British customers who watched Netflix were less likely to jump to rival products and showed more loyalty to its own services.\u201cIf our customers want Netflix and we don\u2019t offer it, they\u2019ll find another way to get it,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cWe\u2019re better off if they don\u2019t have to go elsewhere to find what they want.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324.For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent.No longer.Nearly 100 technology companies said that President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries would violate both immigration law and the United States Constitution.\u201cSilicon Valley is stepping up,\u201d said Sam Altman, who runs the valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, Y Combinator. \u201cThe companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don\u2019t support.\u201dIt is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage.

Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,\u201d said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey all have the same leanings.\u201dMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google\u2019s former slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is the most forceful expression of this.\u201cIf you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,\u201d Mr. Shotts said.Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards,\u201d and saying it would create \u201cmuch collateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dThe immigration battle is in Microsoft\u2019s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\u201cIn 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,\u201d said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. \u201cThe most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.\u201dMr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous \u201cfor the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren\u2019t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can\u2019t fix the monetization of fake news.\u201dPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.\u201cI\u2019ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,\u201d said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.He talked about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which asks women, \u201cWhat would you do if you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201d Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women\u2019s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.\u201cWe have to protest in public,\u201d he said. The event raised $30,000 for the legal aid groups.\u201cIt looked like two-thirds of the room were newcomers,\u201d Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement.\u201cI want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re pushing at least as hard as Trump is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Chief Taps Into the \u2018Right Now\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were undergraduates at Stanford University, they made an unconventional observation about what makes a social network valuable.Thanks to the rise of Facebook, most everyone believed that networks became exponentially more valuable by amassing more users. But Mr. Spiegel noticed that in real life, even people with thousands of acquaintances spent most of their time with just a few friends whose value outweighed a large number of looser ties.While online identity previously emphasized everything anyone has ever done, with Snapchat \u201cmy identity is who I am right now,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said in a 2015 video to describe the app.Along with financial information, Mr. Spiegel is expected to include remarks about Snap\u2019s mission that will showcase his zag-while-zigging philosophy.\u201cIf you want to understand Snap, look at Evan Spiegel,\u201d said Todd Chaffee, a partner at IVP, one of Snap\u2019s three largest venture capital investors. \u201cHe is the visionary who drives that company.\u201dMary Ritti, a spokeswoman for Snap, declined to comment for this story.Mr. Spiegel grew up in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy Los Angeles suburb, and attended Crossroads, a prep school in Santa Monica that counts Jonah Hill, Kate Hudson and Jack Black as alumni.He lived a privileged life, with expensive cars, exclusive club memberships and fancy vacations, according to records from his parents\u2019 divorce proceedings. His father, John Spiegel, a securities lawyer who helped overhaul the Los Angeles Police Department after the Rodney King beating in 1991, also had his children volunteer and build homes in poor areas of Mexico.While many techies talk about how the industry is a meritocracy, Mr. Spiegel has not shied from his wealthy roots. In public comments, he has said he is \u201ca young, white, educated male who got really, really lucky. And life isn\u2019t fair.\u201dAt Stanford, also his father\u2019s alma mater, Mr. Spiegel majored in product design and started a handful of companies with Mr. Murphy, a fellow Kappa Sigma fraternity brother. (Their early start-ups flopped.) There, Mr. Spiegel also met some of the men who would become his mentors, including Scott Cook, then the chief executive of Intuit, and Eric Schmidt, the Google chairman, who taught an M.B.A. class that he attended.Mr. Spiegel \u201creally is the next Gates or Zuckerberg,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said in an interview, comparing the Snap chief to Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, Bill Gates, and Facebook\u2019s chief, Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cHe has superb manners, which he says he got from his mother. He credits his father\u2019s long legal calls, which he overheard, to giving him perspective on business and structure as a very young man.\u201dWhen Snapchat started taking off, Mr. Spiegel did not wait to graduate from Stanford. He moved the company to the Venice Beach boardwalk, away from what he perceived as Silicon Valley\u2019s too-narrow focus on technology.When Mr. Spiegel met Institutional Venture Partners to discuss possible fund-raising, for example, he told IVP\u2019s partner, Dennis Phelps, that he was unwilling to accept the firm\u2019s standard investment terms.\u201cHe\u2019s different from most tech people because he knows what\u2019s cool and what\u2019s next,\u201d said Ryan Wilson, an artist in Los Angeles who goes by the name ThankYouX. He worked with Mr. Spiegel on a piece of art for one of Snapchat\u2019s offices. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like things because a dealer says he should. He just likes what he likes, whether it\u2019s made by a high school friend or a famous artist.\u201dMr. Spiegel has also involved himself in some political conversations. In 2015, he met with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, as a member of the 21st Century Council at the Berggruen Institute. Its founder, Nicolas Berggruen, said he impressed a group that includes Mohamed El-Erian, the economist, and former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with his \u201cthoughtful and mature approach to people.\u201d Last fall, Mr. Spiegel also attended a private dinner with John O. Brennan, then the director of the C.I.A. According to multiple attendees, Mr. Spiegel listened more than he spoke and had the ear of Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles.Mr. Spiegel\u2019s unconventional streak may be most evident in how he has steered Snap. He has long said that a public offering was what was best for the company and its investors, even as other tech start-ups chose to stay private as long as possible.Since Snapchat\u2019s debut, the app and the company have also undergone dozens of changes that were criticized for being too different from other consumer internet companies.Mr. Spiegel rejected the idea of a newsfeed in Snapchat\u2019s app, for example, because he said people prefer stories chronologically. In Facebook\u2019s News Feed, posts are reverse chronological, meaning the newest posts are at the top.Unlike other social networks, Snapchat also does not use algorithms to push people to see certain content. Snapchat users swipe their screens to navigate and view video vertically, rather than tap on menus or turn their phones to watch videos horizontally.\u201cFrom what I can figure out, he thinks differently about the way to monetize and develop a social network,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said of Mr. Spiegel.Investors who buy into Snap\u2019s initial public offering will soon be getting a piece of that approach.Allowing \u201courselves to be pulled in another direction\u201d is what makes us human, Mr. Spiegel said in a commencement speech at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business in 2015. Quoting John F. Kennedy, he added, \u201cConformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Snap\u2019s I.P.O., Los Angeles Prepares to Embrace New Tech Millionaires", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Blaine Lourd has long helped the movie stars, professional athletes and heiresses in Los Angeles manage their wealth. Over the past few years, he has also noticed millionaires who made their money in technology begin to dot the west side of the city.\u201cWhat we have not had is our Google moment,\u201d Mr. Lourd said, referring to Google\u2019s initial public offering in 2004, which produced a horde of new millionaires in Silicon Valley.That prospect has Angeleno real estate agents, money managers and luxury goods purveyors excited for a potential business windfall, akin to what their Silicon Valley brethren 375 miles to the north have seen time and again with tech I.P.O.s.\u201cWhen it comes to tech companies, for the wealth managers and real estate guys, no one has really rung the register like the Snap thing that\u2019s about to happen\u201d to Los Angeles, said Mr. Lourd, whose wealth management firm, LourdMurray, is based in Beverly Hills. \u201cMy theme is that Snapchat is the moment.\u201dTo capture some of these soon-to-be wealthy techies, Los Angeles real estate agents, lawyers and wealth managers have bought targeted search and Facebook ads, they said. Others are trying to spread word of their services through their networks of contacts. Tech employees are feeling the effects \u2014 some said they had been bombarded with LinkedIn messages from companies that find clients for these service providers.\u201cIt will be amazing to see the tech industry take off,\u201d said Lee LeGrande, a residential real estate agent at LeGrande Beach Homes, which sells property in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach. In anticipation of new money from Snap workers and Silicon Valley techies, he said, he is building some luxury beach homes.\u201cWhen Snap goes public, I hope people see these towns are hard to beat for proximity to LAX and the clean beach,\u201d he said.Snap is trying to help its 1,900 employees prepare for the scrum for their money. One Snap employee, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential, said the company had discussed bringing in academics from Stanford University to explain the impact that the I.P.O. could have on their lives. Google used a similar strategy for its employees when it went public.A spokeswoman for Snap declined to comment.In the meantime, wealth managers and others are preparing their advice. Howard Rowen, a financial adviser at Bank of America in Los Angeles who manages money for entrepreneurs and tech workers, said techies who made fortunes at a start-up might think they would hit the jackpot again. Instead, he said, that often doesn\u2019t happen and coders, engineers and others should regard the I.P.O. as a once-in-a-lifetime event.They should also diversify their assets, Mr. Rowen said. \u201cEntrepreneurs have strong emotional ties to their companies and their stock, but things don\u2019t always go right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince them that they need to invest in something other than their own company.\u201dSnap has already changed the face of Venice, a once bohemian beachside section of Greater Los Angeles. When Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy moved Snap to the area in 2013, they put the company in a single beach bungalow near the Venice Beach boardwalk. Now Snap\u2019s employees have more than tripled from 600 people at the end of 2015, and the company owns and leases several buildings tucked discreetly amid shops and homes.Venice, once home to mom-and-pop shops and dive bars, is now home to $9 juice bottles from Kreation Kafe and a $7 slice of toast with ricotta and jam at Superba Food & Bread. Upscale clothing and home goods stores dot the main commercial drag.Property values have risen 13 percent over the past year, according to the property website Trulia, with the average price per square foot for a home at $1,257 \u2014 higher than San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, also a tech enclave, and comparable to Palo Alto in Silicon Valley.Venture capitalists from Silicon Valley firms like Institutional Venture Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners are regularly spotted with entrepreneurs around Venice. Google and Facebook have moved in, turning industrial lots into campuses in nearby Playa del Rey.\u201cSouthern California now has more venture capital and angel investors than it has ever had before,\u201d said Mr. Rowen, the financial adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s not Northern California, but there is a real phenomenon.\u201dThe Snap public offering portends future wealth for venture investors in Los Angeles as well.\u201cThe next three to five years will be an absolute renaissance,\u201d said Mark Suster, the founder of Upfront Ventures, a venture capital firm in Santa Monica.Given events like Snap\u2019s I.P.O., \u201cwe\u2019ll see those employees recycle their capital back into the ecosystem,\u201d he added. \u201cThere will be an explosion of start-ups.\u201dNoting that Silicon Valley venture investors have long held Los Angeles in low regard, Mr. Suster said more were coming south. \u201cThere is a lot of money flowing into the community,\u201d he said.Not everyone is happy with the changes. Gentrification has pushed artists and working families out of Venice. Some restaurants have shut down because they can no longer pay soaring rents. In response, some politicians and residents in Venice have pushed for density restrictions, said Emil Schneeman, a real estate agent at Berkshire Hathaway Home Services.How much the wealth from a Snap I.P.O. will trickle out across broader Los Angeles is harder to ascertain. The city has long been a destination for the rich and famous and is flush with cash from the entertainment and banking industries.But it is still an exciting time for the people who can help Snap employees spend and invest.\u201cThe real estate guys are pumped because the first thing people usually buy is a house, or a dream home,\u201d Mr. Lourd said. \u201cThis is a good environment to be working in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That equates to more than 600 million devices, from smartphones to traditional computers.By using software to block digital advertising, critics say, users are breaking an unwritten pact with websites and digital publishers, many of which generate the bulk of their revenue from these ads.Yet industry watchers say such ad-blocking digital tools have garnered a mainstream following, particularly across the developing world where their use in countries like Indonesia has already reached roughly two-thirds of the internet population.\u201cThere\u2019s been a massive surge of mobile ad-blockers in these countries that no one anticipated,\u201d said Sean Blanchfield, chief executive of PageFair. \u201cIn the West, I expect the same trend to blindside us in the very near future.\u201dThis rise of ad blockers has not gone unnoticed by the advertising industry.\u201cAd blocking is a detriment to the entire advertising ecosystem,\u201d Paul Verna, an analyst at the research firm eMarketer, said in a statement. \u201cThe best way for the industry to tackle this problem is to deliver compelling ad experiences that consumers won\u2019t want to block.\u201dAcross the developing world, ad-blocking software is primarily used by people to save on often costly data packages by removing video and other data-hungry advertisements from mobile websites.More than 90 percent of all ad-blocking on mobile devices worldwide still takes place in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the PageFair report. And last year, such software was used on 380 million smartphones and tablets around the globe, a 39 percent yearly increase.In contrast, the vast majority of ad-blocking on traditional computers, whose use similarly jumped 17 percent last year, to 236 million devices, is still restricted mainly to the United States and Europe. In those regions, people\u2019s efforts to block malware disguised as online advertising has been the main motivation for downloading ad blockers.\u201cIn the U.S., ad-blocking on mobile is slightly immature,\u201d Mr. Blanchfield said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt that people\u2019s use of it will skyrocket.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Has Arrived in the Art World. Now What?", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the world outside looks frightful, you might be tempted to put on the blinders.The accelerating development of virtual reality technology \u2014 which lets you escape into another world through a blackout headset \u2014 is finally rumbling the art world, always more skeptical than cinema and television about new technologies. A new generation of artists is beginning to produce virtual-reality artworks \u2014 some for display in galleries, others freely accessible online \u2014 that plunge viewers into fully articulated spaces. Forget contemplative distance; say goodbye to Brechtian alienation. In these works, immersion is all.Ms. Rossin\u2019s obscure figures and cynical voice-overs find an echo in \u201cTransdimensional Serpent,\u201d by the virtual reality veteran Jon Rafman, which places you amid white humanoids, satyrs and snakes in an empty space, a forest, and a ruined interior.Mr. Couillard has also devised video games in the past, and many artists using virtual reality seem closer to game designers or cinematic animators than to painters or sculptors. What\u2019s unexpected, therefore, is that so few of the virtual reality artworks I\u2019ve seen really require its immersive capabilities. All of the projects in \u201cFirst Look\u201d can be streamed both in stereoscopic form, to be seen through the goggles, or as flat images, to be watched on your phone\u2019s screen, and the difference is often negligible.What works for video game designers may be less applicable for fine artists, for whom the creation of images is supposed to be a means to something larger, and not an end in itself. That was the great lesson of modernism: Art is more than mere illusion, and it gains further meaning by pushing media to the limits of their capabilities. Virtual reality, by contrast, is a medium without limits \u2014 a medium that tries to parallel life itself. The wonder I felt when I first put on an Oculus Rift, and lost myself in Mr. Steegman Mangran\u00e9\u2019s rain forest or Ms. Rossin\u2019s floating world, is undeniable. Now the challenge is to put virtual reality in the service of something more complex, for it would be a pity if wonder was all we got.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Here Is How to Fend Off a Hijacking of Home Devices", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixMODERN homes today are getting internet-connected light bulbs, thermostats, TVs and speakers. So with a simple voice command or the touch of a button on our smartphones, we can set the temperature, turn on a light or prepare the TV to record a program.What could go wrong?As smart home devices become more popular, they will become bigger targets for hackers. So it behooves us to get ahead of the curve by securing our home appliances, using these tips from security experts who have closely studied smart home accessories.When shopping for an internet-connected home device like a smart speaker, lighting system or television set, a good rule of thumb is to go with a trusted brand.People should also carefully read company privacy policies. David Britton, a vice president in the fraud and identity department of Experian, the credit reporting agency, said people should be curious about whether companies themselves were a threat to user privacy.\u201cWhat are they capturing about you?\u201d he said. \u201cIs the data leaving the device? Is it being sent back to the mother ship?\u201dConsider the smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Amazon said its Alexa smart assistant, which is used in its Echo speakers, automatically downloads software updates to defend against new security threats. Data from the Echo is also uploaded to Amazon\u2019s servers only after people utter the wake word \u201cAlexa,\u201d the company said. That minimizes the likelihood that the device will record conversations unrelated to requests intended for Alexa.Google said its Home speaker similarly issued regular software updates and employed advanced security features, like a technique that disables the device if its software is tampered with. The company added that the speaker processed speech only after the words \u201cO.K. Google\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d were detected.Your Wi-Fi network is the pulse of your smart home, thus it is a vulnerable attack point. Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene suggest connecting all your smart home accessories \u2014 for example, your Amazon Echo, Nest thermostat, Samsung smart refrigerator and Philips Hue smart lights \u2014 onto a Wi-Fi network that is separate from the one connected to your computing devices, like your smartphone, tablet and computer.With two distinct Wi-Fi networks, it will be harder for a hacker to jump from infiltrating your smart accessory on one network to a personal computer on the other network, Mr. Arsene said.If you are paranoid about your Wi-Fi network being hacked, you can also change the Wi-Fi router\u2019s network settings to disable broadcasting the network name entirely, Mr. Britton said. That would make it difficult for a hacker driving by to detect and compromise your network, though it would also require house guests to manually type in your network name and password when they log on to your Wi-Fi.The same security principles for websites apply to the so-called internet of things. You should set strong, unique passwords for logging into each device you own. If you recycle your passwords and one device is compromised, the others can be, too.A strong password can be a random string of characters or a nonsensical phrase with numbers and special characters. (Examples: My favorite number is Green4782# or The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%.)While reputable manufacturers of smart home accessories offer software updates to patch security vulnerabilities, it is often up to the consumer to stay on top of updates. Because it lacks a screen, a smart light bulb or an internet-connected power socket is going to have a tough time informing you that it needs a software update.Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene recommend that consumers regularly log into the mobile apps or websites for their smart home accessories to check if they need software updates. If updates are available, install them immediately.With smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, there is an equivalent: a mute button to disable the device microphone so it can no longer listen. In the unlikely event that a device is hijacked, muting the microphone could help prevent hackers from listening to your conversations, Mr. Britton said.Or you could go the safest route and opt out of having these devices at all. That was the method chosen by Mr. Tien, the lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who previously studied the privacy risks of smart meters, the devices that utility companies use to monitor energy consumption.He said he accepted the privacy implications of owning a smartphone, but a smart home accessory?\u201cI think it\u2019s sort of asking to have your privacy invaded to have something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the value of it is really all that great.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Minimize the Misery of Mug Shots", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HagglerThe Haggler has a spotless criminal record. Of course, that is because the Haggler is a fictional construct, which means he has no wrists, and this makes him impossible to handcuff. Here we have a key difference between the Haggler and the bumbling nitwit whose name is affixed to this column. He has wrists. Has he ever been arrested? Nobody cares. And the Haggler doesn\u2019t know because he and the nitwit are barely on speaking terms.Forgive the snippy tone, dear readers, but many of you keep confusing the Haggler with the nitwit, and it is starting to grate.But inevitably, the sites have figured out ways around Google\u2019s changes. Unfortunately, Google now seems a step behind.Q. A mug-shot website called Bail Bond City, got hold of a nonaccident misdemeanor D.U.I. arrest I had nearly 30 years ago, and now it\u2019s one of the first entries to come up if my name is searched on Google. (It doesn\u2019t appear at all under Bing or Yahoo.) The site claims that it is \u201cfully ad supported,\u201d but click on any of the listings, and you\u2019re bounced to an \u201cerase mug shots\u201d site that charges for deletions.It\u2019s hard to believe that Google wants these unscrupulous sites to wreck the online reputation of thousands of people. Maybe it is time for you to nudge the company into action again.Name Withheld, Ditto, HometownA. According to the Florida division of corporations and domain name records, Bail Bond City is owned by Kyle Grant 1 LLC, which owns a handful of other bail-related sites, including orangecountyflbail.com and orlandobondsmen.com. (Neither site is functioning.) For reasons that may remain a mystery, the LLC also owns fatpeoplehate.com and trophywifefitness.com. How exactly those two were intended to make money is not clear. Those sites aren\u2019t working either.Mr. Grant\u2019s brother, Travis Paul Grant, is listed on records for Kyle Grant 1 LLC. Exactly how the brothers split Bail Bond City duties is unclear and not something the Haggler can illuminate. The brothers Grant did not respond to emails or phone messages, though, honestly, the Haggler isn\u2019t sure what he would have said had they been in touch: \u201cUh, could you guys find something else to do? Really, any other job would be better.\u201dThe Haggler knows this is a challenge. There are legitimate sites that host mug shots, including those related to law enforcement, not to mention a lot of newspapers. The trick is finding a way to punish sites that charge to delete an image and then making adjustments as those sites attempt to escape whatever filter Google has devised.The Haggler contacted Google in mid-December, asking if the company would revisit the mug-shot issue. Kara Stockton, a spokeswoman, responded soon after, but it was more than a month before she provided a statement. Here\u2019s the whole thing:\u201cWe continue to refresh the algorithm and we\u2019re always making improvements to our search algorithms to keep up with the constantly evolving web.\u201dThe Haggler appreciates that Google can\u2019t share details, for the same reason that an army can\u2019t announce its strategy before an attack. Happily, though, the company\u2019s latest counterassault seems to be working. The guy who alerted the Haggler about Bail Bond City emailed recently to say that when his name is searched on Google, his mug shot no longer appears as the second result, as had long been true. It is not even on the first page.It is on the second page, which is not a bad start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Cousin Develops Technology to Flag Toxic Online Comments", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 From self-driving cars to multi-language translation, machine learning is underpinning many of the technology industry\u2019s biggest advances with its form of artificial intelligence.Now, Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, says it plans to apply machine learning technology to promote more civil discourse on the internet and make comment sections on sites a little less awful.Jigsaw, a technology incubator within Alphabet, says it has developed a new tool for web publishers to identify toxic comments that can undermine a civil exchange of ideas. Starting Thursday, publishers can start applying for access to use Jigsaw\u2019s software, called Perspective, without charge.\u201cWe have more information and more articles than any other time in history, and yet the toxicity of the conversations that follow those articles are driving people away from the conversation,\u201d said Jared Cohen, president of Jigsaw, formerly known as Google Ideas.With machine learning, a computer system is programmed to learn from repetition. It takes in training data \u2014 essentially, example after example \u2014 until it is familiar enough to anticipate with a high degree of confidence the proper response.In this instance, Jigsaw had a team review hundreds of thousands of comments to identify the types of comments that might deter people from a conversation. Based on that data, Perspective provided a score from zero to 100 on how similar the new comments are to the ones identified as toxic.Jigsaw said it settled on the word toxic after finding that most reviewers shared views about what types of comments drive people away from a conversation. Opinions about what comments constituted, for example, a personal attack ranged widely.The same methodology is being provided to publishers, who could use the scores to have human moderators review comments only for responses that registered above a certain number, or allow a reader to filter out comments above a certain level of toxicity.Because this requires considerable labor and time, The Times allows commenting on only about 10 percent of its articles. The Times said in a statement last year that it made its comments archive available to Jigsaw to help develop the machine-learning algorithm running Perspective. Linda Zebian, a spokeswoman for the Times, declined to comment on Wednesday.Mr. Cohen said the technology was in its early stages and might flag some false positives, but he expected that it would become more accurate over time with access to a greater set of comments.Jigsaw, whose stated mission is to use technology to tackle \u201cgeopolitical challenges\u201d such as cybersecurity attacks and online censorship, said it also saw opportunities for its machine-learning software to identify comments that are off-topic or unsubstantial.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Modamani, a refugee from Syria, sought on Monday to prevent Facebook from allowing users to repost the image, or any altered version of it, after it repeatedly showed up in fake news reports linking him to terrorism.The trial, one of several notable cases against Facebook in Germany, highlights several basic legal questions, such as who is responsible for content posted by anonymous sources and whether people who repost text they did not write, or an image that someone else altered, can be held responsible for defamation. Concern over nationalist and populist propaganda, as well as fake news, is growing in the country ahead of a general election scheduled for September.Mr. Modamani, now 19, fled Syria for Germany in 2015 and was living in a Berlin shelter when Ms. Merkel came to visit in September of that year.The selfie that he took with the chancellor and posted to his Facebook page was widely shared on social media, and became an emblem of her immigration policy. But Ms. Merkel\u2019s stance on refugees has shaken her support and has helped propel the rise of the populist, far-right Alternative for Germany party.Mr. Modamani has filed for an injunction in a court in W\u00fcrzburg, in the southern German state of Bavaria, that would require Facebook to remove any content linking him to terrorism.Mr. Modamani\u2019s lawyer argued that his client would continue to be a victim of libel until Facebook used its algorithms to prevent the image from being reproduced.\u201cI want peace in my life,\u201d the teenager told reporters after the hearing. \u201cNot everyone believes that. Many people hate me, but all I did was take a selfie with Ms. Merkel.\u201dAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The social media giant says it is committed \u201cto meeting our obligations under German law in relation to content which is shared by people on our platform,\u201d and has removed images reported to the company by Mr. Modamani\u2019s lawyer.In opening remarks to the court, Mr. Jun argued that Facebook had the technical ability to delete the image and prevent any copies from being posted. Lawyers for the social network insisted that it had removed any images flagged as defamatory, and that it was up to users to inform them of such material.After nearly two hours of arguments, during which Mr. Jun called Facebook\u2019s argument that it could not find and remove every copy of the image \u201cridiculous,\u201d both sides rejected a suggestion by the judge that they settle the matter with Facebook paying damages without any further proceedings.Judge Volkmar Seipel said that the case raised questions about personal rights in the digital sphere that the law has not kept up with and that the court may not be in a position to answer. A ruling is expected on March 7.Critics say those efforts do not go far enough.This is far from the only legal challenge the social network faces in Europe.On Tuesday, an Irish court is set to decide whether Facebook misused Europeans\u2019 digital data by transferring it to the United States.Privacy advocates say Facebook broke European data protection rules by moving users\u2019 information across the Atlantic. The company denies the allegation. Legal experts say the case will eventually be sent to the European Court of Justice.An article on Tuesday about a Syrian refugee\u2019s efforts to block Facebook from allowing users to repost the image of him with Germany\u2019s chancellor misstated the date that a ruling in the case is expected from a German court. It is March 7, not March 3.Mark Scott contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Plan Is Most Unfriendly to Outsiders", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorSnap Inc. is aiming to adopt the most shareholder-unfriendly governance in an initial public offering, ever.It is different from its predecessors, Facebook and Google, which went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. In recent years, Facebook and Google have revised this structure to add a nonvoting third class of shares to preserve founder control, yet shareholders have had at least some vote even if they couldn\u2019t sway the results.Snap has followed the natural evolution of this disenfranchisement, simply eliminating shareholder rights from the get-go. And this is not just about replicating the venture capital model, where founders get control but investors get board seats and veto rights over significant transactions. Here, Snap is not even giving crumbs.For gurus of good corporate governance, this is bad enough, but once you dig into the details of how this nonvoting stock works, it gets much worse for shareholders.Snap has set up three share classes. Class A will be offered to the public. These shares have no voting rights and no hope of ever having voting rights.Class B shares have one vote each and are convertible into Class A stock. These are shares held by prior investors and employees.Then there are the Class C shares, with 10 votes each, which are convertible into Class B stock. These shares are held in equal number by the two Snap co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy. Specifically, each of them holds 107,943,924 Class C shares. These shares will give the two men complete voting control over Snap.The two founders have a proxy arrangement that transfers voting control to the other if one dies, but it doesn\u2019t cover whether they vote their shares together while alive, so presumably they could deadlock. Snap has solved this problem by granting a performance stock award to Mr. Spiegel that will be 3 percent of the company\u2019s post-I.P.O. value.This award will be paid out in equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in the third full quarter after the offering. After this, Mr. Spiegel will have total control over Snap and Mr. Murphy will simply be a close second.Snap, which looks a lot like Twitter did at its I.P.O. stage, could also experience bumps in the road as Twitter did. In its prospectus, Snap calls itself a camera company, but it really has just one product, Snapchat, which is beloved by the younger crowd for its disappearing photos and texts.Facebook, Google and Microsoft as well as Amazon have survived because of the ability to provide multiple successful offerings. Twitter has struggled with just one product \u2014 the platform on which people the world over, including the American president, send 140-character messages called tweets.If things are going well, no one is going to question Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy\u2019s control. But if things are bad, then shareholder complaints may be valid, a spur to action. Indeed, control makes sense only if shareholders and the two executives disagree about whether things are going well. But that assumes that shareholders will be irrational or wrong or not know as much as the two men at the helm. The last point may have some validity \u2014 but is it worth complete disenfranchisement, again given that Snap is a very early-stage company and Mr. Spiegel is so young?I suppose it all might be palatable for most diversified investors in exchange for the huge potential upside, except for the last two parts of this scheme. First, in October Snap issued a dividend of one Class A share for each Class C share the two men owned. The result was to allow Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy to sell half their shares without worry of losing control. The company could reload this at any point, issuing out another dividend of Class A shares if the two need more money.So, barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die. This raises some interesting possibilities.Hypothetical Scenario 1: Mr. Spiegel is hit by a bus and dies. Mr. Murphy would now have complete control of the company. Yet Mr. Spiegel is supposed to be the visionary executive who justified this voting structure. Or is Mr. Murphy, 28, equally visionary? (Or perhaps it is more likely they are just executing well on the \u201cdisappearing pictures\u201d concept just as Mark Cuban executed well on \u201cinternet radio\u201d before selling broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for billions of dollars.)Hypothetical Scenario 2: At age 30, Mr. Spiegel decides that life as a billionaire married to a supermodel (he\u2019s engaged to Miranda Kerr) is more fun spent on an island in the Pacific. He quits his job but still holds Class C shares and wields his power to elect directors and run the company part time.Hypothetical Scenario 3: Mr. Spiegel continues to hold the shares and keep his day job and at age 50 is head of a middling internet company with great potential, but he refuses to give up control, or starts behaving erratically.Potential investors, particularly the big money managers like the BlackRocks of the world, should likely be asking themselves: Is it all worth it, given the risks? I\u2019d note here that Google has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Mr. Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook nonvoting stock. Does Mr. Spiegel deserve better than that? And remember the other tech titans, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, all have one share, one vote.In its prospectus, Snap says its team is \u201ckind, smart and creative,\u201d which is kind of like Whitney Houston singing, \u201cI believe that children are the future.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot of other stuff about growth and big ideas. Snap may be right, and Evan Spiegel truly is the second coming, but this just does not justify the extreme governance given the risk. Instead, it just seems silly, but not in the fun Snapchat sort of way.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "36 Hours in Trinidad", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementCompared with its Caribbean neighbors, Trinidad gets few tourists except during its vibrant February carnival. This means that this tiny melting pot of a country \u2014 which shares nationhood with neighboring Tobago, and has a rich Indian-Creole-African-Chinese-British heritage \u2014 feels welcoming and authentic. Skyscrapers don\u2019t exist; instead there are captivating gingerbread-style houses with fanciful latticework. The local cuisine, which reflects its hodgepodge of cultures, is intriguing and delicious but not fancy: The best meals are eaten on the street and at cafeteria-style counters, not in high-end restaurants, which tend to be Europeanized. Spend Friday in the capital, Port of Spain, then use Saturday for excursions north to the beach and south to explore the calm waterways and wild birds of the Caroni Swamp.\nExplore street view, find things to do in Trinidad and sign in to your Google account to save your map.\nThe sprawling Queen\u2019s Park Savannah is the heart of the city, with amateur cricketers playing on the park\u2019s green lawns on weekends, and food stalls serving up some of the best casual dining in town after dusk. Head for the cluster of white tents, bright lights and music and stroll through, picking up corn soup flavored with vinegar and studded with chunks of carrots and corn on the cob, pholourie (dumplings, lightly fried and served with a sweet dipping sauce), chicken feet and cow heels pickled with slices of cucumber (called souse). Then finish with a bag of the sweet and savory \u201cchow\u201d: slices of peeled fruit, often underripe mango, salted and doused with a peppery garlic sauce. Dinner for two, around 100 Trinidad/Tobago dollars, or about $15. Vendors on the perimeter of the park will open a fresh coconut for 10 dollars. Drive north from the Green Market to Maracas Bay, along a narrow road of hairpin turns with gorgeous views from the cliffs\u2019 edge down to the water. Maracas Bay is the most popular beach within reach of the capital, and on Saturdays it can get crowded with people swimming in the clean, warm sea backed by lush green hills. One reason locals come here is for the \u201cshark n\u2019 bake\u201d that\u2019s sold at seaside food stands: a portion of shark (although skeptics say it\u2019s just \u201cfish\u201d) battered and fried, then tucked into the \u201cbake,\u201d a folded-over circle of fried bread (35 dollars). Try it at Vilma\u2019s, where the sauces are homemade, and add a cold Carib beer. Lined with Chinese restaurants, bars and stores that stay open late, Western Main Road in the St. James neighborhood is the place to come for an evening of partying (called \u201climing\u201d). Take a long, slow stroll starting at Cawnpore Street, and head west, stopping for the occasional cold, local Carib or Stag at a bar blasting soca music. Have a heavy street snack of Indian roti stuffed with chicken, beef or goat curry topped with potatoes, pumpkin and spiced mango (ask for \u201cslight\u201d pepper to avoid too much heat, around 25 dollars). Or pick up a \u201cpunch\u201d (the Trini word for juice); vendors sell shakes of soursop, passionfruit or sea moss, blended with ice and condensed milk. Sunday midday dinner is a Trini tradition. Head to Creole Kitchen, a cafeteria-style restaurant that looks out of place among the newer businesses that have sprung up around it. Locals pop in to pick up hearty takeaway containers of stewed chicken, macaroni pie topped with toasted cheese, and callaloo, a West African-influenced dish of taro leaves and coconut milk, but there are also tables for eating in.

In turning the Trayvon Martin tragedy into a virtual reality film, the director Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a combed through public court records and stitched together 911 calls to structure an auditory narrative of the rainy night that ended in the shooting death of the unarmed 17-year-old by George Zimmerman. To get the look of the apartment complex in Sanford, Fla., where the events took place, Ms. de la Pe\u00f1a, a former Newsweek correspondent who runs a virtual reality company in Santa Monica, found architectural drawings of the location online, designs that were then rendered as video game-like C.G.I. models.\u201cThis is immersive journalism,\u201d she said, intended to drive empathy. But it also raises issues about taste and truth. I caught up with Ms. de la Pe\u00f1a by phone. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:Q. How did this piece come together?Q. Why Trayvon Martin? Why not Freddie Gray or another tragedy?We\u2019re always trying to figure out what we can convey to the viewer and what\u2019s appropriate to show. For audiences not reading newspapers or watching broadcast TV, V.R. can reach them where they play. This is how you keep an informed global citizenry and keep democracy robust. What do we decide to shield them from?

More often than not, the administration\u2019s actions have been both highly unusual and highly consequential, The Upshot\u2019s 15 survey panelists said.We asked our panelists: Was the event normal, like the veto of a bill in a prior administration? Or was it highly unusual in contemporary American democracy, like ordering newspapers to suspend publication of the Pentagon Papers? Also, was it unimportant, with limited or no consequences for federal policy, like the menu for a state dinner? Or was it important, creating lasting and significant changes in policy, like the establishment of Social Security?On average, more than half the events were rated abnormal and important. The most extreme instances, they said, were the immigration ban; the use of falsehoods; and the president\u2019s business conflicts of interest. The Supreme Court nomination and immigration raids were on average considered normal but important. The experts thought just two of the events would have limited or no policy consequences: the firing of the acting attorney general and Kellyanne Conway\u2019s promotion of Ivanka Trump\u2019s products.Below are all 20 items, grouped by their quadrant on our reality-check matrix.We built the list of events based on news coverage of the first month of the Trump administration in The Times and elsewhere. We created our expert panel based on recommendations from four political scientists, as well as on research of people who had experience serving in past administrations, and we aimed for diversity of thought and background. We know our panel is small and does not reflect every point of view, but we feel it represents a useful guide to developments by people with deep experience studying or serving in government.For our survey, we asked the experts to rate each event on a scale of 1 to 5 according to how normal or abnormal they thought it was, and on a scale of 1 to 5 according to how unimportant or important they thought it was.

{"Headline": "Yahoo and Verizon Are Said to Be Near a Cheaper Deal", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Soon after Yahoo disclosed the first of two enormous data breaches that threatened to upend a $4.8 billion deal it had reached with Verizon Communications, the embattled company began to confront an unpleasant potential future.Yahoo could have battled Verizon to preserve the original price tag, a campaign that could have ended up in a Delaware courtroom \u2014 and led to months of bitter legal wrangling. Moreover, that strategy would have run the risk of allowing Verizon to walk away from the purchase altogether.Instead, Yahoo is close to renegotiating its original deal, choosing to take close to $300 million off the price to preserve the sale, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.Under the revised terms, the two companies are expected to share legal responsibility and costs for the data breaches, the person with knowledge of the matter said.The new deal is expected to be announced within days, this person added.Representatives for both companies declined to comment on the discussions.On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed additional information stemming from the breaches, notifying some users that it had found evidence of attempts to log in to their accounts without a password. Those attempts were made using data stolen in the 2014 hacking.Yahoo did not ask the users to change their passwords but urged them to use account key, an optional feature that uses a smartphone to validate all attempted logins on a Yahoo account.Verizon executives had earlier mused publicly about the severity of the Yahoo breaches and whether they had a material effect on the companies\u2019 deal, announced in July.Analysts, however, said Verizon, a telecommunications giant, had plenty of reasons to complete the transaction quickly, particularly to build up its digital media business.Verizon\u2019s core business, wireless phone service, is being hurt by stiffened competition from AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. Verizon was recently forced to bring back unlimited data plans to match its rivals\u2019 offerings.For Yahoo, salvaging the deal was even more vital.In putting its core internet business \u2014 including its still-popular email service, Yahoo Finance and sports arms \u2014 up for sale last year, the company sought to end years of questions about its declining business and whether it could effect a turnaround. A succession of chief executives, most recently Marissa Mayer, tried but failed, and investor discontent was high.After a highly public sales process, Verizon emerged the winner.Verizon sought Yahoo as part of its effort to build a digital media empire anchored by its earlier purchase of AOL, another aging internet property. AOL could not achieve the scale necessary to challenge Google and Facebook on its own, and Yahoo\u2019s business was meant to play a crucial role, bringing in more than a billion users.Verizon\u2019s archrival, AT&T, is also building a new business line in media. But in seeking to acquire Time Warner for $85 billion, it is aiming for a much greater scale more quickly.Still, the hacking disclosures appeared to rattle Verizon\u2019s plans.In September, Yahoo revealed that intruders it believed were backed by a foreign government had stolen the data, including encrypted passwords, of 500 million user accounts in 2014.Two months ago, Yahoo announced that an even larger breach, involving a billion accounts, had occurred in 2013. That breach compromised additional data, including security questions used to reset passwords. Yahoo forced all of the affected users to change their passwords.In both cases, there is evidence that Yahoo knew about the intrusions for some time before they were publicly disclosed.Yahoo has shared few additional details in recent months, citing continuing investigations by outside security firms, its board of directors and law enforcement authorities.Its reticence drew the ire last week of the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who sent a letter to Ms. Mayer demanding more information about the breaches and what Yahoo had done to protect its users since then.Yahoo said last month that it was confident its deal with Verizon would close by the end of June.The long delay has taken a toll on Yahoo\u2019s business. The company has continued to lose market share in digital advertising as Facebook and Google expand their dominance and shiny newcomers like Snapchat attract the attention of marketers.While waiting for the deal, Yahoo\u2019s management has focused on cutting costs, eliminating more than 2,100 jobs in the last year.Yahoo stockholders are eager to see the deal close so that Yahoo can focus on finding ways to extract the value of its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, and its 36 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group.Those investments, which are supposed to remain in a stub company called Altaba, are worth about $48 billion combined.Advertisement"}

Though she did not refer to President Trump directly, she read from a golden note card, and spoke of beauty and racial identity as well as how important it was that her children see representations of themselves in popular culture, including \u201cthe news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys.\u201d\u201cThis is something I want for every child of every race,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cAnd I feel it\u2019s vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes.\u201d(The choice of word was likely a reference to an incident in Congress last week, when Senator Elizabeth Warren was cut short on the Senate floor as she gave a speech against Jeff Sessions\u2019s confirmation as attorney general. \u201cShe was warned.

{"Headline": "How to Close a Gender Gap: Let Employees Control Their Schedules", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen\u2019s WorkThe main reason for the gender gaps at work \u2014 why women are paid less, why they\u2019re less likely to reach the top levels of companies, and why they\u2019re more likely to stop working after having children \u2014 is employers\u2019 expectation that people spend long hours at their desks, research has shown.It\u2019s especially difficult for women because they have disproportionate responsibility for caregiving.A new job search company, Werk, is trying to address the problem by negotiating for flexibility with employers before posting jobs, so employees don\u2019t have to.Another option gives workers the freedom to adjust their schedules, no questions asked, because of unpredictable obligations, like a sleepless night with a toddler or a trip to the emergency room with an older parent.\u201cNobody wants to be the female in the department who says, \u2018My kid threw up on me this morning; I can\u2019t come in,\u2019 \u201d said Annie Dean, who worked as a lawyer before starting Werk with Anna Auerbach, a former consultant. \u201cEighty percent of companies say they offer flexibility, but it\u2019s a black market topic. You raise it and you\u2019re not taken seriously.\u201dFor now, Werk is a limited experiment. Most of the employers are small companies, and it is aimed at an elite group of women \u2014 highly educated and on a leadership track. But it could provide lessons for how to improve work and make it more equal for a broader group.Women who have less education or are paid hourly wages have significantly less flexibility than professional women to begin with. It makes working and caregiving that much harder.Gerard Masci, founder and chief executive of Lowercase, a start-up eyeglass maker in Brooklyn, just hired a vice president for communications on Werk. She works part-time and remotely, except for monthly in-person meetings. \u201cI don\u2019t care if this week you work less if in a month you work more, and whether they work in the space or not is irrelevant,\u201d Mr. Masci said. \u201cAll I care about is the productivity in the end.\u201d\u201cThe happier she is in her flexibility,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more engaged she\u2019s going to be in her work.\u201dErin Fahs turned to Werk after her husband was transferred to Fort Myers, Fla., and she needed to find a new job. She wanted to work part time and from home because she was pregnant and the primary caregiver for their 2-year-old daughter. She found three jobs on Werk that would let her do that, and took one as the business manager for the Collective Good, which does consulting for nonprofits.\u201cGetting to have those direct conversations with the C.E.O. about what matters made it so much different from when I was applying for jobs earlier in my career,\u201d Ms. Fahs, 33, said.She has a baby sitter 10 hours a week and works the other 10 hours when her daughter is sleeping. She has a few set meetings, which she attends via Google Hangouts \u2014 and gives her daughter an iPad for a diversion if there is a work emergency. She plans to expand to full-time work after maternity leave.\u201cThere are a vast number of jobs that could be handled in an own-your-schedule way, but it\u2019s just easier to measure performance by presence,\u201d said Anne-Marie Slaughter, the chief executive of the think tank New America, who has written about gender and work and advises Werk. \u201cSo it is a real adjustment for managers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Girl Who Hunts With Hawks", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRunning With ShermanAnna Kendrick isn\u2019t just beautiful; if you could spend time with her in the woods, you\u2019d realize she\u2019s also lethal, a born hunter with a killer\u2019s reflexes who thrives on things you\u2019d never put in your mouth.Jenna Woginrich is one of the few who have seen Anna in action, and it didn\u2019t come easily. At first, Jenna and Anna just hung out together, watching movies at night in front of a crackling wood stove. It took weeks before they trusted each other enough for Anna to cut loose and show her wild side. Jenna was thrilled \u2014 but it didn\u2019t last long.\u201cBy that summer, she was gone,\u201d Jenna says, with surprisingly little regret in her voice. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201dIt\u2019s a miserable day as we walk the woods near her upstate New York farm, freezing rain and icy winds lashing us from all sides, but Jenna has reason to be upbeat: on her arm is the new love in her life, a gorgeous red-tailed hawk she calls Aya Cash after the actress who starred in \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t they just fly away?\u201d I ask.\u201cSometimes they do,\u201d Jenna says. \u201cWe\u2019re about to find out.\u201dToday is Aya\u2019s big test. Jenna is about to set her free on her first solo flight, giving Aya a choice between staying with Jenna or rocketing back into the forest. That\u2019s the magic I\u2019m hoping to understand: what makes a bird of prey choose human friendship over freedom?And hunts with hawks.Jenna got her first taste of falconry at a nearby resort where she worked as an archery instructor. She loved everything about it: the ancient lore, the long hikes in the woods, but especially, the intense focus and kinship necessary to bond with a creature whose every native instinct is to get as far from you as possible. To get started, you have to find two things: 1) a seasoned falconer who agrees to monitor your hawk\u2019s health, and 2) a hawk.Jenna caught Aya by slowly driving the roads around her farm for three weeks until she spotted that proud, unmistakable silhouette perched on a telephone wire. She tossed out a trap \u2014 basically, a ball of chicken wire with bait inside \u2014 and when Aya pounced, so did Jenna. Hawks are submissive when cornered, so Jenna was able to gather Aya up in a T-shirt, free her talons from the wire mesh, and take her home.\u201cI\u2019m not teaching her to be my pet,\u201d Jenna explains. \u201cI\u2019m giving her a chance to stay alive and become a strong hunter.\u201d Only one in every 10 hawks survives until breeding age in the wild, so oddly, the luckiest moment of Aya\u2019s life might have been the day she was scooped into Jenna\u2019s hands. Jenna spends hours with Aya every day, feeding her morsels of rabbit and mouse \u2014 the same food she\u2019d eat on her own \u2014 and testing her with short, tethered flights to sharpen her hunting eye.\u201cAya and I are all about work,\u201d Jenna says. They\u2019re picking up a partnership that\u2019s been around since before the Pharaohs. Ancient Egyptians were often buried with their favorite kestrel, and even cave art depicts early hunters with hawks and dogs. Very early in our in history, humans and raptors must have worked out a deal that satisfied both.\u201cIt\u2019s pure calculation on her part,\u201d Jenna says, nodding toward Aya on her arm. \u201cI\u2019m about to set her loose, and if it isn\u2019t a good deal for her, she\u2019ll be gone.\u201dJenna spotted what she was looking for: a branch about head-high in a tree with good flight clearance. It\u2019s a risky day for flying. Aya may not spot Jenna in the gray rain or hear her voice over the wind. Still, Jenna slips off Aya\u2019s hood and eases her onto the branch. Jenna turns her back on Aya. As we walk away, wondering what Aya will do, Jenna lets me in on her best advice.Every fall, she says, she catches a new hawk. They hunt together all winter and come spring, when the bird is ready to mate, Jenna leaves it in a field with a fresh-killed rabbit to start its own life.\u201cYou spend time crafting something beautiful, and then you let it go,\u201d is how Jenna puts it. \u201cThe wild can be human work,\u201d notes Helen Macdonald in her 2014 memoir \u201cH Is for Hawk,\u201d pointing out that without the gentle intervention of falconers who protect their birds until maturity, entire species would now be extinct. Sherman comes from a long line of desert foragers who evolved to trot marathon distances. Aya is a fledgling whose survival is threatened by power lines, farmers and bulldozed woodlands. If we can help them develop their native talents, we\u2019ll have something better than a pet: a partner.\u201cOr just a long walk alone in the rain,\u201d Jenna points out. There\u2019s been no sign of Aya since we left her and from this distance, her natural camouflage is already making her hard to spot. A few more steps and she\u2019ll be invisible. A faint jingle of bells indicates she\u2019s still nearby.\u201cO.K., here we go,\u201d Jenna says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen? She flies off to be a hawk.\u201d She walks a few more steps, then pulls some food from her pouch, raises her arm, and whistles.The branch rustles, and suddenly Aya plunges from the tree, soaring toward Jenna like she can\u2019t wait to be home.Advertisement"}

In addition to the Manhattan studio, she has three Power Stretch outposts in New Jersey and one in Florida.\u201cThere are all these peak fitness places that have popped up,\u201d said Ms. DuBose, who is 32 (but 25 in stretch years), referring to SoulCycle, Barry\u2019s Bootcamp and CrossFit. \u201cPeople go five times a week and their muscles are very overworked and contracted.\u201dShe is far from the only entrepreneur who is confident that stretching is the new big thing in fitness.\u201cStretching is especially important in our modern world because we don\u2019t have as many slow movements integrated into most of our lives anymore,\u201d said Diane Waye, the owner of Stretching by the Bay, a studio in San Francisco. \u201cWe need to keep our range of motion open to help prevent joint disease, pain and posture issues and to improve athletic performance.\u201dHowever worthy their cause, these stretching emporiums have an uphill climb.

Real estate prices are high, customer loyalty uncertain.\u201cJust like any small business, there are definite challenges to operating a health club,\u201d said Meredith Poppler, the vice president for communications at the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, a trade group. \u201cHigh competition, especially in urban areas, is often fierce, and member retention rates keep many club operators up all night.\u201dMs. DuBose and her peers face a particular challenge: Their programs are meant simply to supplement a workout. Also, stretching may hurt so good, but it still hurts (a lot, sometimes).\u201cYou have to let your body get used to it,\u201d Rick Charron, the manager of StretchOut Studios, said. \u201cThis is something that may start off painful, but you give it a couple of times and the pain will decrease as your range of motion increases.\u201dPower Stretch Studios\u2019 aim is not just to increase flexibility but also to reduce tension. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that makes me different,\u201d said Ms. DuBose, who requires employees and customers to sign nondisclosure agreements about the moves involved in what she calls the Kika Method. (She is in the process of changing the company\u2019s name to Kika Stretch Studios.)To relax those taut muscles, so-called stretch coaches work one on one with clients in customized sessions that are part massage, part chiropractic, part dancer\u2019s warm-up. \u201cIt\u2019s all about creating space within the body,\u201d Ms. DuBose said.Her target audience: the sedentary souls perennially slouched over their computers, and fitness enthusiasts who view pre- and post-workout stretching as time better spent in transit or in the shower.\u201cWhether you work out or don\u2019t work out, your muscles contract throughout the day,\u201d Ms. DuBose said. \u201cThat keeps happening over time and puts pressure on your nerves and bones. People have nagging pain and they can\u2019t figure out how to get rid of it, so they just live with it.\u201cIt\u2019s even worse for people who do work out,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause when they stretch all that effort simply creates more contracting and more tension. People who are in pain have tried everything and they\u2019re still in pain. Then they come to us and we\u2019re like, \u2018That isn\u2019t pain; that\u2019s tension.\u2019\u201dMs. DuBose, who majored in dance at Montclair State University in New Jersey, was a showgirl in \u201cUniverSoul Circus\u201d at the Apollo Theater and made two appearances on \u201c30 Rock\u201d before deciding she had had enough of life as a starving artist.A single mother, she wanted both a reliable source of income and a flexible schedule. Braiding the skills she acquired during a stint as a personal trainer with the moves she learned as a dancer, Ms. DuBose began rolling on the floor until she felt certain muscles, then devised corresponding stretches, ultimately 35 in all. Thus, the Kika method was born.It includes the High Five Stretch, which is meant to disperse tension held between the fingers and to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome; the Neck Peddle, which is intended to lessen shoulder pain; and the Quad and Hip Flexor, a stretch designed to relieve tension and lengthen the thigh muscle.To build the business, she stood in front of her original studio in Montclair handing out fliers (while an actor dressed as Gumby demonstrated stretches) and left stacks of them at gyms and the local Y.M.C.A. She invited chiropractors to check out her studio and hired a search-optimization firm to improve her ranking on Google. \u201cWhen I first started, I was met with skepticism all the time,\u201d Ms. DuBose said.The Montclair studio, which temporarily relocated to a church down the street because of a fire over Labor Day weekend, now has 300 regulars per month, Ms. DuBose said, many of whom come once a week. The Westfield studio, which opened in November 2015, has 171 clients, while the New York branch, which opened in August, has 350.Customers can expect to expend 125 calories for a 45-minute session, which costs $80, or $100 in New York. An hour session is $90, or $120 in Manhattan.Group classes were tried, then abandoned \u201cbecause they don\u2019t work,\u201d Ms. DuBose said. She feels similarly about stretching machines, she said, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t know how far to stretch your body or when to stop.\u201d\u201cFor the last five to seven years, the trend has been high-intensity like CrossFit,\u201d Pete McCall, a spokesman for the American Council on Exercise, said. \u201cBut now we\u2019re seeing a shift in the opposite direction, where the thinking is, \u2018Let\u2019s work on passive mobility and range-of-motion and the recovery aspect of exercise.\u2019 We\u2019re starting to see more studios focus on passive stretching, or highlight it. They\u2019re doing one-on-one sessions and group classes where the instructor coaches you how to position various limbs.\u201dWhether specialty stretch studios can compete with the stretching options offered at fitness clubs and elsewhere is another question. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing unique about passive stretching,\u201d said Arlen Zwickler, the general manager of the Athletic and Swim Club at Equitable Center in Manhattan. \u201cTrainers who are well schooled can do it. A massage therapist can do it.\u201dOn a recent Thursday evening at the Power Stretch Studio in Manhattan, Ms. DuBose headed to one of the three dark, small stretching rooms to work on Matthew Frankel.\u201cMy wife got me a five-pack of sessions for my birthday, and I\u2019ve been addicted ever since,\u201d said Mr. Frankel, 45, a communications strategist who is usually stretched twice a week in Montclair. When he came in for his initial assessment, he was somewhere between 56 and 65 in stretch years, he said; now he is a brag-worthy 25.Stretch 12 in the Kika manual had Ms. DuBose cupping her hand over a tight muscle on Mr. Frankel\u2019s shoulder blade. \u201cI\u2019m compressing it and helping it stretch and release,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal is to open the chest.\u201dThen she positioned him for a hamstring stretch. \u201cNow, this is a stretch where I lose friends,\u201d Ms. DuBose said. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, exerting pressure on his thigh. \u201cDo you still like me?\u201dHe does. \u201cThis is a very relaxing way to spend 60 minutes,\u201d Mr. Frankel said. \u201cI could go to a national gym, but this is a small business providing craftsmanship.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oscar-Nominated Movies, Sometimes Streaming Near You", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingOne common complaint about the Oscars addresses the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 perceived tendency to honor movies that ostensibly no one has seen. In some cases, the complainants are talking about prestige films that didn\u2019t do a lot at the box office. A couple of months ago, I was listening to a podcast featuring two of the West Coast\u2019s more colorful Oscar commentators, and one of them excitedly put \u201cLa La Land\u201d in the category of films no one has seen. At the time, the movie, a critical favorite among festivalgoers, had not yet been released. Oscar commentators can be very silly people.\u201cLa La Land\u201d has since gone into something like wide release \u2014 it\u2019s in about 2,000 theaters, about half the number that super-wide releases will be in at the height of their glory \u2014 and is doing well enough that you can say some people have seen it, and now that it has garnered 14 Oscar nominations, more people will.This year, streaming video services are beginning to change how Oscar-nominated movies are seen, for one very simple reason: These services are financing, producing and distributing movies they hope will win Oscars. \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d distributed by Amazon Studios, landed six nominations, including for best picture. While it\u2019s still playing in theaters (a little over 500, as of this writing), it will hit video on demand and be available for download for a fee from Amazon and other services, including FandangoNow, in early February. It will start streaming on Amazon in May, when it will be free for Prime members.Right now, one of the five nominees for best documentary, Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201c13th,\u201d is on Netflix, the company that produced the movie. One of this year\u2019s other best documentary nominees, \u201cO.J.: Made in America,\u201d in fact, aired as a television mini-series after a brief theatrical qualifying run, and has been available on demand since it first ran on ESPN.Of the other nominees for best picture besides \u201cManchester,\u201d only the crime thriller \u201cHell or High Water\u201d (which also drew a best supporting actor nod for Jeff Bridges and an original screenplay one for Taylor Sheridan) can be seen on YouTube, Amazon Video, iTunes, Vudu and Google Play at prices from $2.99 to $14.99 depending on the rent-buy option you choose. Viggo Mortensen\u2019s nominated leading-man turn in the hippie-family tear-jerker \u201cCaptain Fantastic\u201d can also be viewed via those services. So, too, can one of the more distinctive of the best animated feature nominees, \u201cKubo and the Two Strings.\u201dMeryl Streep in the title role of the tragicomic biopic \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d can be seen via all the same services save Amazon. Another best actress nominee, Ruth Negga, was recognized for her work in the fact-based civil rights drama \u201cLoving\u201d; that picture can be seen for a fee on Vudu, Amazon and iTunes. Michael Shannon was considered a surprise in the best supporting actor category for his work in \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d; the movie is not coming to streaming as such, but it will debut on demand on Feb. 21, the same day the Blu-ray and DVD package, which includes access to a digital download, comes out.I was actually a little surprised, looking at the home pages of several streaming services on Tuesday, when the nominations were announced, to not see much in the way of Oscar promotion. However many viewers tune in on the big night or not, the Oscars are an arguably potent form of clickbait, and even if major nominated films haven\u2019t made it to streaming yet, the services themselves teem with work by the nominees.The Greek cinematic provocateur Yorgos Lanthimos earned a screenplay nomination for \u201cThe Lobster\u201d (available on Amazon Video); his discomfiting earlier features \u201cDogtooth\u201d and \u201cAlps\u201d are on Fandor, a conscientious cinephile site that gives Amazon Prime users a free trial. \u201cMedicine for Melancholy,\u201d the first feature by Barry Jenkins, whose haunting \u201cMoonlight\u201d garnered eight nominations, including best picture and director, is on iTunes and Amazon. Given that \u201cMoonlight\u201d is just Mr. Jenkins\u2019s second feature, there\u2019s not much of a remove between the films.Similarly, one can view all of the previous features of Damien Chazelle, the director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d via Amazon Prime. Fandor has his \u201cGuy and Madeline on a Park Bench\u201d (2009), while Prime carries \u201cWhiplash\u201d (2014). For good measure, on Amazon there\u2019s also another music-themed picture for which Chazelle wrote the screenplay, the 2013 novelty thriller \u201cGrand Piano.\u201d (Amazon has \u201cThe Last Exorcism 2,\u201d which was partly written by Mr. Chazelle; he is also one of five credited screenwriters on the more respectable horror movie \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d for rent or purchase on major sites.)Finally, a warning: Be on the lookout for purveyors of pirated content who piggyback on legitimate services like Vimeo. For example, in my searches I came across results saying the animated film \u201cTrolls\u201d (yes, it has an Oscar nominee for best song: Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling!\u201d) and \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d were streaming in full on the aforementioned site. But they are not. (And \u201cAnimals\u201d has since been removed.) Once you hit play and the studio logo comes up, you are asked to \u201cregister\u201d and log in with a separate \u201cservice.\u201d I declined to do this, and I would advise you to do the same.An earlier version of this article misstated the format in which \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d will be released in February. It will be available for download for a fee. It will not begin streaming until May on Amazon. The article also misstated the date that \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d will debut on demand. It is Feb. 21, not earlier in the month.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford to Invest $1 Billion in Artificial Intelligence Start-Up", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of the oldest automakers in the United States is making a billion-dollar bet that one day, owning a car may not be a necessity of American life.Ford Motor announced on Friday its plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December that is focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology.The move is Ford\u2019s biggest effort to move into self-driving car research. Argo AI will develop the technology exclusively for Ford at first, and then plans to license its technology to others.Argo AI will operate as a subsidiary of Ford; the automaker will be the majority shareholder. But Argo AI will also use shares of its stock to lure robotics and engineering professionals from other companies, a challenge in a field where companies like General Motors, Chrysler, Uber and Google are all racing to bring autonomous vehicles to the mainstream.\u201cIf we can combine the best of a start-up and marry that with proper equity compensation, then that\u2019s the best of both worlds,\u201d Mark Fields, president and chief executive of Ford, said at an event with reporters in San Francisco on Friday.Ford sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars. Manufacturing vehicles requires billions of dollars in investments in plants and engineering \u2014 costs that are often difficult to recoup. Company executives have said mobility services could generate returns of around 20 percent, compared with the 8 percent it earns on making vehicles today.As part of that strategy, Ford has been racing to develop self-driving cars, put down roots in Silicon Valley and acquire fledgling players in ride-hailing services, autonomous-driving technologies and related areas.\u201cThere is not a strong enough pipeline of talent coming out of the universities today,\u201d Bryan Salesky, chief executive and co-founder of Argo AI, said on Friday. Mr. Salesky said Argo AI was looking to hire 200 employees across its three offices by the end of the year.In the last several months, Ford acquired Chariot, a start-up that ferries commuters around the San Francisco area, and invested in Civil Maps, which is developing 3-D mapping technology that can be used by self-driving cars. In August, Ford also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli company developing machine learning and computer-vision technology.A year ago, Ford opened a research center in Palo Alto, Calif., a move Mr. Fields acknowledged was aimed at making Ford \u201cpart of the ecosystem of Silicon Valley.\u201dFord is also remaking its headquarters and main development center in Dearborn, Mich., just outside Detroit, into two sprawling, high-tech campuses of energy-efficient buildings \u2014 similar to those that dot Silicon Valley. The automaker envisions the new campuses, which will take 10 years to complete, as places that will showcase autonomous shuttles as well as electric bikes and other green modes of transportation.Other automakers are moving in the same direction. General Motors has invested $500 million in Lyft, a ride-hailing service and main rival of Uber. G.M. also acquired Cruise Automation, a maker of sensors and other gear that can enable conventional automobiles to drive themselves on highways.Like Ford, G.M. also has a Silicon Valley tech center, and it is spending $1 billion to renovate its main big development campus in Warren, Mich.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Neal E.

{"Headline": "Uber C.E.O. to Leave Trump Advisory Council After Criticism", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Travis Kalanick needed everyone to take a deep breath.The chief executive of Uber was holding a regularly scheduled all-hands meeting on Tuesday at the ride-hailing company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters when he faced an onslaught of questions from upset employees.\u201cWhat would it take for you to quit the economic council?\u201d at least two employees asked at the Tuesday meeting.On Thursday, Mr. Kalanick gave his answer, stepping down from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory council. \u201cThere are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,\u201d Mr. Kalanick wrote in an email to employees obtained by The New York Times.Outside of the internal pressure, Uber faced other fallout from Mr. Kalanick\u2019s stance. More than 200,000 customers had deleted their accounts.In addition, Uber rivals had seized the moment to attack the company and bolster their own businesses. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance sent emails to the news media calling attention to Uber\u2019s ties to Mr. Trump, and organized a protest at Uber\u2019s New York office for Thursday. Lyft, another ride-hailing service, pledged to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union and has seen its app shoot toward the top of the download charts.Uber drivers, many of them immigrants who work for the ride-hailing company on a freelance basis, were also upset.Email from Travis Kalanick, chief of Uber, announcing that he was stepping down from President Trump\u2019s economic advisory council.Uber has set aside $3 million for a legal-defense fund to support drivers, offering help with translation services and round-the-clock telephone access to legal aid.For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was especially fraught. Other corporate chiefs, including Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX, and Mary Barra of General Motors, are also on the president\u2019s economic advisory team. Mr. Musk said on Twitter this week that the group of economic advisers planned to come to some sort of \u201cconsensus\u201d on immigration, and to influence Mr. Trump by engaging directly with him rather than cutting off ties completely.Internally, Uber staff members also began piling on the pressure. According to nearly a dozen current and former Uber engineers and product managers who attended or were briefed on the Tuesday all-hands meeting, employees said they were concerned that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s willingness to work with Mr. Trump after the immigration order would color Uber as a soulless company that cared only about its bottom line.Some told Mr. Kalanick that they had suffered a personal cost \u2014 a stigma, they said \u2014 of working at Uber. One staff member asked him to present the benefits of working at Uber that could outweigh that personal cost.Mr. Kalanick replied that he believed that change could be best effected through engagement, and through the work they did every single day.Many employees were not satisfied with his answer. On Wednesday, Uber staff members followed up by circulating a 25-page Google document titled \u201cLetters to Travis\u201d to tell the chief executive how and why his willingness to engage with the administration had affected them.By Thursday morning, Mr. Kalanick had reversed his position on engaging with Mr. Trump. His participation in the economic advisory council had created what he called a \u201cperception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are.\u201dIn his email to employees, he said his participation was being interpreted as a sign that he had endorsed the president and the administration\u2019s agenda. In fact, Mr. Kalanick said, the immigration order was hurting many people across America.\u201cImmigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country\u2019s success and quite honestly to Uber\u2019s,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Kalanick said he had spoken briefly with Mr. Trump to let him know he was withdrawing from the advisory council.\u201cPlease know, your questions and stories on Tuesday, along with what I heard from drivers, have kept me resilient and reminded me of one of our most essential cultural values, Be Yourself,\u201d Mr. Kalanick wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Wouldn\u2019t Work Without Immigrants", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The workers of Silicon Valley make unlikely revolutionaries. As a group, they are relatively wealthy, well educated and well connected.While most here supported Hillary Clinton, tech workers are not the most obvious targets of President Trump\u2019s policy ideas. Many who populate the world\u2019s richest tech companies will be just fine if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. Most will not be personally inconvenienced by the proposed Mexican border wall.Under Mr. Trump, tech workers could enjoy a windfall. They may get tax credits for child care costs, their companies may be allowed to repatriate foreign profits, and their coming income tax cuts might fund a luxury vacation or two.\u201cSilicon Valley is unlikely, as a phenomenon \u2014 it is not the default state of the world,\u201d said John Collison, an immigrant from Ireland who is a co-founder of Stripe, a six-year-old payments start-up based in San Francisco.One important reason Silicon Valley can exist at all, he said, is that it is welcoming to people from far outside its borders. \u201cI go all across the world, and every other place is asking, \u2018How do we replicate Silicon Valley where we are \u2014 in London, in Paris, in Singapore, in Australia?\u2019\u201dThe reason those places have so far failed to create their own indomitable tech hubs is that everyone there wants to come here.\u201cThe U.S. is sucking up all the talent from all across the world,\u201d Mr. Collison said. \u201cLook at all the leading technology companies globally, and look at how overrepresented the United States is. That\u2019s not a normal state of affairs. That\u2019s because we have managed to create this engine where the best and the brightest from around the world are coming to Silicon Valley.\u201dBut, Mr. Collison added, \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of fragile.\u201d Under Mr. Trump, the immigrant-friendly dynamic could change \u2014 and it could bring about the ruin of American tech.And yet even a casual trip through most histories of the technology industry reveals an outsize role played by immigrants.Collectively, these companies, which include householdish names like Uber, Tesla and Palantir, had created thousands of jobs and added billions of dollars to the American economy. Their founders came from all over the world \u2014 India, Britain, Canada, Israel and China, among lots and lots of other points around the globe.That should come as no surprise if you are familiar with the origins of the most iconic companies of the last few decades. One of Google\u2019s founders is an immigrant from Russia, and its current chief executive is an immigrant from India. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive is also from India. EBay and Yahoo were started by immigrants. Facebook\u2019s largest subsidiaries, Instagram and WhatsApp, were both co-founded by immigrants. Apple was started by a child of immigrants.But if that criticism rings true in some parts of the tech industry, it misses the picture among Silicon Valley\u2019s top companies. One common misperception of Silicon Valley is that it operates like a factory; in that view, tech companies can hire just about anyone from anywhere in the world to fill a particular role.But today\u2019s most ambitious tech companies are not like factories. They\u2019re more like athletic teams. They\u2019re looking for the LeBrons and Bradys \u2014 the best people in the world to come up with some brand-new, never-before-seen widget, to completely reimagine what widgets should do in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s not about adding tens or hundreds of thousands of people into manufacturing plants,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the co-founder and chief executive of the cloud-storage company Box. \u201cIt\u2019s about the couple ideas that are going to be invented that are going to change everything.\u201dIf you look at some of the most consequential ideas in tech, you find an unusual number that were developed by immigrants. For instance, Google\u2019s entire advertising business \u2014 that is, the basis for the vast majority of its revenues and profits, the engine that allows it to hire thousands of people in the United States \u2014 was created by three immigrants: Salar Kamangar and Omid Kordestani, who came to the United States from Iran, and Eric Veach, from Canada.But it\u2019s not just a numbers thing. Another reason immigrants do so well in tech is that people from outside bring new perspectives that lead to new ideas.Mike Krieger, an immigrant from Brazil who is a co-founder of Instagram, the photo-based social network app, said one reason it found instant, international success was that he purposely eliminated most text from the app. He knew from growing up in Brazil that English would hinder adoption in most parts of the world.\u201cEvery step of the way while we were creating it,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were thinking, can you create something with international appeal?\u201dMr. Collison, of Stripe, said he could not imagine creating a company without immigrants. \u201cIn the early stages of a start-up you usually have a very specific set of things you need to do, and there\u2019s a very short list of people who are able to do them,\u201d he said.In its early years, Stripe needed engineers and executives to build its system for moving money around the world; it needed to create a novel machine-learning system to detect fraud; and it had to convince regulators and other businesses that it was safe and legal to process payments through Stripe. The people it found for all these roles happened to be immigrants.\u201cThe fact that we can do that in Silicon Valley \u2014 the fact that the talent is here or that we can bring the talent here, that\u2019s what makes the whole thing work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Future of Not Working", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "The Future of WorkAs automation reduces the need for human labor, some Silicon Valley executives think a universal income will be the answer \u2014 and the beta test is happening in Kenya.Supported byIn October, I visited Kennedy Aswan Abagi, the village chief, at his small red-earth home, decorated with posters celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden and the lives of African heroes, including JaKogelo, or \u201cthe man from Kogelo,\u201d as locals refer to former President Barack Obama. Kogelo, where Obama\u2019s father was born, is just 20 miles from the village, which lies close to the banks of Lake Victoria. Abagi told me about the day his town\u2019s fate changed. It happened during the summer, when field officers from an American nonprofit called GiveDirectly paid a visit, making an unbelievable promise: They wanted to give everyone money, no strings attached. \u201cI asked, \u2018Why this village?\u2019\u2009\u201d Abagi recalled, but he never got a clear answer, or one that made much sense to him.The villagers had seen Western aid groups come through before, sure, but nearly all of them brought stuff, not money. And because many of these organizations were religious, their gifts came with moral impositions; I was told that one declined to help a young mother whose child was born out of wedlock, for example. With little sense of who would get what and how and from whom and why, rumors blossomed. One villager heard that GiveDirectly would kidnap children. Some thought that the organization was aligned with the Illuminati, or that it would blight the village with giant snakes, or that it performed blood magic. Others heard that the money was coming from Obama himself.But the confusion faded that unseasonably cool morning in October, when a GiveDirectly team returned to explain themselves during a town meeting. Nearly all of the village\u2019s 220 people crowded into a blue-and-white tent placed near the school building, watching nervously as 13 strangers, a few of them white, sat on plastic chairs opposite them. Lydia Tala, a Kenyan GiveDirectly staff member, got up to address the group in Dholuo. She spoke at a deliberate pace, awaiting a hum and a nod from the crowd before she moved on: These visitors are from GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a nongovernmental organization that is not affiliated with any political party. GiveDirectly is based in the United States. GiveDirectly works with mobile phones. Each person must have his or her own mobile phone, and they must keep their PIN secret. Nobody must involve themselves in criminal activity or terrorism. This went on for nearly two hours. The children were growing restless.Finally, Tala passed the microphone to her colleague, Brian Ouma. \u201cPeople of the village,\u201d he said, \u201care you happy?\u201d\u201cWe are!\u201d they cried in unison.Then he laid out the particulars. \u201cEvery registered person will receive 2,280 shillings\u201d \u2014 about $22 \u2014 \u201ceach and every month. You hear me?\u201d The audience gasped and burst into wild applause. \u201cEvery person we register here will receive the money, I said \u2014 2,280 shillings! Every month. This money, you will get for the next 12 years. How many years?\u201d\u201cTwelve years!\u201dJust like that, with peals of ululation and children breaking into dance in front of the strangers, the whole village was lifted out of extreme poverty. (I have agreed to withhold its name out of concern for the villagers\u2019 safety.) The nonprofit is in the process of registering roughly 40 more villages with a total of 6,000 adult residents, giving those people a guaranteed, 12-year-long, poverty-ending income. An additional 80 villages, with 11,500 residents all together, will receive a two-year basic income. With this initiative, GiveDirectly \u2014 with an office in New York and funded in no small part by Silicon Valley \u2014 is starting the world\u2019s first true test of a universal basic income. The idea is perhaps most in vogue in chilly, left-leaning places, among them Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. But many economists think it might have the most promise in places with poorer populations, like India and sub-Saharan Africa.GiveDirectly wants to show the world that a basic income is a cheap, scalable way to aid the poorest people on the planet. \u201cWe have the resources to eliminate extreme poverty this year,\u201d Michael Faye, a founder of GiveDirectly, told me. But these resources are often misallocated or wasted. His nonprofit wants to upend incumbent charities, offering major donors a platform to push money to the world\u2019s neediest immediately and practically without cost.What happens in this village has the potential to transform foreign-aid institutions, but its effects might also be felt closer to home. A growing crowd, including many of GiveDirectly\u2019s backers in Silicon Valley, are looking at this pilot project not just as a means of charity but also as the groundwork for an argument that a universal basic income might be right for you, me and everyone else around the world too.Silicon Valley has recently become obsessed with basic income for reasons simultaneously generous and self-interested, as a palliative for the societal turbulence its inventions might unleash. Many technologists believe we are living at the precipice of an artificial-intelligence revolution that could vault humanity into a postwork future. In the past few years, artificially intelligent systems have become proficient at a startling number of tasks, from reading cancer scans to piloting a car to summarizing a sports game to translating prose. Any job that can be broken down into discrete, repeatable tasks \u2014 financial analytics, marketing, legal work \u2014 could be automated out of existence.In this vision of the future, our economy could turn into a funhouse-mirror version of itself: extreme income and wealth inequality, rising poverty, mass unemployment, a shrinking prime-age labor force. It would be more George Saunders than George Jetson. But what does this all have to do with a small village in Kenya?A universal basic income has thus far lacked what tech folks might call a proof of concept. There have been a handful of experiments, including ones in Canada, India and Namibia. Finland is sending money to unemployed people, and the Dutch city Utrecht is doing a trial run, too. But no experiment has been truly complete, studying what happens when you give a whole community money for an extended period of time \u2014 when nobody has to worry where his or her next meal is coming from or fear the loss of a job or the birth of a child.And so, the tech industry is getting behind GiveDirectly and other organizations testing the idea out. Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder and briefly the owner of The New Republic, has started a $10 million, two-year initiative to explore the viability of a basic income. (He has also been a major donor to GiveDirectly.) The research wing of Sam Altman\u2019s start-up incubator, Y Combinator, is planning to pass out money to 1,000 families in California and another yet-to-be-determined state. Then there is GiveDirectly itself, which has attracted $24 million in donations for its basic-income effort, including money from founders of Facebook, Instagram, eBay and a number of other Silicon Valley companies. Many donors I spoke with cited their interest in the project as purely philanthropic. But others saw it as a chance to learn more about a universal basic income, a way to prove that it could work and a chance to show people the human face of a hypothetical policy fix.In December, Altman, the 31-year-old president of Y Combinator, spoke at an anti-poverty event hosted by Stanford, the White House and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable institution the Facebook billionaire founded with his wife, Priscilla. Altman discussed the potential for basic income to alleviate poverty, but his speech veered back to the dark questions that hang over all this philanthropy: Is Silicon Valley about to put the world out of work? And if so, do technologists owe the world a solution?\u201cThere have been these moments where we have had these major technology revolutions \u2014 the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, for example \u2014 that have really changed the world in a big way,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the middle or at least on the cusp of another one.\u201dThe idea for the nonprofit came to Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus, who is now a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, when they were graduate students at Harvard. Both were studying development and doing fieldwork overseas, an experience that underlined an Economics 101 lesson: Cash was more valuable to its recipients than the in-kind gifts commonly distributed by aid groups, like food or bed nets or sports equipment. If you\u2019re hungry, you cannot eat a bed net. If your village is suffering from endemic diarrhea, soccer balls won\u2019t be worth much to you. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve been there, it\u2019s hard to imagine doing anything but cash,\u201d Faye told me. \u201cIt\u2019s so deeply uncomfortable to ask someone if they want cash or something else. They look at you like it\u2019s a trick question.\u201dBut at the time, distributing cash aid in a country with little to no banking infrastructure outside major cities would have required an extraordinary amount of manpower, not to mention introducing the risk of robbery and graft. But dirt-cheap mobile phones with pay-as-you-go minutes began flooding into sub-Saharan African markets in the 2000s. Enterprising Ghanaians, Kenyans and Nigerians started to use their minutes as a kind of currency. In 2007, Vodafone and the British Department for International Development together built a system, called M-Pesa, for Kenyans to transfer actual shillings from cellphone to cellphone. An estimated 96 percent of Kenyan households use the system today.Faye and Niehaus \u2014 along with their friends Rohit Wanchoo and Jeremy Shapiro, also graduate students \u2014 thought about setting up a website to raise cash in the United States and send it directly to poor Kenyans. But they never found a nonprofit that would distribute that cash abroad. They decided to do it themselves in 2008. \u201cBecause it was a start-up, and we started in grad school,\u201d Faye said, \u201cwe were open to the idea of it being wrong or failing.\u201dThe following year, Faye traveled to small Kenyan villages during the summer break, offering cash to whoever seemed poor and would take it. (The money, about $5,000, came out of the foursome\u2019s own pockets.) That, surprisingly, worked well enough to give them the confidence to start a threadbare randomized control trial the year they graduated. It found that the recipients, who received an average of $500, saw excellent outcomes: Their children were 42 percent less likely to go a whole day without eating. Domestic-violence rates dropped, and mental health improved.In time, the nonprofit attracted the attention of Silicon Valley and its deep-pocketed young philanthropists. Two Facebook founders gave six-figure donations. Then, in the spring of 2012, Faye went to a friend\u2019s brunch in Brooklyn and met someone working for Google.org, the tech giant\u2019s giving arm. She liked the sound of GiveDirectly and arranged for Faye and Niehaus to give a presentation at Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company ended up contributing $2.4 million.At first, GiveDirectly handed out large lump sums, generally $1,000 spread into three payments over the course of the year. The nonprofit\u2019s field officers would locate low-income villages in Kenya, then find the poorest families in each individual village using a simple asset test (whether a family had a thatched roof or not). The field officers would introduce themselves to the town elders, explain their purpose and return to provide mobile phones and training to recipient families. Then GiveDirectly would push a button and send the money out.The residents of this village had received money in 2013, and it was visibly better off than the basic-income pilot village. Its clearings were filled with mango plantings, its cows sturdy. A small lake on the outskirts had been lined with nets for catching fish. \u201cCould you imagine sitting in an office in London or New York trying to figure out what this village needs?\u201d Bassin said as he admired a well-fed cow tied up by the lakeside. \u201cIt would just be impossible.\u201dPerhaps, but delivering money by M-Pesa has some downsides, too. We visited an older woman named Anjelina Akoth Ngalo, her joints painful and swollen with advanced malaria. Sitting in her thatched-roof hut, she told us that she had received only one payment, not the three that she was promised. She had given her phone to a woman in a nearby village who transferred the money out of it. Ngalo visited the village elder to try to get her money back, but nothing had come of it. She was now destitute, living on about $5 a week. She had not eaten since the day before, and she had run out of malaria medication. (Bassin said that less than 1 percent of recipients experience theft, crime or conflict.)By giving money to some but not all, the organization had unwittingly strained the social fabric of some of these tight-knit tribal communities. One man we visited in a separate village nearby, Nicolus Owuor Otin, had acted as a liaison between the community and the GiveDirectly staff, showing them where different families\u2019 houses were, for instance. For that reason, he said, the other villagers thought he was determining who would get what and threatened to burn his house down.Still, nearly all the recipients described the money as transformative. Fredrick Omondi Auma \u2014 a Burning Spear devotee wearing a Rasta-style hat and bell bottoms when we visited \u2014 had been impoverished, drinking too much, abandoned by his wife and living in a mud hut when GiveDirectly knocked on his door. He used his money to buy a motorbike to give taxi rides. He also started a small business, selling soap, salt and paraffin in a local town center; he bought two cows, one of which had given birth; and he opened a barbershop in the coastal city Mombasa. His income had gone from 600 shillings a week to 2,500 shillings \u2014 roughly $25, a princely sum for the area. His wife had returned. He had even stopped drinking as much. \u201cI used to go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I\u2019d wake up in the bar with 100 shillings,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I wake up at home with 900.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I would be living in an iron-sheet house,\u201d he said, referring to his roof. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d be wearing nice shoes. I didn\u2019t imagine I would have a business, and earnings from it. I didn\u2019t imagine I would be a man who owns cattle.\u201dAll across the villages of western Kenya, it was clear to me just how much aid money was wasted on unnecessary stuff. The villagers had too many jerrycans and water tanks, because a nongovernmental organization kept bringing them. There was a thriving trade in Toms canvas slip-ons: People received them free from NGO workers and then turned around and sold them in the market centers. And none of the aid groups that had visited the villages managed to help the very poorest families.In the pilot-project village, for example, Faye and I paid a visit to a woman named Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo, who lives in a mud hut on the edge of town with her husband, Jack, a laborer, and her two small children. The most expensive thing she ever bought, she told me, was a chicken for 500 shillings, or about $5. Her family was persistently hungry. She knew of three nonprofit groups that had helped the village before GiveDirectly. One aided families with school fees, but it chose not to help her children. \u201cI do not want to talk about it,\u201d she said.What is worse, Faye told me, walking away from Odhiambo\u2019s hut, was that most nonprofit projects in the region were never subject to anything like an impact assessment, either. There is no way to know how well they are working, or whether that money would be better spent on something else. \u201cThe question should always be: Would we be better off just giving this money away as cash?\u201d Faye said. \u201cThere usually is not a way to answer that question.\u201dA vast majority of aid \u2014 94 percent \u2014 is noncash. Donor resistance is one reason for this; it is not easy to persuade American oligarchs, British inheritors and Japanese industrialists to fork over their money to the extremely poor to use as they see fit. \u201cThere\u2019s the usual worries about welfare dependency, the whole \u2018Give a man a fish\u2019 thing,\u201d said Amanda Glassman, a public health and development expert at the Center for Global Development. \u201cIt\u2019s so powerful. It\u2019s really a basic psychological feature of the landscape. You\u2019ll start drinking. You\u2019ll start lying around at home because you\u2019re getting paid.\u201dCash also seems harder to market. American taxpayers might be perfectly happy to fund education for young women in poor countries or vaccinations for schoolchildren. But they might balk at the idea of showering money on poor, unstable countries. \u201cThe visual of putting a pill in a kid\u2019s mouth is so much more attractive to people,\u201d Glassman said.Institutional inertia is another factor. \u201cThere are a lot of good people working in the system,\u201d Niehaus said. \u201cAnd there are a lot of organizations pushing to do cash transfers. But the way they are structured and incentivized from the top down \u2014 they aren\u2019t structured to do it. They have a specific mandate, like health. Cash transfers give choice of what goal to pursue to the recipients.\u201dMoreover, cash might force aid workers and nongovernmental organizations to confront the fact that they could be doing better by doing things differently \u2014 often by doing less. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to muster evidence that you should be giving cash instead of fertilizer,\u201d said Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development. \u201cThe harder argument is: You should shut down your U.S.A.I.D. program, which is bigger than the education budget of Liberia, and give the money to Liberians. That\u2019s the radical critique.\u201d Faye put it more bluntly, if half-jokingly: If cash transfers flourished, \u201cthe whole aid industry would have to fire itself.\u201dThere is something to that. One estimate, generated by Laurence Chandy and Brina Seidel of the Brookings Institution, recently calculated that the global poverty gap \u2014 meaning how much it would take to get everyone above the poverty line \u2014 was just $66 billion. That is roughly what Americans spend on lottery tickets every year, and it is about half of what the world spends on foreign aid.But here, many villagers were concerned primarily with procuring the sustenance and basic comforts that their penury had denied them. Odhiambo, the woman who had not been offered aid by the school group, planned to buy corrugated iron sheets for her roof; she considered possibly paying off her dowry. Another villager, Pamela Aooko Odero, ran a household that had been suffering from hunger, with all eight of them living on just 500 to 1,000 shillings a week. She took her money as soon as she got it and went to buy food.Many more made plans that were entrepreneurial. Two widowed sister-wives, Margaret Aloma Abagi and Mary Abonyo Abagi, told me they planned to pool their funds together to start a small bank with some friends. Charles Omari Ager, a houseboy for the sister-wives, had his phone turned off and wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket when the first text came in. He was driving the widows\u2019 goats and cattle from one dried-out, bramble-filled meadow to another when he happened upon an aid worker, who prompted him to pull out his phone, turn it on and wait. The text was there. The money was there. \u201cI\u2019m happy! I\u2019m happy! I\u2019m happy!\u201d he said. He bought himself a goat that day.When the nets were done, he told me, he would rent a boat and hire a day laborer to work with him. He anticipated that his income, after costs, might reach as much as 2,000 shillings on a good day. I asked him why he hadn\u2019t saved money for nets beforehand.He shrugged, smiled and said, \u201cI could not.\u201dAnnie Lowrey is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a former economic-policy reporter for The Times.

{"Headline": "Who Are the Richest of the Rich?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isn\u2019t a lot of money in 1997.Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, \u201cO.K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion.\u201dTwenty years after the movie \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d was released, billions of dollars aren\u2019t what they used to be, either.Bill Gates alone is just $10 billion shy of Dr. Evil\u2019s ransom demand, according to a list of the world\u2019s top 10 billionaires compiled by Wealth-X, a financial research firm. Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, tops the list at $89.3 billion, followed by his friend Warren Buffett at $73.5 billion.The top 10 \u2014 nine from the United States, one from Spain \u2014 have a combined net worth of $582 billion. While their wealth would certainly be enough to save the world from Dr. Evil, what they do with it in real life is the subject of great interest and debate.That is true now more than ever. Issues around money \u2014 like wealth inequality and talk of tax cuts for the rich \u2014 are among the hottest topics of the day. And the richest president in history is sitting in the Oval Office, with billionaires sprinkled throughout his cabinet.To some, today\u2019s billionaires are like Dr. Evil: selfish, rapacious and bent on world domination. To others, billionaires are worthy of respect for having put their names and fortunes behind an array of philanthropic endeavors, many aimed at improving the lives of people at the very base of the wealth pyramid.There were 2,473 billionaires in the world, as of Wealth-X\u2019s last count through 2015. That was a 6.4 percent increase in billionaires from the year before.But who these billionaires are and what they\u2019re like is more difficult to discern. Many may seem as ordinary as the guy sitting next to you on the train \u2014 or in Michael Bloomberg\u2019s case, standing beside you on the subway, when he was mayor of New York. (Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on Wealth-X\u2019s list.)There are certainly billionaires who want to save the world, like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bloomberg, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. Others in the top 10 are also philanthropic, but they are still focusing on their day jobs, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Alphabet (the parent of Google) \u2014 Nos. 4, 5 and 10.Yet many of the billionaires beyond the top 10 or 20 have a much lower profile. Who outside of finance or hockey knew of Vincent Viola, a former oil trader and current owner of the Florida Panthers, before President Trump nominated him to be secretary of the Army? Now that he has withdrawn, he can return to relative anonymity.For that matter, Wilbur L. Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, is the wealthiest of the president\u2019s billionaire cabinet picks. He would pop up in the headlines every few years for a deal he was making but then return to what could be called the quiet opulence of the billionaire class.\u201cThey\u2019re different in how they can invest their assets and what their portfolio may look like,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said. \u201cIn many ways, they face different risks, both personal risks and cyber risks, than the average individual does. They often think about structuring decisions differently from a succession-planning standpoint as well as the structure they create around themselves and their family.\u201dYet for most people, billionaires are just wealthy beyond belief. And these days, they are also much wealthier (and getting even more so) than the broader ultra-high-net-worth population.That group is defined as anyone with more than $30 million. In 2015, there were 212,615 of them. On the lower end, the 155,050 people worth between $30 million and $99 million had a combined $8.4 trillion. At the top, the world\u2019s 2,473 billionaires were worth $7.68 trillion.\u201cThere is growing inequality around the world, but there is also inequality among the ultrawealthy,\u201d said Maya Imberg, director of custom research at Wealth-X.Billionaires also matter because of the outsize influence they have, or believe they can have, on policy and public life. They can give millions to a political campaign, as Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, did with Mr. Trump, or as George Soros, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has done with liberal causes.But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group. How they amassed their billions, and how that pile is growing, tells a lot about the economy today.Just as the best teacher in the country is going to earn less money than a mediocre investment banker, the industries in which future billionaires begin their careers determine the magnitude of their wealth and how quickly it is going to grow.Six of the top 10 billionaires made their money in technology. But in Wealth-X\u2019s research, technology ranks sixth overall for the number of billionaires on the list, with 114 around the world.Finance has created the most billionaires, with 377, or 15 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires. It is followed by industrial conglomerates, with 317, or 13 percent.After that, the concentration in particular industries drops. Real estate is third with 141. The group of people who identify their industry as nonprofits (meaning they made their money some other way or inherited it) is fourth, with 122. Manufacturing, in fifth place, has 120.\u201cGlobalization has been a big trend,\u201d said Benjamin Kinnard, a research analyst at Wealth-X. \u201cThe market is now seven billion people, not just the size of your domestic country.\u201dHe added that finance had a bigger lead in first place several years ago, but it has been losing ground as industries like technology boom.A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other people\u2019s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified.The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance.And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts).While the number of billionaires in China is rising at a fast clip, the pace of growth in billionaires worldwide is slowing. Wealth-X said the number will be 3,250 by 2020, down 16 percent from an earlier prediction of 3,873. This is because economic growth is expected to slow around the world.Across the billionaire spectrum, the biggest proportion of billionaires\u2019 wealth \u2014 about half \u2014 is in the business that created the wealth in the first place, according to Wealth-X\u2019s research. After that, they have about a quarter of their money in public securities and a little less than a quarter in cash. Just 4 percent is in real estate and luxury assets, the research found.There are common strains to how they cross the billionaire line, regardless of industry: 57 percent are self-made, according to Wealth-X, and another 31 percent received an inheritance and grew it into billions.\u201cTiming has a lot to do with it,\u201d said John Mathews, head of private wealth management and the ultra-high-net-worth group at UBS. \u201cIf we looked back 100 years, it would have been a really great time to be in steel, railroad or infrastructure businesses. Today, it\u2019s a good time to be in technology and finance.\u201dBut there is a difference from the bottom of the billionaire ladder to the top: Most are on that first rung.Over half of all billionaires are worth between $1 billion and $2 billion. Go up to $5 billion and there are 2,101.And not all billionaires are household names.Ma Jianrong, executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group Holdings, which is the leading textile company in China and manufactures clothing for Nike, Adidas, Puma and Uniqlo, is worth $4.3 billion.Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, built his wealth through mining in South Africa after starting his career as a lawyer in the United States. He is now worth $2.1 billion.Kevin Systrom, chief executive of Instagram, is surely well known in Silicon Valley \u2014 and among students at Stanford University (his alma mater) who want to emulate his route to a net worth of $1.2 billion by age 33. But he is not as recognizable as Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook.But being a billionaire, as opposed to a very wealthy millionaire, can make a huge difference in the loss of privacy for a family. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to be anonymous,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said.And being known as billionaires opens them up to risks, she said, like cybersecurity breaches and attacks on their families.How single-digit billionaires add additional billions isn\u2019t always up to them.One way to become even wealthier is to have picked the right global industry in which to make your billions and hang on to your stake in your company as it booms \u2014 and avoids busts. Right now, the technology and finance industries are leading the growth. Another way is to make your money in the right region, which is Asia.Then, of course, there are the investment opportunities that only get presented to the wealthiest people, and that only they have the resources to take a chance on. \u201cThey can diversify their holdings to protect themselves,\u201d Mr. Kinnard said.And the big investments that are needed in private equity deals, for example, are a smaller portion of overall wealth for billionaires than for someone with, say, $100 million.\u201cThe common thread with billionaires is the incredibly focused drive these people have in whatever business they go into,\u201d Mr. Mathews said. \u201cIt\u2019s dogged determination. You can say everyone is like that, but with billionaires everything else gets blocked out. You see it today with tech the way you saw it with steel barons 100 years ago.\u201dYet getting across the billionaire line does not mean a person will always be there.\u201cOnce a billionaire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stay a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Mathews of UBS said. \u201cLast year alone there were 41 new billionaires created in the United States, but 36 also dropped out of billionaire status in the U.S. Our billionaire population is growing but only by a net of five.\u201dIn the United States, Mr. Mathews said, most people fall off the billionaire list because they sell the company that created their wealth. \u201cWhen you sell it, there are tax issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are estate-planning issues.\u201dThe latter results in chunks of money being given to heirs to get it out of the wealth creator\u2019s estate.Selling family firms happens less often in Europe and Asia. People end up holding on to them and creating family holding companies to continue to operate that original business and expand into others.Of course, people who sell their $1 billion company and end up with $500 million after taxes \u2014 or whose wealth tops out at $800 million \u2014 aren\u2019t scraping by. But being a billionaire gives you entry into an exclusive club that being a millionaire does not. After all, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s wealth from his career at Exxon Mobil looks positively modest. He\u2019s worth just a few hundred million.What is expected of people who have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes? It depends on whom you ask.\u201cIt is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when one in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day,\u201d Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam, said in a statement. \u201cInequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty. It is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.\u201dYet the anger against the superrich has abated since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Protesters seem to be more concerned with the actions of Mr. Trump (who is likely a billionaire, although he has provided little proof of his real wealth) than with his cabinet of plutocrats.Philanthropy has become important to many billionaires, and not just through the Giving Pledge, Mr. Buffett\u2019s compact to get the wealthiest to give away at least half of their fortunes. Nor is it confined to the United States, with its tradition of charitable giving.\u201cWhen I explained to him that New York City\u2019s annual school budget was $22 billion a year,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, \u201cthat was the last time we ever heard from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. LaRue first met Ms. McClanahan at an animal rights charity event at Studio 54. They quickly became best friends, he said, and she repeatedly asked him, in jest, to marry her so she could be Rue LaRue.

The bathroom was outfitted to match the show\u2019s pink and mint tiles, with a bawdy door Ms. McClanahan had designed for her California house. The banana leaf Martinique wallpaper on two walls was hand-cut to match its exact look in Blanche\u2019s bedroom.CHOCnyc, an Inwood bakery, created a cheesecake in honor of each Girl, and the Bronx Brewery provided two custom beers.

{"Headline": "The Economic Growth That Experts Can\u2019t Count", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut what if the economy has already been growing at that rate \u2014 but no one realized it?This isn\u2019t a matter of rigged statistics, political spinning or fanciful alternate realities, but one of measurement.As the economy has shifted from one that primarily produced things \u2014 refrigerators and cars, guns and shoes \u2014 to one that now deals largely in services and information, economists have grown more and more skeptical that the traditional measure of gross domestic product \u2014 the nation\u2019s total output \u2014 is accurately capturing much of the economy\u2019s innovation and improvements.\u201cI think the official data on real growth substantially underestimates the rate of growth,\u201d said Martin Feldstein, an economist at Harvard.These calculations may seem to be the esoteric domain of number crunchers, but the yearly growth figures \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 end up being used to answer several essential questions. Is the country getting richer? Are standards of living rising? Are businesses and workers more productive? Is the economy improving?Indeed, the measure was initially created to back up President Herbert Hoover\u2019s overly buoyant claim in 1930, based solely on sprinkled anecdotes of improvements, that \u201cthe Depression is over.\u201dGross domestic product has always been an imperfect answer to such questions. It is designed to measure production and just production \u2014 not welfare or happiness.Such ho-hum performance has become both an emblem of and explanation for the anxiety that smears the economic outlook like a bathtub ring. And every day, decisions about government policy, investment, regulations, taxes, trade and more are based on such measurements.At its most basic, G.D.P. is calculated by looking at prices \u2014 the price of materials, workers, overhead and so on that it costs to make a product and the price that consumers in turn pay for that product.And while prices can be measured, they don\u2019t necessarily reflect the value of quality and experience. As far as G.D.P. is concerned, a delectable $20 meal that would wow Julia Child is equal to a rubbery, tasteless one that costs the same amount.The growing suspicion, however, is that in a digital world overflowing with free services like Facebook, Google and YouTube, price is an increasingly ill-suited proxy for value.What is the worth of a free software update that protects against a nasty virus? Of the streaming service that enables you to watch shows on your computer instead of on a television? Of the hours and hours saved by looking up a fact on Wikipedia rather than having to go to a library? All have productive value but no price.Kuznets lost that battle, but economists and statisticians have continually struggled to compensate for the measure\u2019s shortcomings \u2014 like qualities not reflected in price and the constant cavalcade of new goods and services.Economists seek to attach values to specific improvements, whether faster internet speed, less pollution or a medical treatment that leaves you healthy enough to water ski instead of stuck in a hospital bed. And they look at ad revenue that free services like Google and Facebook rack up and jobs they create.Still, given how much of people\u2019s time and activity has migrated online, there remains a sizable chunk of \u201cdigital dark matter\u201d that is not counted. At the same time, measuring the increased value to consumers can be even more difficult when it comes to services and experience than it is with goods.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to evaluate consumer preferences,\u201d said Richard Freeman, an economist at Harvard, and it may be even harder to figure for \u201cthings where knowledge is involved and for some kind of qualitative changes.\u201dThe best biology textbook in the 1950s, for example, would still not have the accuracy, depth and complexity of one published in 2017. \u201cA doctor who graduates today knows and learns many more techniques and medicines than someone who graduated years ago,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t really build that in.\u201dMr. Feldstein likes to illustrate his argument about G.D.P. by referring to the widespread use of statins, the cholesterol drugs that have reduced deaths from heart attacks. Between 2000 and 2007, he noted, the death rate from heart disease among those over 65 fell by one-third.\u201cThis was a remarkable contribution to the public\u2019s well-being over a relatively short number of years, and yet this part of the contribution of the new product is not reflected in real output or real growth of G.D.P.,\u201d he said. He estimates \u2014 without hard evidence, he is careful to point out \u2014 that growth is understated by 2 percent or more a year.The critical question, though, is whether growth and productivity figures are being underestimated more than ever before.Mr. Furman said that Americans were feeling a genuine slowdown in growth, but aggravating the impact was that the growth that had occurred \u201cis less equally shared than before.\u201dFor Mr. Feldstein, it is misleading measurements that are contributing to a public perception that real incomes \u2014 particularly for the middle class \u2014 aren\u2019t rising very much. That, he said, \u201creduces people\u2019s faith in the political and economic system.\u201d\u201cI think it creates pessimism and a distrust of government,\u201d leading Americans to worry that \u201ctheir children are going to be stuck and won\u2019t be able to enjoy upward mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand this.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Parent Showcases Its Strength in Preparation for I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Snapchat may have been built on disappearing messages. But as the social media darling hovers on the cusp of becoming a public company, its parent is trying to show how durable its business is.In its first public prospectus, Snap Inc. disclosed on Thursday that it had built a nearly $405 million advertising business in just over two years. While the filing does not indicate a price for an initial public offering, Snap is expected to seek a market valuation of more than $20 billion from investors.Within weeks, Snap executives will begin formally meeting with prospective investors, along with the company\u2019s lead underwriters at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The pitch is straightforward: Snap is one of technology\u2019s biggest success stories of late, and it is heading to the public markets amid a relative dearth of noteworthy offerings.Still, company executives are expected to face questions about whether Snap can maintain its enormous growth rate, particularly as Facebook\u2019s Instagram unit copies many of Snapchat\u2019s major features. Potential investors may question the slowing growth rate of daily users, though Snap will probably argue that it will keep adding new products, which will accelerate growth.Others in Snap\u2019s class of popular start-ups \u2014 like Uber, Airbnb and Dropbox \u2014 are not expected to begin selling stock on public markets for months or even years, as they are tied up with legal issues or are overhauling their businesses.The filing on Thursday formally pulls back the curtain on Snap\u2019s meteoric growth. From 2011 to 2012, the number of people using the Snapchat app every day grew to one million from 1,000. By the end of last year, an average of 158 million people were using the app daily.The average user opens the app more than 18 times a day, according to the prospectus, and the service\u2019s users send more than 2.5 billion messages and images each day.Snap demonstrated in the prospectus that its business model is viable. Its annual revenue grew by about seven times in just a year, to $404.5 million last year, from $58.7 million in 2015.Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising conglomerate WPP, recently estimated that his company spent $90 million on Snapchat last year. He called Snap a \u201crogue elephant,\u201d even as WPP deployed $5 billion to Google and $1.7 billion to Facebook in 2016.\u201cI would say Snapchat is the one thing that people look at and say, \u2018Maybe that\u2019s a third force that can counter the domination,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sorrell said last month, speaking at a conference held by Citigroup.Still, Snap lost $514 million last year, compared with nearly $373 million in 2015. One difference between Snap and its rivals Facebook and Twitter makes it hard to compare their financials side by side: Those older social networks own their own server farms, so the expense of operating them does not show up as a line item in the companies\u2019 financial statements. By contrast, Snap rents storage and server space from Google.In its first public prospectus, Snapchat\u2019s parent is trying to show how durable its business is. Snap is expected to seek a market valuation of more than $20 billion from investors.In the prospectus, Snap said that nearly all of its revenue came from advertising, a market that is expected to grow globally to $767 billion in 2020 from $652 billion in 2016. The fastest-growing segment of that market is mobile advertising, the home of Snap\u2019s business. The segment is expected to grow to $196 billion in 2020 from $66 billion last year.The ad market is highly concentrated in 10 countries, according to data from International Data Corporation, and about 60 percent of Snap\u2019s users are in those countries.By the end of 2016, the prospectus says, Snap made $1.05 for each of its users, up from 31 cents in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company made $2.15 per user in North America in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with 67 cents the year before. In Europe, by comparison, the company made 28 cents per user at the end of last year.Started in 2011 in a Stanford dorm room, Snap has grown from a curio for millennials into a broad social phenomenon. The start-up, founded by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, was originally built for users to send self-destructing photographs and messages to their friendsBut Snap\u2019s ambitions have risen over time. It introduced ways for users to compile \u201cstories\u201d about their days and innovative filters that can transform faces to look like dogs or monsters \u2014 or, crucially, branded content like Taco Bell tacos.\u201cWhen we were just getting started, many people didn\u2019t understand what Snapchat was and said it was just for sexting, even when we knew it was being used for so much more,\u201d the company said, employing what is surely one of the few uses of the word \u201csexting\u201d in a regulatory filing.While generally seen as a social media company like Facebook and Twitter, Snap declared in its prospectus that it \u201cis a camera company.\u201dUnlike Facebook or Twitter, Snap has largely avoided many of the standard trappings of Silicon Valley. Its home base in not a Bay Area enclave like Menlo Park or Palo Alto, but off the beach in Venice, a Los Angeles neighborhood. Snap employs 1,859 people \u2014 an extraordinarily small number relative to the $16.5 billion valuation it gave itself as of the end of 2016.Mr. Spiegel\u2019s vision has attracted a number of prominent backers who are expected to reap handsome rewards \u2014 if only on paper \u2014 in the initial public offering.According to the filing, Mr. Spiegel received $4.1 million in compensation, including salary and bonuses, over the last two years. The company\u2019s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, received $151 million in that period, with the bulk of it coming from stock awards he got upon joining the company from the investment bank Credit Suisse.Among the largest current owners of Snap stock are Benchmark Capital, which owns about 12.7 percent of the company\u2019s class A shares, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which owns about 8 percent of that stock class.But the biggest shareholders by far are Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy. More important, they hold nearly 89 percent of the company\u2019s voting power, and will keep it even after the initial offering, since the shares being sold to the public will hold no voting power whatsoever. The men will retain that control even if they should later leave the company.\u201cMr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are entitled to vote their shares, and shares over which they have voting control, in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally,\u201d the company cautioned in the filing. Snap noted that it knew of no other company that had completed an offering of nonvoting stock in the United States.Sapna Maheshwari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mike Piazza Learns How to Be an Owner. Of a Soccer Team. In Italy.", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREGGIO EMILIA, Italy \u2014 Mike Piazza was jet-lagged and hungry, though you wouldn\u2019t have known it from his smile as he navigated the obstacle course of hugs, kisses and handshakes.\u201cHey! Ciao! Good to see you!\u201d he said.It has been 10 years since Piazza, 48, retired from baseball as one of the best-hitting catchers in history. It is common for stars of his stature to try out second careers in broadcasting, or simply to luxuriate in endless rounds of golf. Piazza last year decided he would become the majority owner of a third-division Italian soccer club, Reggiana.And so today, one year after his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the focus of Piazza\u2019s professional life is here in Reggio Emilia, a picturesque city 100 miles south of Milan \u2014 and about 5,000 miles from his home in Miami. Here, most people view the American pastime, if they know it at all, as a faraway curiosity. The locals understood that Piazza was famous when he arrived, but they needed Google to discover the reason. The level of renown he earns here will depend entirely on his ability to execute an ambitious plan to lift his beleaguered club back to the top flight of Italian soccer.So he kept moving on that recent Sunday morning, doling out bilingual small talk around the V.I.P. lounge of Reggiana\u2019s stadium before a recent game against Modena, a nearby rival. Cigarette smoke and the faint echoes of fans\u2019 chants wafted in from the stands. Parmigiano-Reggiano from a local sponsor was carved and shoveled onto plates of pumpkin tortellini. Finally, palms pressed and pleasantries exchanged, Piazza stole away to a modest private box where he could reflect on his professional transformation.\u201cI remember, as a player, complaining if we had a small plane,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018We couldn\u2019t get a 757? We had to get a 737? That\u2019s garbage. The owners are cheap.\u2019\u201d\u201cNow switch to me as the owner. I go: \u2018What the hell? One hundred dollars a room? Where are you guys staying, the Four Seasons?\u2019\u201dAs the game began, Piazza found himself fixated on how the rainy weather had affected ticket sales. While play crackled below him, he timed a rotating advertisement screen near the stands. Soon, Maurizio Franzone, the team\u2019s general manager, joined Piazza and his guests in the outdoor viewing area, and for the next two hours Piazza peppered him with questions about players and tactics.It was Franzone who first made contact with Reggiana\u2019s previous owners on Dec. 10, 2015. Piazza and Franzone have been friends for years, and they had long discussed the idea of investing in soccer. After the initial meeting, Franzone, who had spoken to about 20 other clubs in Italy, excitedly reported back to Piazza that it could be the perfect situation. Reggiana played in a large stadium that could eventually accommodate upper-league crowds. It boasted a training facility with 11 fields. It was geographically close to countless potential sponsors. It possessed a fan base desperate for brighter days.\u201cPut it this way: This is a team that needs to come back,\u201d said Franzone, 47, a former professional goalkeeper who favors three-piece suits and a finely groomed beard. \u201cThe people of Reggio Emilia need it.\u201dIt has not been easy being a Reggiana fan over the last two decades. In the 1990s, the club played in Serie A, the country\u2019s top tier, and in 1995, it opened a new stadium, which hundreds of the team\u2019s fans helped finance through the purchase of multiyear season ticket plans.But things quickly went awry. The team was relegated in 1997, and a few years later, after going bankrupt, it was forced to surrender the title to its stadium, which had been sold at auction. Today, the arena is owned by Giorgio Squinzi, the owner of the nearby Serie A team Sassuolo. The teams share the stadium, with Reggiana paying rent \u2014 an arrangement that causes its fans much embarrassment.But Piazza, for now, has gained the fans\u2019 trust. On June 18, 10 days after he announced a deal in principle to buy a majority stake in the club, thousands of fans greeted him with a rally in the main city square, serenading him with team songs. (He has declined to disclose financial details of the deal, but various local media outlets reported the investment was around $3 million.)And if there was some initial concern that Piazza might be a detached foreign owner, minding his investment from overseas, he has thus far dispelled it. He has made seven trips to Italy since buying the team, embracing a life of redeye flights. He has adopted a holistic approach to player development and pondered which elements of American sports culture could work in Italy. New sponsors have signed on; old ones that had abandoned the club in its lean years have returned. The number of season-ticket holders has doubled to 5,243, up from 2,615 last season.Currently Reggiana (14-5-7) sits in fourth place in the league standings.\u201cWe firmly believe in the Mike Piazza project,\u201d said Stefano Cavazzoni, 46, who lives in Reggio Emilia and began following the team in the early 1980s.\u201cHe made us feel close to him even though he\u2019s a very wealthy man,\u201d Miari said. He shrugged when asked to rate Piazza\u2019s language skills. \u201cHis Italian is like our English,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs practice.\u201dPiazza, who took six months of Italian lessons (and acknowledges that he needs more), has been brushing up on his soccer, too. He grew up near Philadelphia and had only a passing interest in the sport until he retired. He joked that he once thought Reggiana\u2019s favored formation was a 4-4-3, a nonsensical configuration. But Franzone said Piazza\u2019s baseball career had given him credibility with players and fans alike. \u201cThey know you know the smell of a locker room,\u201d he often tells Piazza.Sports ownership has its visceral joys, too, and Piazza was clearly enjoying himself as the game wore on. He yelled toward the field: \u201cDai, dai! Atta boy! Bravo! Get that ball!\u201d He drank an Aperol spritz and a few glasses of ros\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a bad headache,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we pull this game out, it\u2019ll be worth it. It\u2019s two Advil.\u201dThe conversation at halftime turned to the region\u2019s famous gastronomic tradition, or as Piazza called it, \u201cthe other reason I bought the team.\u201d He breathlessly cataloged the area\u2019s cured meats: \u201cThe prosciutto, the bresaola, the coppa, the mortadella \u2014 that\u2019s all here.\u201dNoting that he had met with groups aiming for expansion franchises in Major League Soccer before buying Reggiana, he said: \u201cI\u2019d rather be poor in Italy than based in St. Louis. You can\u2019t get a good meal there!\u201dWhen Reggiana scored its eventual winning goal in the second half, Piazza threw a left-handed uppercut \u2014 balancing the wineglass in his other hand \u2014 and let out a prolonged yell. He cursed when a Reggiana player injured himself and again when the fourth official announced that there would be four minutes of injury time.\u201cYeah!\u201d Piazza said when the final whistle blared, before closing his eyes and touching his chest. \u201cMamma mia.\u201dAfterward, several fans walked over to greet Piazza, addressing him as \u201cPresidente\u201d \u2014 the formality of which always makes his wife, Alicia Rickter, laugh. Piazza shook hands and posed for pictures. \u201cGrazie per essere venuti,\u201d he said. Thank you for coming.As he prepared to duck inside, an elderly man reached over to grab his hand. \u201cYou bring us good luck,\u201d the man said in Italian. \u201cPlease come again.\u201dThe next day, while eating lunch with Franzone in the city, Piazza likened owning a soccer team to harvesting macadamia trees, a process that can take five years to yield nuts. \u201cI wanted to come into a situation where there was something to build,\u201d he said.Piazza has adopted the same approach to life in Italy. He was 34 when he visited Italy for the first time. He had been to Japan seven times at that point in his life, but somehow never to the home country of his paternal grandparents.The trip changed him, he said. Growing up, he had absorbed a bundle of cultural idiosyncrasies \u2014 whether tastes, mannerisms or locutions \u2014 that sometimes manifested themselves explicitly or in other cases merely fizzed beneath his consciousness. In Rome, he found these stray fragments of his identity fitting naturally, exhilaratingly, into his surroundings.The next year, he and his father visited Sciacca, the town on the southwestern coast of Sicily where his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Giuseppe Piazza was born in 1789.\u201cI felt like a duck going back to water,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cI just related. I could just feel it. I just felt Italian.\u201dThese days, Piazza has been renting a home in a village called Quattro Castella, about 10 miles south of Reggio Emilia. He has considered having his children \u2014 Nicoletta, 10; Paulina, 7; and Marco, 3 \u2014 attend Italian schools for a year.In the restaurant, Piazza fiddled with the patterned scarf around his neck, joking that he accessorized like this only in Italy, where he felt sartorially inadequate alongside the locals. Scanning a menu, he made a face when he came across the horse tartare; his children were taking riding lessons, he explained.Piazza is enjoying this cross-cultural learning process. He said the rigors of this new life \u2014 stacking airline miles, struggling with a new language, savoring new foods, connecting to his family\u2019s roots \u2014 had invigorated him in the vacuum left by baseball.\u201cI played baseball for 16 years,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to reconcile the fact that I\u2019ll never again feel the juice of hitting a home run in front of 50,000 people.\u201dTo be sure, baseball still seeped into conversation during the first two days of his trip. Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and Byung-Hyun Kim were the two pitchers he never figured out. He thought the increasing reliance on \u201cMoneyball\u201d principles had precipitated his retirement. He called being booed at Yankee Stadium \u201cthe coolest thing I remember from my career.\u201dBut it is soccer, calcio, that consumes him now. \u201cI like the adventure of this,\u201d he said of the Reggiana project. \u201cI\u2019ll hop on a train. I\u2019ll hop on a plane. I\u2019ll get in the car. I\u2019ll just go. I like the energy.\u201dHe sipped Lambrusco, a sparkling red wine produced in the region. \u201cI could fail,\u201d he said. \u201cI could end up losing some money here. But it was important to me to step outside of my comfort zone.\u201dBrando de Leonardis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "November\u2019s Book Club Pick: \u2018A Separation,\u2019 by Katie Kitamura", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Read ThisWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When I was young, I felt a high-minded scorn for the whodunits my elders favored: mystery novels that inducted you into the specificities of British racecourses or Native American reservations while satisfying the same itch for neat solutions as my father\u2019s games of solitaire, my mother\u2019s crossword puzzles. Back then, suspense struck me as a cheap trick, like tickling the sole of a baby\u2019s foot or cooking with scads of butter. The novels I loved occasionally included a murder \u2014 sometimes even a police inspector whose investigation actually produced the culprit \u2014 but the real question at stake wasn\u2019t \u201cWho killed the old bastard?\u201d but \u201cIs there a God, and if there isn\u2019t, why should we be good?\u201dNow that I\u2019m older, I have a grudging respect for the mystery novel and its resourceful practitioners, writers whose art depends on catching the world-weary reader unawares. Suddenly I too can see the point of having my questions answered, the teasing threads unknotted, cases closed.Katie Kitamura would seem to share my youthful disregard for closure. In her third novel, \u201cA Separation,\u201d she has created a kind of postmodern mystery in which we end up with a dead body, evidence of a violent crime, an abundant trail of clues and even angry mourners, yet nobody feels compelled to pursue the investigation. There is something unknowable in human nature, the novel seems to assume, something better left unexamined. \u201cOnce you begin to pick at the seams,\u201d we are told, \u201call deaths are unresolved.\u201d\u201cA Separation\u201d is narrated by an unnamed 30-ish woman about whose history we learn very little; even her nationality is unspecified, though we\u2019re told that fellow Londoners regard her as \u201cforeign.\u201d The story opens with an imperious phone call from the woman\u2019s mother-in-law. Where is her son and why isn\u2019t he answering his phone? What Kitamura\u2019s narrator doesn\u2019t tell the older woman is that she and Christopher have been separated for six months, an estrangement he has made her promise to keep secret for reasons that she \u2014 and we \u2014 will never know.Christopher is a rich, clever, charming Englishman, the author of a much-praised social history of music. For years since its publication, he has talked about writing a second book, this time about worldwide rituals of mourning, a subject that has recently seemed to grip him with a new urgency. \u201cIt was a strange project for a man who had hitherto lost nothing of significance,\u201d his wife reflects. \u201cNot even a pet dog, a man who had no conception of what real loss must feel like.\u201d His mother has tracked Christopher down to the southern Peloponnese, where he has evidently gone to research the \u201cweepers,\u201d professional mourners who are still, according to local tradition, paid to ululate at funerals. \u201cYou know how powerful my intuition is,\u201d his mother persists. \u201cI know something is wrong, it\u2019s not like him not to return my calls.\u201dThe narrator doesn\u2019t share her mother-in-law\u2019s concern. Her husband, she\u2019s discovered, is a compulsive philanderer, and she has finally gotten sick of his infidelities, his fakeries. But because of her own deception-by-omission, her inability to say that she and her husband are separated, the young woman finds herself agreeing to fly to Greece to track him down in the out-of-season beach resort where he has apparently been holed up for the last few weeks. It\u2019s a long way to travel and she\u2019s never had any desire to see Greece, but, she tells herself, \u201cI supposed it would be my last dutiful act\u201d as a daughter-in-law. When she and Christopher come face-to-face, she intends to ask him for a divorce.Kitamura\u2019s previous novel, \u201cGone to the Forest,\u201d was set during a colonial revolt in a nameless country in an undefined era. The geographical setting of \u201cA Separation\u201d is Google Maps specific: The book\u2019s action unfolds in the fishing village of Gerolimenas on the Mani Peninsula. Yet the same austere indeterminacy, the same allegorical quality that haunted Kitamura\u2019s earlier fiction is also at work here. In \u201cGone to the Forest,\u201d the unspecified country was devastated by a volcanic eruption that smothered the land in \u201ca blizzard of ash.\u201d \u201cA Separation\u201d features forest fires that have similarly reduced the countryside to \u201cmounds of burnt charcoal, a lunar landscape\u201d that emits a stench \u201cso heavy you could barely breathe.\u201d While the earlier narrative took place on a white landowner\u2019s farm, worked and surrounded by \u201cnatives,\u201d \u201cA Separation\u201d depicts a postcolonial form of colonialism: a luxury resort planted in a poor traditional society that\u2019s been devastated by the Great Recession, a resort in which the only interaction of the guests with their host culture is service-based, and where, as the narrator soon discovers, a taxi driver or receptionist\u2019s efforts at human kindness are regarded by their \u201cbigoted\u201d clientele merely as efforts to extract more money from them.Much as the narrator might like to remove the strictures of these power relations and escape into something more spontaneous, she\u2019s trapped by her own inability to trust the people around her. Oddly, the most emotionally charged scene in the novel occurs when, having invited the young hotel receptionist (with whom she suspects Christopher has had a flirtation) to dinner, the narrator dissolves into seething resentment when her guest orders the most ostentatiously expensive items on the menu. Fuming, she watches as the other woman \u201csucked the meat out of the lobster\u2019s claw, her chin growing slick with butter,\u201d then devours her steak with a \u201ccarnal satisfaction.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d the narrator recognizes, \u201cI knew even then that it wasn\u2019t her order or the meal that I was going to pay for. This was all just a cipher for another infraction.\u201dIt is this radical disbelief \u2014 a disbelief, it appears, even in the power of art \u2014 that makes Kitamura\u2019s accomplished novel such a coolly unsettling work.Fernanda Eberstadt is the author of five novels and one work of nonfiction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Traffic Deaths Rise for a Second Straight Year", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the last decade, new cars have gotten electronic stability control systems to prevent skids, rearview cameras to prevent fender benders and more airbags to protect occupants in collisions. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on campaigns to remind the public of the dangers of drunken driving, failing to buckle up and texting while on the go.Despite all that, more Americans are dying on roads and highways than in years, and the sudden and sharp increase has alarmed safety advocates.If the estimates are confirmed, it will be the first time since 2007 that more than 40,000 people have died in motor vehicle accidents in a single year. The 2016 total comes after a 7 percent rise in 2015 and means the two-year increase \u2014 14 percent \u2014 is the largest in more than a half a century.\u201cWhy are we O.K. with this?\u201d Deborah Hersman, the National Safety Council president and chief executive, said at a news conference. \u201cComplacency is killing us.\u201dPart of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing.They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers\u2019 eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist.\u201cIt\u2019s not just talking on the phone that\u2019s a problem today,\u201d said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. \u201cYou now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones.\u201dGovernment officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures.A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped. Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense \u2014 meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense \u2014 drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations.\u201cIt\u2019s still the same things that are killing drivers \u2014 belts, booze and speed,\u201d Mr. Adkins said.About half of all traffic fatalities involve unbelted occupants, and almost a third involve drivers who were impaired by drugs or alcohol, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal government\u2019s main auto-safety agency.In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the state\u2019s 103,000 miles of highways. David Brown, a research associate at the University of Alabama\u2019s Center for Advanced Public Safety, studied the state\u2019s 2016 traffic fatality reports and found an increase in fatalities involving high-speed crashes.\u201cTotal crashes were up less than 5 percent, but fatalities were up 25 percent,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and there\u2019s no one there to deter it.\u201dIn some states, highway speed limits are rising. In recent years, Texas has increased speed limits to 85 miles per hour in some rural areas. About 1,500 miles of roads have a limit of 75 miles per hour or higher.But others say that more needs to be done now on basic road safety issues. \u201cThe way to bring down the rise in deaths is with a wide range of the nuts-and-bolts measures, not self-driving cars,\u201d the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in an interview in October.Mr. Nader said states could reduce traffic deaths simply by requiring rear-seat occupants to wear seatbelts, installing more cameras to catch speeding drivers without a police presence and tightening regulations on heavy trucking.The council is also advocating mandatory motorcycle helmet laws and ignition locks that prevent repeat drunken drivers from operating their vehicles while impaired.The safety council\u2019s figures typically correspond closely to the fatality totals that the N.H.T.S.A. compiles, but they include accidents off public roads and deaths occurring over a longer period after a crash.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Esquire Man\u2019 Is Dead. Long Live the \u2018Esquire Man.\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "Esquire magazine, long the man\u2019s bible, looks to chart a new course in an era of transgender bathrooms and pink hats.Supported by\u201cThere was a period of time when Esquire had a real literary charisma, and there was a culture that responded to it,\u201d said Mr. Fielden, 48, sounding nostalgic as he reclined in a banquette, wearing a steel-bluel Ferragamo suit and sporting what may be the best head of male hair in the magazine industry, a cascade of artfully coifed curls that calls to mind both the belletrist whimsy of Oscar Wilde and the gunslinger gusto of Wild Bill Hickok. \u201cHow do you make that urgent to a younger generation?\u201dIt is up to the 13th editor in Esquire\u2019s history to decide if this is a crisis or an opportunity.Seated in a glassy Esquire conference room on the 21st floor of the Hearst Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Fielden described how the fire and smoke, which was like \u201cexploding 50 cans of spray paint,\u201d destroyed perhaps 80 percent of his family\u2019s possessions.\u201cYour first response is, \u2018All our stuff!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut the point is, it was oddly freeing. Subliminally, we all do things to preserve the status quo. The major lesson that has helped me as an editor is to realize not to hang on to the things that would keep you from doing something dangerous.\u201dA portly Everyman with an impish wit, Mr. Corden is at heart a disrupter, Mr. Fielden said, the kind of man who looks totally at home in a red custom-made Gucci suit and silk Gucci loafers embroidered with tigers, as he appears in the issue.\u201cI mean, here\u2019s this bloke from England who\u2019s a little overweight, with his zaftig charisma showing up, taking the latest slot that potheads and college students watch, and suddenly he\u2019s become a viral sensation that\u2019s global,\u201d Mr. Fielden said, a trace of his Texas twang poking through.That talk show host was hardly the only peacock to grace the pages of that issue.\u201cThere\u2019s no cigar smoke wafting through the pages,\u201d Mr. Fielden said, \u201cand the obligatory three B\u2019s are gone, too \u2014 brown liquor, boxing and bullfighting.\u201dAs a straight white man, Mr. Fielden does not exactly represent a departure for the top of the Esquire masthead. Indeed, his profile is almost too perfect for the job. Craggily handsome in a vaguely Willem Dafoe way, he grew up in San Antonio with a father who enjoyed hunting and fly fishing, so he has the \u201carts of manhood\u201d element deep in his DNA.His ability to cross boundaries was on display at Town & Country, a magazine associated with ladies who lunch, where Mr. Fielden managed to increase revenues 46 percent over his five-year reign there, in part by attracting more male readers.\u201cI gave Town & Country some teeth, reporting on behavior that wasn\u2019t always that which, well, Emily Post would approve, like having an evening toke instead of a Scotch on the rocks,\u201d said Mr. Fielden, who still serves as that magazine\u2019s editorial director.While he aims to do the inverse at Esquire, and bring in more female readers, Mr. Fielden nevertheless has a legacy to protect at Esquire. Esquire, after all, has been the industry\u2019s most exclusive boys club for eight decades running.When Esquire debuted from its Chicago headquarters in 1933, it was a magazine with a mandate.Esquire provided anything but scraps. That first issue was like the publishing equivalent of \u201cMeet the Beatles,\u201d with Arnold Gingrich, the founding editor, serving up articles by a future Nobel Prize winner (Ernest Hemingway), a future poet laureate of the United States (Joseph Auslander) and a heavyweight champion (Gene Tunney), not to mention work by literary lions including Ring Lardner Jr., Dashiell Hammett and John Dos Passos.Through the Depression and the war years, the pages of Esquire were the place to be for the brightest and brawniest of American writers. Hemingway published his classic story \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro\u201d in the magazine in 1936. F. Scott Fitzgerald seemed to spend more time in Esquire than in the Commodore Hotel bar, publishing 43 stories in the magazine in just seven years before his death in 1940 at age 44.Observers might have expected this monument to bourbon-and-shotguns manhood to crumble when faced with the rise of feminism, flower power and civil rights in 1960s. Instead, Esquire entered a second golden age.The art director George Lois, known for his cover showing Andy Warhol being sucked into a can of Campbell\u2019s soup, turned the Esquire cover into a form of pop art: the boxer Sonny Liston as \u201cthe first black Santa Claus\u201d; the Italian actress Virna Lisi with a face full of shaving cream for a 1965 article on \u201cThe Masculinization of the American Woman.\u201dShowing off his instincts for journalistic anarchy, Mr. Hayes dispatched the literary pranksters Terry Southern, Jean Genet and William Burroughs into the tinderbox of the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Facing down the armies of the police in the riot-torn city, the kimono-clad Mr. Genet, a prostitute and thief turned novelist, concluded that America would be better off being \u201creduced to powder.\u201dLike that heady spirit of revolution, however, Esquire\u2019s zenith could not last. But as a result, for nearly 50 years, every new Esquire editor \u2014 there were six in the 1970s alone \u2014 assumed the job with an implicit mandate, to bring it back to its glory years.Industry skeptics reacted as if Tiger Beat had snapped up The New Yorker, but the new regime rode the \u201chip to be square\u201d 1980s, when classic Eisenhower-era suits, cocktails and social climbing roared back into fashion, to a striking turnaround, selling the magazine to Hearst in 1987.Sometimes it worked. Other times, attempts to channel the spirit of Mr. Hayes fell flat, such as when Norman Mailer, then 71, took on the Madonna phenomenon. Writing in the third person, Mr. Mailer caught up with the star after a draining photo shoot, writing, \u201cOf course her breasts would be the first part of her to express such physical discontent, even as any good fellow\u2019s penis would shrivel when low in spirit.\u201dBy 1996, The New York Times was observing Esquire\u2019s \u201cthinning spine and declining circulation.\u201d A year later, Hearst handed the reins to David Granger, GQ\u2019s celebrated executive editor.Even so, Mr. Granger settled into a 19-year-tenure \u2014 the longest in Esquire\u2019s history \u2014 in which the magazine enjoyed a financial recovery, and became the Meryl Streep of the National Magazine Awards (it won 17 during Mr. Granger\u2019s reign).On Jan. 29, 2016, David Carey, the Hearst president, strode into the Esquire offices with Mr. Fielden to introduce him as the new boss.To borrow Mr. Hayes\u2019s phrase, it was time to build some new myths.Mr. Fielden takes the helm at a time when men\u2019s magazines as a category seem to be having an identity crisis. Details has shuttered, Maxim has cycled through editors, and Playboy has done away with its raison d\u2019\u00eatre, naked women.It is easy to blame the internet, but to Mr. Fielden, that is a tired excuse.\u201cThere are a lot of false narratives out there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tell me about the last time you had an amazing experience on a website that you wanted to print and hang on your wall? If that\u2019s the Holy Grail, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve done with newspapers and magazines for our entire existence, and that\u2019s where this thing has to hit, because the human race is not getting stupider.\u201dEven so, Esquire is pouring new resources into the web. This past December, Esquire\u2019s 48-hour pop-up channel, \u201cThe Esquire Guide to Grooming\u201d on Snapchat\u2019s Discover platform, reached more than three million unique viewers. Hearst recently hired Steve Kandell, the former executive editor for features at BuzzFeed, to direct Esquire.com, a site that has received a traffic boost of 20 percent in the past six months.\u201cBad short pieces read long, and good long pieces read short,\u201d Mr. Fielden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think shrinking is necessarily bad. I\u2019m a great fan of the haiku.\u201dIf Mr. Fielden\u2019s only challenge were competing with the internet, that would at least be a familiar problem. More confounding is the rapidly changing cultural landscape.\u201cI understand what the hurdles are, what the difficulties are,\u201d Mr. Fielden said. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly things that keep me up, and sometimes ruin my weekend.\u201dBut, he added: \u201cI look back on what the New Journalism invented, what Gay did, what Tom Wolfe did, what Norman Mailer did. They had to up the literary horsepower with new tools and techniques in order to compete with the speed and seismic shock of one insane event after another in the \u201960s and \u201970s. We\u2019re just having to do the same thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Self-Driving Car Unit Accuses Uber of Using Stolen Technology", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google\u2019s parent company, claimed in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that Uber was using intellectual property stolen by one of Google\u2019s former project leaders.In a federal court filing in San Francisco, Waymo said Anthony Levandowski, who runs Uber\u2019s autonomous car division, downloaded 14,000 files from Google a month before leaving to start his own self-driving car company, Otto. Uber acquired Otto in August for $680 million, about seven months after Mr. Levandowski left Google.\u201cOtto and Uber have taken Waymo\u2019s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology,\u201d the company said in the filing. \u201cUltimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymo\u2019s expense.\u201dUber did not respond to requests for comment.In its filing, Waymo said it was inadvertently copied on an email from one of its suppliers with drawings of Uber\u2019s circuit board design for its lidar technology, short for light detection and ranging, \u201d that are laser-based sensors used in self-driving cars. Waymo said Uber\u2019s design bore \u201ca striking resemblance\u201d to its proprietary and highly secret design and infringed on Waymo\u2019s patents.Waymo also said that a number of Google employees, who subsequently left to join Mr. Levandowski at Otto, downloaded additional trade secrets before departing. These included supplier lists, manufacturing details and technical information, Waymo said.The suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology.Otto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort.He is a prominent figure in the world of self-driving vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a self-driving motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagon\u2019s first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on self-driving cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up, 510 Systems.Companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on self-driving car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits.The self-driving car company spun out from Google accused the ride-hailing service of advancing its own autonomous vehicle push by using intellectual property stolen by one of Google\u2019s former project leaders.In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the company\u2019s Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new self-driving car company. Tesla\u2019s suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information.Alphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its self-driving technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber.For Uber, Otto represents a significant bet on the future of transportation. Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Uber\u2019s self-driving technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the company\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the company\u2019s testing and self-driving efforts.Uber has also struck a deal with Volvo to jointly develop a self-driving vehicle, the XC-90; early versions of it have been released in some cities.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Uber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet.Mr. Holder and Tammy Albarran, a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling who is working on the investigation, said the inquiry would be \u201cthorough, impartial and objective.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Facebook Owes to Journalism", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorUnfortunately, his memo ignored two major points \u2014 the role that Facebook and other technology platforms are playing in inadvertently damaging local news media, and the one way they could actually save journalism: with a massive philanthropic commitment.Local news is weak in large part because the business models have collapsed. The main reason: As advertising spending shifted from print, TV and radio to the internet, the money didn\u2019t mostly go to digital news organizations. Increasingly, it goes to Facebook and Google.To be clear, Facebook and Google are not being malicious. This isn\u2019t like the tobacco industry knowingly trying to addict people to a product that kills them. Quite the contrary; these companies are sucking in the lion\u2019s share of digital advertising because the ad products they offer are so damn good. They are saving local businesses massive amounts of money.But just because the result is unintentional doesn\u2019t mean it is fantasy: Newsrooms have been decimated, with basic accountability reporting slashed as a result.A quick word about two other big players, Verizon and Apple. If Verizon, which owns AOL, succeeds in buying Yahoo, the combined company would become the third biggest recipient of digital advertising dollars, earning about 10 percent.I\u2019m not saying that the good stuff \u2014 the mobile revolution, blocking intrusive ads, better marketing options for small businesses \u2014 doesn\u2019t outweigh the bad. And local news organizations absolutely contributed to the problem with their sluggish and often uncreative reaction to the digital revolution. But we still need to accept that \u201cdisruption\u201d does disrupt, and occasionally some of what gets overturned is extremely important. When that happens \u2014 and if adequate market-based solutions haven\u2019t materialized \u2014 philanthropy must step in, too.In the last ten years or so, there has been a bit of an increase in philanthropic support for journalism. But if you look closely, a few things stand out.The next thing you notice is the four names that are missing from the list of 89 foundations that contributed during those two years: the foundations connected to Facebook, Google, Verizon and Apple. The Tulsa Community Foundation donated more to help investigative journalism than those four combined.If we go back further in time, the pattern persists: $145 million was donated for investigative journalism by 374 foundations from 2009 to 2016. There was one from the big four \u2014 $10,000 in 2011 to the Bronx News Network.As a reminder, these companies have not exactly been financially struggling. In 2016, the four posted a combined net income of $88 billion ($19.4 for Google, $10.2 for Facebook, $13 billion for Verizon and $45 billion for Apple). By contrast, the combined net income for The New York Times, Gannett and McClatchy was $41 million.But while training, technology and innovation are critical, what journalism needs most now is money, and lots of it \u2014 to fund full-time local journalists. What these companies have donated so far is too little given how wealthy they are, how much harm they\u2019re (inadvertently) doing \u2014 and how much good they could do.If the leaders of these companies put the equivalent of just 1 percent of their profits, for five years, to the cause, local American journalism would be transformed for the next century.There\u2019s no doubt that the digital revolution \u2014 built in no small part by these four companies \u2014 has made reporting much easier for the journalists still remaining in local newsrooms. But we urgently need far more of those journalists.These companies are among the biggest beneficiaries of the digital disruption that has, among other things, caused the crisis in American journalism. It\u2019s time for the disrupters to solve these problems. They have the money, the know-how and the obligation.An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a Google co-founder.

{"Headline": "600 Miles in a Coffin-Shaped Bus, Campaigning Against Death Itself", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "FeatureZoltan Istvan ran for president with a modest goal in mind: human immortality.Supported byThis man\u2019s name was Zoltan Istvan, and I had known him for about a year and a half by the time he began his progress across the country, from the Bay Area, where he lived, to Florida, and thence northward to Washington, where he planned to ascend Capitol Hill and, in coy allusion to Martin Luther\u2019s delivery of his 95 Theses, affix a Transhumanist Bill of Rights to the great ornate bronze door of the Rotunda.For transhumanists, this could only be conceived of as a rhetorical question, the obvious answer to which was a resounding yes. I had spent the previous 18 months immersed in this diffuse and heterogeneous movement, through which I encountered many forms of radical optimism about the potential for technology to transform the human condition, to improve our bodies and minds to the point that we become something better \u2014 something other than the animals we are. I met scientists who were convinced of the possibility and necessity of converting our minds into code, of uploading them into machines. I visited a cryonics facility outside Phoenix, in which the severed heads of the faithful were stored in liquid nitrogen, in the hope that future scientific innovations would permit their eventual return to life. I spent several nights in a basement in Pittsburgh with a group of self-proclaimed cyborgs who designed and built human-enhancement technologies for subdermal implantation. And I met a great many believers in what is known as \u201cthe technological Singularity,\u201d a messianic prophesy of our coming merger with machines, most famously advanced by Ray Kurzweil, a director of engineering at Google.I first met Istvan at a transhumanist conference in Piedmont, Calif., in the spring of 2014. He was handsome in an irrefutable and yet somehow unserious fashion, like a life-size Ken doll or a proof-of-concept for an Aryan eugenic ideal. I recognized right away that he was not a typical transhumanist. He was polite and charismatic and in no obvious sense geeky or awkward. He gave me a copy of a book he recently self-published called \u201cThe Transhumanist Wager,\u201d an unwieldy novel of ideas about a freelance philosopher named Jethro Knights who sails around the world to promote the need for life-extension research and winds up establishing a floating libertarian city-state called Transhumania \u2014 a regulation-free utopia of tech billionaires and rationalists \u2014 from which he wages an atheist holy war on a theocratic United States.A couple of days later, at a cafe in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, he told me of how the novel did not go over well with any of the 656 agents and publishers he sent it to over the previous year. He had spent over a thousand dollars, he said, on postage alone. The book\u2019s cover, which he designed himself, featured a greenish negative image of his own face, in profile, staring into the vacant sockets of a human skull.\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be like \u2018Hamlet,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, with the whole Yorick scene? With me facing the prospect of death and all that? But yeah, I\u2019m not sure it really works.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen worse book covers,\u201d I said, which for all I knew might have been the truth.He confided that his wife, Lisa, a gynecologist who worked for Planned Parenthood, recently started to express a keen interest in his doing something productive with his life. Lisa had just given birth to their second child and, what with the exponentially growing cost of living in the Bay Area, she was becoming increasingly concerned about the need to begin saving for their two daughters\u2019 educations. He explained to me that he was reluctant to fritter away money on such things, given that by the time the girls were in their late teens, it would be possible to upload the informational content of a Harvard or Yale degree directly to their brains and at a fraction of what such an education costs today.Lisa, he said, was largely tolerant of his views, but drew the line at gambling their children\u2019s futures on the fanciful notion of some imminent technological intervention.\u201cObviously she\u2019s a little resistant to transhumanist ideas,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause in the near future her entire profession will be obsolete. What with actual childbirth becoming a thing of the past. You know, with babies being produced by ectogenesis and whatnot.\u201dWhen, some months later, Istvan emailed me about his decision to run for president, I immediately called him. The first thing I asked was what his wife thought of the plan.\u201cWell, in a way,\u201d he said, \u201cit was Lisa who gave me the idea. Remember how I said she wanted me to do something concrete, get some kind of a proper job?\u201d\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m guessing running for president on the immortality platform was not what she had in mind.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cIt took a little while for her to come around to the idea.\u201d\u201cHow did you break it to her?\u201d\u201cI left a note on the refrigerator,\u201d he said, \u201cand went out for a couple hours.\u201d\u201cRoen Horn,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to live forever?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure that I do,\u201d I said, feeling the slender bones of his hand as I received it in my own.\u201cWell, why not?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to die? Do you think death is a good thing?\u201d\u201cThese are tricky questions,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I think about them on the bus and get back to you?\u201dThis Roen Horn, I learned as we walked down the eerily deserted main street, was a volunteer for Istvan\u2019s campaign, a zealous advocate of radical life extension who was also making a documentary about the Immortality Bus. The vehicle in question was, at the moment, moored in the parking lot of a nearby Bank of America. The immediate plan, Istvan told me, was to drive out into the desert to the White Sands Missile Range, where he intended to stage a protest highlighting the need to divert public money away from weapons spending and into life extension.The Wanderlodge was an even odder spectacle than I had anticipated: a great brown absurdity with the words IMMORTALITY BUS WITH TRANSHUMANIST ZOLTAN ISTVAN neatly hand-painted in white across the length of its midsection. On the rear of the bus were painted the words SCIENCE VS. THE COFFIN. A construction of inward-slanting wooden boards, also brown, was affixed to the roof, on top of which rested an elaborate arrangement of synthetic flowers. The effect of all this was not uncoffin-like, but it helped if you already knew what you were supposed to be looking at.Within were all the trappings and creature comforts of a midrange 1970s bachelor pad: a kitchenette equipped with ice machine and microwave oven, a dining table, ample bench-style seating for on-road lounging and, toward the rear, two narrow bunks and a bathroom (nonfunctional). Orange shag carpeting featured throughout.The thing was road-worthy, more or less, as long as you didn\u2019t drive it uphill at too steep a gradient and as long as you pulled over every 90 minutes or so to refill the motor oil, which leaked out the side at a truly alarming rate. This steady leakage was a concern for Istvan, not just with respect to the long-term health prospects of the Immortality Bus but more urgently the likelihood of our getting pulled over on the freeway by a traffic cop \u2014 something that, given the conspicuousness of the vehicle, seemed a nontrivial prospect.The difficulties began about half an hour outside Las Cruces. As the freeway slung a wide loop around the jagged foothills of the Organ Mountains, the sound of the engine, striving to haul us uphill, had become a shrill rasp. We were maxing out at about 35 m.p.h., and Istvan\u2019s hulking form was bent low over the wheel, as he eyed the dashboard\u2019s archaic array of mysterious dials.\u201cWe look to be overheating pretty bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this far into the red. And this isn\u2019t even a particularly big hill. We could have a problem here, gentlemen.\u201dUpward trajectories were best avoided, he explained, on account of a cruel paradox at work in the ancient mechanics of the Wanderlodge: The longer you went uphill, the harder the engine had to strain to move the bus at even a sluggish pace; and the slower you went, the less air circulated from outside to cool the engine, thereby perpetuating the cycle of overheating.We crested the hill and began to pick up speed on the downward slope. The engine\u2019s whining descended somewhat in pitch, and I was newly confident that we were no longer about to grind to a halt in the desolate heat of the desert.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d I said.\u201cActually,\u201d Istvan said in a cheerful tone, \u201cit\u2019s far more dangerous coming downhill, because we\u2019re relying on 40-year-old brake pads here.\u201dAlthough I was not sure I wanted to live forever, I was sure that I didn\u2019t want to go down in a blaze of chintzy irony, plunging into a ravine strapped into the passenger seat of a thing called the Immortality Bus. For all that Istvan railed against the tyranny of death over human lives, his attitude toward basic road safety was at times wildly cavalier. The fact that he was piloting a 38-foot coffin bus through New Mexico did not, for instance, stop him from looking at his phone every couple of minutes, responding to texts and emails, checking the social-media analytics on his latest piece for TechCrunch, etc.Between the driver and passenger seats there was a large, raised, shag-pile-carpeted area, which I was using to lay out my various writerly impedimenta: voice recorder, notebook, pens and so forth. This, it turned out, housed the Wanderlodge\u2019s engine. At one point, Istvan decided that it might ameliorate the overheating issues if he opened this up to \u201clet the engine breathe.\u201d As soon as we lifted the lid of this housing, the whole interior was quickly transformed into a hellish, hurtling sauna, heated by the searing petroleum fumes that emanated from the roaring shag-pile maw of the open engine unit.\u201cI know it\u2019s not pleasant!\u201d bellowed Istvan over the near-deafening roar of the engine, \u201cbut it\u2019s really helping with the overheating!\u201dAt length we pulled over to let the engine cool awhile, and Istvan went outside to change the oil. Horn was recumbent on the long couch to the rear of the driver\u2019s seat, staring impassively at the ceiling, his hands cradling the back of his head. This was to become his default attitude throughout the trip.I craned around in my seat and asked him how he wound up volunteering for Istvan\u2019s campaign.\u201cI just really don\u2019t want to die,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that would suck more than being dead. So I\u2019m just doing what I can to ensure that life-extension science gets the funding it needs.\u201d\u201cSo what is it you do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI mean workwise. When you\u2019re not volunteering for Zoltan.\u201d\u201cI run the Eternal Life Fan Club,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an online organization for people who are serious about living forever. Not, like, 500 years like a lot of transhumanists. Forever.\u201dHorn was 28, he said, and lived in Sacramento with his father, a recently retired insurance-claims adjuster, and his mother, who worked in a movie theater. His parents were Christians, his father a Calvinist who believed in eternal life in paradise for the elect and in eternal damnation for the unchosen. He was especially vocal in his conviction that his atheist son was destined for the infernal torments of hell.\u201cHow does he feel about this whole Immortality Bus thing?\u201d I asked.\u201cHe\u2019s actually O.K. with it,\u201d Horn said. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s cool I\u2019m getting to be on TV news and all.\u201dJust past the security checkpoint at the entrance to the facility, there was a kind of open-air munitions exhibit that featured a squat replica of the Fat Man, along with dozens of other decommissioned rockets and bombs. In the undulating heat of the desert, these slender tilted obelisks loomed like the inscrutable monuments of an ancient thanatopia, a henge of metal phalluses thrusting skyward in ecstatic communion with the cosmic powers. Istvan removed from his backpack a banner he had printed for the occasion and, positioning himself in front of one of the larger rockets, instructed Horn to take a series of photographs of him bearing the rolled-out message: TRANSHUMANIST PARTY PREVENTS EXISTENTIAL RISK. The intention of the protest, if you could really call it that, was to create a series of images and short videos to be uploaded to Istvan\u2019s various social-media accounts and shared among his many thousands of followers. Leaning self-consciously against the Fat Man replica, I scribbled in my notepad. Horn took out his phone and filmed a six-second Vine video of Istvan saying: \u201cStop nuclear war! It\u2019s a devastating existential risk!\u201d Then he filmed Istvan giving another brief speech on the central theme of his campaign: the need to divert government spending away from war and into research on life extension.Later that evening, we pulled off the Interstate and checked into a motel. As I stood in the doorway, waiting for Istvan and Horn to get their stuff from the Wanderlodge, I browsed through a stand of leaflets by the entrance. Most of these advertised sites of general touristic interest \u2014 for instance, PistachioLand, \u201chome of the world\u2019s largest pistachio\u201d \u2014 but there was also a small assortment of Christian pamphlets, and of these I selected one that was simply titled \u201cEternity.\u201d It was a prospectus of the apocalypse, published by an outfit called the Gospel Tract and Bible Society. Standing in the empty lobby of the motel, I read of God\u2019s decree that all things shall cease to exist \u2014 that \u201cthe heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up\u201d \u2014 and I thought again of the unearthly monument I had walked around that day, the ceremonial circle with its ranged machineries of death.Reading on, I learned how I, or my soul, might survive the death of my body and all other worldly things by surrendering myself to the Lord. I remembered asking Horn, earlier that day, about how his religious upbringing might have informed his belief that he would live forever through science. He said there was no longer any need for gods.\u201cScience is the new God,\u201d he said. \u201cScience is the new hope.\u201dHorn, with his Calvinist background, seemed to me now a walking illustration of the way in which scientific progress had displaced divine providence as our culture\u2019s locus of faith. He embodied, in fact, the religious dimension of transhumanism: a movement that, in its grand mythos of the coming Singularity, maintains a Christian distaste for the flesh and its frailties. Its delirious eschatology foretells a final unity with the technological divine, through which the elect will make the transition from time into eternity.Istvan, by contrast, had come to transhumanism from a more secular, hedonic background. In his 20s, having graduated from Columbia University with a degree in philosophy and religion, he fixed up an old yacht and set out to circumnavigate the globe. He funded his trip partly by making short documentaries for the National Geographic Channel about the remote places he was visiting. Somewhere along the way, he invented an extreme sport called volcano boarding (basically snowboarding, except you do it on the slopes of an active volcano). While reporting on the large number of buried land mines still remaining in Vietnam\u2019s former DMZ, Istvan himself came very close to stepping on one; his guide tackled him from behind as he was walking and brought him to the ground just inches from where an unexploded mine was jutting from the earth.In the narrative he had constructed about his life, this was the moment he became a transhumanist \u2014 the moment he became consumed by an obsession with mortality, with the unacceptable fragility of human existence. He returned to California to set up a real estate business and, taking full advantage of the permissive finance culture of those years, bought and flipped a number of properties in quick succession. He hated the work, but he was good at it and made quite a lot of money very quickly. Right before the crash in 2008, he sold half his portfolio and came out of the deal a millionaire. Forty years after his own parents fled communist Hungary, he had become the embodiment of an American capitalist ideal: the immigrant son with a weird European name who became an honest-to-God self-made millionaire. It hadn\u2019t even been that hard. The money was enough to enable him to quit his job and to dedicate himself to the possibility, and the necessity, of achieving immortality through science.He was a transhumanist ascetic, a young man who had largely withdrawn from the world so that he might never have to leave it. He had placed his faith in the idea of \u201clongevity escape velocity,\u201d the popular transhumanist notion that the pace of advancement in the science of life extension would eventually accelerate to the point that, for every year that passes, average human-life expectancy increases by more than a year. Horn told me that, in his parents\u2019 house in Sacramento, he slept on the floor of his bedroom, partly because he didn\u2019t want to buy a bed when what little money he had might better be spent on supporting life-extension research, but mainly because of a distaste for soft surfaces. (This self-avowed aversion was roundly contradicted by his near-fanatical dedication to couch-based recumbence, as outlined above.)\u201cI have to admit,\u201d I said, \u201cI find this whole immortality thing difficult to get behind. Doesn\u2019t your obsession with living eternally actually amount to your being totally imprisoned by death?\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut aren\u2019t we all? Isn\u2019t that kind of the whole idea?\u201d I told him that I took his point, and we both laughed, a little awkwardly perhaps, and ate our lunches in silence for a while, listening in on Istvan\u2019s terse exchange with his wife.It was late October, and the truck stop was lavishly bedecked with the ghoulish paraphernalia of the season \u2014 plastic jack-o\u2019-lanterns, cotton spider webs, wall-mounted witches on broomsticks and other festive gewgaws. Dangling from the ceiling directly behind Horn\u2019s head was a rubber statuette of Death itself, the skeletal form shrouded in a ragged black cowl, a plastic scythe clutched in its bony little hand. This cartoonish figurine twirled slowly on its nylon string, distracting me with its overblown enactment of bargain-basement foreshadowing.\u201cI just want to have fun forever,\u201d Horn said at length, guiding a forkful of dry salad leaves toward his pale face. \u201cThe 20 years I get from eating the way I do could be the difference between my dying and my getting to longevity escape velocity. I\u2019m holding off on pleasure now so that I can have more pleasure later. I\u2019m actually a total hedonist.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem even slightly like a hedonist to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t drink, you don\u2019t take drugs. You barely eat. To be honest, you seem like a medieval monk.\u201dHorn cocked his head to one side, gave the idea some consideration. I didn\u2019t want to raise the topic of sex, but it seemed to hang there, twirling slowly above our heads like the rubber avatar of Death. I didn\u2019t have to, as it turned out: Horn brought it up himself.\u201cYou know one really cool thing about being alive in the future?\u201d he asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cSexbots.\u201d\u201cSexbots.\u201d\u201cYou know, like A.I. robots that are built for having sex with.\u201d\u201cOh, sure,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of sexbots. It\u2019s a nice-enough idea. You really think that\u2019s going to happen, though?\u201d\u201cFor sure,\u201d Horn said, closing his eyes and nodding beatifically, in momentary reflection upon some distant exaltation. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m very much looking forward to.\u201dHe had a particular way of smiling that was half evasion and half challenge. Out of context, you might be tempted to describe it as smug, but the effect was somehow deeply endearing.\u201cThe problem I have with sexbots,\u201d I said, \u201cis why wouldn\u2019t you just have sex with an actual person? I mean, all things being equal.\u201dHe said: \u201cAre you kidding me? A real girl could cheat on you, sleep around. You could get an S.T.D. You could maybe even die.\u201d\u201cIs that potentially a bit alarmist?\u201d\u201cNo way, man. It happens literally all the time. See, a personal sexbot would never cheat on you, and it would be just like a real girl.\u201dHe said nothing for a time and drank at leisure from his glass of water. He consumed some further forkfuls of salad. He gazed out the window at the parking lot full of trucks, the Interstate beyond, the ever-present vultures hanging in the air.I said, \u201cDo you mind me asking if you\u2019ve had bad experiences with people cheating on you?\u201d\u201cI have so far abstained from sex,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never had a girlfriend.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saving yourself for the sexbots?\u201dHe nodded slowly, shrewdly raising his eyebrows. You bet he was saving himself for the sexbots.\u201cFair enough,\u201d I said, raising my hands in capitulation. \u201cI hope you live that long.\u201dHe said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I will.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m good at, half-assing stuff,\u201d he told me one afternoon in the parking lot of a Walmart where we stopped to fill a cart with containers of motor oil and some barbecue trays to collect it as it leaked from the bus.I said I\u2019d begun to think of the Immortality Bus as the Entropy Bus, the three of us trundling across Texas in a great mobile metaphor for the inevitable decline of all things, the disintegration of all systems over time.\u201cEntropy sucks,\u201d Horn said.\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Istvan said. \u201cIt absolutely is what it is.\u201dThe question of futility, given the inexorable suckiness of entropy, was raised many times on the Wanderlodge. Istvan and Horn believed that life was rendered meaningless by death. If in the end everything was lost, they asked, what was the point of anything?I did not feel qualified to answer this question, but I tried to make a case for life as it currently stood, which meant trying to make a case for death. Wasn\u2019t it the fact that life ended, I asked, that gave it what meaning it had? Wasn\u2019t it the very fact that we were here for so brief a time, that we could be gone at any moment, that made life so intensely beautiful and terrifying and strange? (Then again, wasn\u2019t the idea of meaning itself an illusion, a necessary human fiction? If a finite existence was futile, wouldn\u2019t immortality be just a state of endless futility?)There was no beauty in finitude, they replied, no meaning to be extracted from oblivion. My arguments, Horn insisted, were transparently motivated by a \u201cdeathist\u201d ideology, a need to protect myself against the terror of death by trying to convince myself that death was actually not so terrible. As crazy as most of what Horn said sounded to me, he was, I thought, basically right about this.We drove through the emptiness. Now and then we passed a hand-painted sign standing in a field, a gesture of anonymous pride or defiance. A \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d A \u201cDeport Obama.\u201d A \u201cDon\u2019t Mess With Texas.\u201d Mostly, we passed roadkill. For miles at a stretch, the only landmarks were corpses: foxes, raccoons, armadillos in various states of putrefaction on the margins of the Interstate. Istvan swigged at intervals from a magnum-size vessel of greenish energy drink he picked up on our last Walmart stop. We talked for hours and then for hours more we said nothing at all. We listened to a Tom Petty greatest-hits cassette straight through, twice, three times. \u201cRunnin\u2019 down a dream,\u201d Petty sang, \u201cthat never would come to me.\u201d An hour later, he sang it again.About an hour east of Ozona, we pulled off the Interstate onto a narrow side road so that Istvan could remove the barbecue tray, which was by now almost overflowing with leaked oil. We were on the perimeter of a vast ranch, a flat and half-barren landscape of scrub grass and squat cactuses as far as the human eye could see. I went behind the bus to urinate, and as I did so I looked up and counted five vultures idling overhead, like predator drones in the inverted abyss of the sky. I tried to imagine how we might have appeared to the serene eyes of these primordial beasts, three medium-size mammals lumbering upright, without apparent purpose, around a great coffin-shaped leviathan. But what could any of this \u2014 men, coffins, journeys \u2014 possibly mean to these creatures, to whom nothing was required to mean anything? Being not yet dead, we were probably irrelevant to their view of the landscape.I struggled to remember some lines from the eighth of Rilke\u2019s Duino Elegies, in which he writes about the freedom in which animals live: \u201cthe Open\u201d upon which they look out but which is unavailable to our sight, oriented as we are always toward the overbearing presence of our own finitude. Back on the bus, I searched for the passage on my phone and found it: \u201cWe, only, can see death; the free animal/has its decline in back of it, forever,/and God in front, and when it moves, it moves/already in eternity, like a fountain.\u201dLater, as we barreled along the Interstate, Horn cheerfully drew our attention toward a gigantic billboard that read, \u201cIf you die today, where will you spend eternity?\u201d\u201cIn the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the ground.\u201dHe told me about an accident he had when he was 9. He fell from his bike, punctured his spleen and very nearly died from internal bleeding. There were weeks in the hospital, then a recovery; but a darkness was revealed to him, a black terror beneath the thin surface of the world. Every night, he awoke gasping from the same nightmare, in which he had died in his sleep, in which he felt himself lying there in his bed feeling nothing, an impossible body. Every night this same experience of a thing that could not be experienced, this same vision of a thing that could never be glimpsed. This was the beginning of his move away from the religion of his parents, he said, this vision of the nothingness that awaited him after death.We were standing on a lavishly tree-lined street in an upscale residential neighborhood in Austin where a campaign event was about to take place, and Istvan was being interviewed for local TV news. He was dressed in a shirt and slacks, his hair combed meticulously back from his high-domed forehead.\u201cI would agree that we are, in fact, trying to play God,\u201d he said.It was to me that he said this, or at any rate it was me he was looking at when he said it. The bearded and lavishly perspiring cameraman, who was double-jobbing as a reporter, had requested that I stand to one side of him as filmed; Istvan would, in this way, appear to be addressing a dedicated news reporter, rather than a guy who, presumably because of budget cuts, had been forced to do two jobs simultaneously.This was a thing that had been happening to me lately. I had started to see myself as a mechanism through which signals were passed. I would be sitting on the bus, jotting down snatches of conversation in my notebook, details of scenery or sensation, and I would see myself as a primitive device, a machine for the recording and processing of information. I would be at the checkout in a cavernous Walmart, paying for snacks, and I would see myself as one of many millions of mechanisms in a vast and mysterious system for the upward transfer of wealth. I knew, of course, that this was a result of my overexposure to mechanistic ideas, but on some level I recognized that I had always seen myself in this way.\u201cAnd what made you decide to run for president?\u201d asked the cameraman who was also a reporter.\u201cI believe,\u201d Istvan said, \u201cthat we should take technology as far as it can take us.\u201d His hand gestures had the practiced decisiveness of a real-deal politician; in the presence of the camera, as he gazed unblinkingly into my eyes, he had taken on a plausibly presidential aura. He seemed, suddenly, a vast physical presence, a great hollow monument to his own significance.\u201cAnd that includes,\u201d he said, \u201cbecoming technology ourselves. At some point, we are going to become more machines than human beings. That\u2019s what my presidential campaign is advocating for. That\u2019s the conversation I\u2019m trying to start.\u201dA cluster of young men approached us. They were part of an Austin biohacker group, and they were here for the campaign event. They had names like Alec, Avery and Shawn; they were, for transhumanists, a startlingly frat-brovian contingent, all laid-back Texan vibes, loosefitting vests, hypertrophied upper bodies.Horn received them in his usual manner, avoiding traditional greetings in favor of an immediate interrogation as to their stance on eternal life.\u201cI\u2019m down,\u201d said a guy named Alec, as though Horn had just asked him if he wanted to go in on a bag of weed. \u201cLet\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s make it happen. Life is awesome.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d Horn said. He glanced meaningfully at me, a look that I took as mild admonishment for previous exchanges in which I expressed reservations about absolute judgments on the awesomeness of life.We went into the house where the event was to take place, a small split-level open-plan that was almost entirely devoid of furniture. I was given to understand that the place was shared by a loose cohort of biohackers; it was not apparent who did and did not live there, but it seemed to be a kind of transhumanist commune or futurist frat house. Even for an event of this sort, the gathering was overwhelmingly male.We mingled for a while, and I drank some surprisingly potent home-brewed ale, and then Istvan delivered a fluent and apparently unscripted speech. History was being created, he said, with this movement, this campaign, which was not about getting votes but about raising awareness of the coming Singularity and the importance of living long enough to experience it.We hung around for an hour or so afterward, and at some point, Horn gave an impromptu speech of his own. He delivered this oration \u201cin character\u201d as a generic hipster, wearing a pair of black-framed glasses and a slightly strained knowing smirk on his face. This was a role he\u2019d been tinkering with in the videos he uploaded to the Eternal Life Fan Club\u2019s website over the course of the campaign.\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t mainstream,\u201d he said to the assembled biohackers, most of whom seemed mildly perplexed by the performance. \u201cYou still have your childlike imaginations. If you want to take your nonmainstreamness to the next level, you\u2019re gonna have to live forever. You know what the most mainstream thing ever is? Dying. Dying is totally mainstream. Being dead in the ground is totally mainstream. Vote for Zoltan if you want to live forever!\u201dI\u2019d seen this performance of Horn\u2019s before and had advised him that it was a little too broad in its depiction of the hipster trope, that it seemed like more of a caricature of a caricature than a representation of any actual person, and that, furthermore, the injection of performative irony into his delivery tended to obscure the absolute earnestness of his message. But right now, perhaps because of the unusually strong home-brew beer I was drinking, I was enjoying it immensely, and I felt a strange tenderness for him swelling in my chest, an almost fraternal instinct of protection, very much at odds with any properly journalistic imperatives.I agreed with practically nothing that came out of his mouth the entire time we spent together. He was as strange a person as I had ever met, and I had met a great many strange people in the year and a half I spent reporting on transhumanists. I found myself hoping that he would not be disillusioned, that he would maintain, as long as he lived, the sense of his own exemption from death. His very belief that existence was rendered meaningless by death was, I thought, precisely what seemed to afford his life a sense of purpose, a sense of direction. This, in the end, was why humans would always look for meaning and would always find it in some variety of religion. You do what you can with the strangeness of being here, for the time being.An hour or so later, we were in the backyard of an empty house on the far outskirts of the city, waiting for a cab to come and take us to our respective hotels. Istvan and I were downing the last of the Immortality Bus\u2019s booze stash. I was feeling a little lightheaded from the drinking, and from the small amount of weed I smoked at the party before remembering I hated smoking weed, and so I climbed down into the yard to take the air. The night was warm and fragrant and alive with the gentle chirping of crickets. I stared up at the stars, feeling pleasantly out of it. It was good to be outside, to be in the world, to be a living animal.The more I listened, the more urgent the chirping of the crickets seemed to become. I remembered then having read something in the news a couple of weeks earlier about a cricket infestation that had been particularly intense in the area around Austin. The swelling of the insects\u2019 numbers had to do with the summer\u2019s having been unusually wet. Now in the autumn, the cooling of the air had forewarned them, on some primordial level, of their own impending death. The chirping I was listening to, I now realized, was the sound of thousands of male animals expressing their urge to reproduce, an instinct made acute by their own approaching demise. The sound seemed to be intensifying and to be coming at once from everywhere and nowhere, to be generated by the night itself.I heard the buzz of Istvan\u2019s phone from across the yard. Our cabdriver calling, probably. I breathed in deeply, assimilating the warm and complicated air, the fragrant night. In my tipsy state, it seemed outright implausible that all of this would one day be beyond my reach, that one day I would die and never again breathe this air or hear these sounds \u2014 crickets, traffic, words, vibrating phones: the interwoven signals of animals and machines \u2014 or feel the hopeful surge of alcohol in my blood, the world advancing its uncertain promise. It seemed ludicrous to think that this was it: just this once, and never again.I heard the hollow slam of the Immortality Bus\u2019s door, and Istvan calling my name. Our cab had pulled up at the curb. I took a last look at the looming apparition of the bus, the great brown sarcophagus of the American highway, and was momentarily taken by the facile charm of its standing as a metaphor for life itself: an incomprehensible and futile journey, in a vast coffin-shaped recreational vehicle, out of one nowhere into some other. I walked toward the street, toward Istvan and Horn, deciding to tell them about this life-as-coffin-bus idea, and to tell them that I was glad to have been on this journey for a while, whatever it meant or did not mean. But by the time I got to the car and slid in beside Horn, Istvan was already sitting up front, passionately laying out the coordinates of the posthuman future to our cabdriver, and the moment had passed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Old-Fashioned TV Still Drives the Music Industry", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor all the whirlwind technological changes and crumbling barriers to entry in the music industry, some things sure have stayed pretty old school.Within a week of each other this month, two of the record industry\u2019s biggest events of the year \u2014 the Super Bowl halftime show and the Grammy Awards \u2014 demonstrated the effect they can still have on an artist\u2019s commercial success even at time when the idea of traditional gatekeepers seems archaic.Here\u2019s what the numbers tell us about the importance of TV to music. (All figures are courtesy of Nielsen.)So it makes sense that at least a fraction of those people, even football fans, would be persuaded to seek out the music they heard, especially when it\u2019s as easy as reaching for the phone (probably already in hand) or laptop and firing up Spotify or Apple Music.Most notably, \u201cMillion Reasons,\u201d the one song from \u201cJoanne\u201d she sang at the Super Bowl, went from nowhere to No. 4 on the Hot 100 after having previously peaked at 52 last year. That took some savvy business maneuvering: In addition to an increase in streams, Gaga and her label, Interscope, dropped the price of the song on iTunes to 69 cents from the standard $1.29, and sold 149,000 downloads.Grammy performers and winners saw similar surges, though on a smaller scale.For instance, on the day before the awards show, the country singer Sturgill Simpson\u2019s song \u201cAll Around You\u201d sold just about 20 downloads total. On Grammys day, when he performed the song live on the show, he sold about 2,200 downloads. Bruno Mars, who nailed a performance of his new single \u201cThat\u2019s What I Like,\u201d had his track sales jump from 5,000 to 22,800. Other performers like Ed Sheeran, Lukas Graham, Maren Morris and Keith Urban saw bumps, too.None of this exactly translates to riches for the artist, who is probably making only a few cents per download and fractions of a cent for every stream. This is not a windfall.But screen time at the Grammys and Super Bowl works as a launching pad \u2014 free advertising, basically \u2014 for more lucrative parts of the music business, namely touring. While most artists have generally always made their money by playing live, it\u2019s become a much more crucial part of the business as physical sales, especially, have diminished (again, Adele excluded).What better time to sell concert tickets than immediately after a flashy mini-show?Even if these fleeting national TV appearances don\u2019t result in career-defining gains \u2014 new loyal fans, after all, are hard to quantify \u2014 there are long-term benefits in simply increasing name recognition. Just take a look at Mr. Simpson\u2019s Google Trends chart over the last year leading up to the Grammys:In these times of fragmented \u00e0 la carte media, there are only so many monoculture moments, so artists are clamoring to be a part of the few that do remain. Even beyond the Grammys and the Super Bowl, TV can play a crucial role in breaking new music, whether it\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d or \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Record labels and managers are still dying to get their emerging artists placed on these shows, where they reach a far different audience \u2014 generally older and thus more likely to actually buy music (or vote in the Grammys?) \u2014 than those more digital listeners who keep up with Spotify\u2019s trending playlists.Consider this: Of the six artists to win a televised Grammy category on Sunday \u2014 Adele, Beyonc\u00e9, Chance the Rapper, Maren Morris, Twenty One Pilots and David Bowie \u2014 four had performed on \u201cS.N.L.\u201d at least once since their album release. (Chance, the only independent artist on that list, played three times.) The other two were Mr. Bowie, who died two days after the release of \u201cBlackstar,\u201d and Beyonc\u00e9. She, of course, has already owned the Super Bowl twice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond \u2018Hidden Figures\u2019: Nurturing New Black and Latino Math Whizzes", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs there a 10-digit number where the first digit is equal to how many 0\u2019s are in the number, the second digit is equal to how many 1\u2019s are in the number, the third digit is equal to how many 2\u2019s are in the number, all the way up to the last digit, which is equal to how many 9\u2019s are in the number?Within the scrum was a trio of friends-in-formation: \u201cCan we work on this during Open Math Time?\u201d one asked. The second, wearing red-and-black glasses and dogged by the fear that he did not belong \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m really not that good at math,\u201d he had told me earlier \u2014 lingered at the snack cart. \u201cLeave some for the rest of us, J. J.,\u2019\u2019 demanded the third, gently elbowing him aside.To Mira Bernstein, a BEAM instructor and a leading figure in the extracurricular math ecosystem that incubates many of the nation\u2019s scientists and engineers, the scene was unremarkable, except for one striking feature: None of the children were wealthy, and few were white or Asian.Try your hand at five math problems given to students at BEAM. The questions require no knowledge beyond addition and multiplication \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re easy.The 76 students, drawn from New York City public schools with low-income populations, were embarking on a curriculum that they would have to continue on their own during the school year to be eligible to apply for a second, even more intense math summer program, BEAM 7. That application is due at the end of this month, and with it comes a verdict of sorts on their membership in a math-geek subculture where it can be astonishingly difficult to find others who look like them.\u201cThis is probably more math-y black and Hispanic kids than I\u2019ve seen in my whole career,\u201d said Dr. Bernstein, who received a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from Harvard in the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201dBEAM is short for Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, and this, the program\u2019s first year of BEAM 6, for students who had just completed the sixth grade, is what many within elite math circles see as the most promising effort yet to diversify their ranks. The four weeks, spent in a school near City Hall, would be intense: four hours of math a day taught by 10 experienced math teachers, several of them Ph.D.\u2019s. There would be no prepping for standardized tests or effort to cover school material at a faster pace. Instead, as in the elite summer programs that Mr. Zaharopol had himself attended, BEAM focused on the kind of creative problem-solving that mathematicians say lie at the heart of the discipline.And because one summer would not be anywhere near enough to equip the BEAM 6-ers with the same kind of math preparation as their more affluent peers, the real goal of the founders \u2014 a mix of hedge-fund millionaires and professional mathematicians \u2014 was to hook them enough to want to keep at it.A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who suspended his graduate studies in algebraic topology to launch BEAM, Mr. Zaharopol had some idea of what his students were up against.By age 12, many attendees of the highly selective programs on which BEAM was modeled had already won regional math contests and completed online math courses in subjects like number theory. Some had been introduced to advanced math in school honors programs or by math teams. Many were the children of scientists and engineers, or of well-off parents who turned to math as another way to give their children a competitive edge in the battle for admission to elite colleges.By contrast, BEAM students come from environments where \u201cmath is not in the air,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said.\u201cThey did a study that shows white kids have more chances,\u201d he said once, remembering a fragment of something he had been told. Then he shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really true.\u201dTracing Jonathan\u2019s path through the program and into the school year provides a glimpse of both how easy it might be to nurture a love of math, and how daunting. It is also a testament to the persuasive power of friendship, unfolding over several months in the context of prime numbers and polyhedron sculptures.Jonathan, who chose J. J. as his summer nickname, had done everything in his power to avoid attending BEAM, which is financed by individual donors and foundations, and is free to participants. Then 11, he was chosen by his school to take the program\u2019s admissions test, and hid the acceptance letter upon receiving it last spring at school.When his mother, Kiana Ashburn, 32, found the letter buried at the bottom of his backpack, she waved off his pleas to go to the karate camp she had signed him up for. \u201cYou need to get a good education so you can get a good job and have a good future,\u201d she told him that afternoon in their sparely furnished rowhouse in the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx.She often made Jonathan repeat what he was to do if he were ever stopped: \u201cJust do what he says, and like, don\u2019t try to resist,\u201d he recited.She thought of math as a field that \u201cusually Asians dominate,\u2019\u2019 she said. It would not protect him from police violence, she knew, or the other things she feared. Her brother had spent time in prison.\u201cBut it could act as a buffer,\u201d she remembers thinking.Omar Pineda Jr. was the counselor assigned to escort them, but it was Emyr Willis, 11, who broke the ice. \u201cHello,\u201d he greeted them with the formality they would come to see as his trademark. \u201cI am the both the emissary and ambassador from my school.\u201dThays Garcia, also 11, was the group\u2019s third member.\u201cI love math,\u201d she said, her face lighting up when asked why she had agreed to spend her summer doing math problems.Her stepfather, Kevin Rincon, who dropped her off each morning, said he had taught himself algebra while serving a prison sentence for a drug felony.As she breezed ahead several grade levels, her friends gave her a nickname that she proudly took on: \u201cCalculator.\u201dBut Khan, Mr. Rincon also knew, was designed to foster basic math literacy, not \u201cthe theoretic understanding of exactly what is going on,\u201d as he put it in his email to BEAM. \u201cI want new possibilities and worlds opened for her to see.\u201dJonathan did not know it, but he had placed comfortably in the top half of the students admitted to BEAM, who in turn had been drawn from the top quarter of the 400 nominated by schools or parents to take the admissions test. He had spotted patterns and tried solutions that others had not.He had also placed above grade level on New York\u2019s statewide math test, a distinction shared by only 21 percent of the city\u2019s sixth graders, and just 7 percent of sixth graders who are black.He and Thays and Emyr were exactly the kinds of promising students for which BEAM had been created.But it had not been easy to get it going. Some potential supporters objected to devoting resources to high-performing minority students rather than the much larger group performing below grade level.In interviews, directors of established elite math programs expressed dismay at the way their own enrollments reflect those patterns.Most are nonprofits with limited money, organized by trained mathematicians for the benefit of students whose passion for math often leaves them at the bottom of social hierarchies at school. Some offer scholarships, but most said it was often difficult to find qualified students from underrepresented groups.There are other reasons for career disparities beyond who goes to math camp, of course, like the expense of postsecondary education and an effectively segregated public school system that provides poorer-quality education to many minority students.But the math divide is growing as more white and Asian parents enroll their children, even when they don\u2019t show a knack for numbers, in online math classes and the weekly math circles that have sprouted on university campuses. And the lack of enrichment-math experiences for black and Latino students, mathematicians and educators say, makes it harder for even high achievers in good schools to compete for spots at the colleges that serve as a springboard for plum jobs in science and technology.BEAM was founded in 2011 with help from Sandor Lehoczky, a senior trader at Jane Street and a onetime math team champion, who is known for subjecting job applicants to math puzzles. The math whizzes he hires, he said, have been \u201cswimming in a culture of math\u2019\u2019 from an early age.But BEAM\u2019s selective camp for students from low-income backgrounds who had just completed seventh grade has had mixed results.\u201cAlthough our students make tremendous progress,\u201d Mr. Zaharopol wrote in a 2015 grant proposal, \u201cit is clear that many of them, even our highest achievers, are still well below their potential.\u201dBEAM 6, designed for students who have just completed sixth grade, he said, reflected what they had learned: \u201cWe need to start earlier and we need to keep them for longer,\u2019\u2019 he said.At BEAM, Jonathan turned the lights off when he walked in and out of classrooms. He sped from one end of the room to another on his rolling chair, popping in on fellow students who were supposed to be working. He seemed more focused on complaining about the lunch food than zeroing in on logic.\u201cMathematicians love the struggle,\u201d one of the teachers repeated as a kind of mantra when students complained. \u201cWhen you feel uncomfortable, you\u2019re learning.\u201dBut whether students like Jonathan were having trouble with the math, were unprepared or were simply not trying was a subject of debate.In their weekly faculty meetings, the teachers often marveled at their students\u2019 progress. \u201cI can\u2019t get them to stop doing math,\u201d said Giselle George, who teaches at a public middle school on the Lower East Side.But teaching advanced concepts to students who had not all had the chance to learn certain basic math skills, like the laws of exponents, proved more difficult than some had anticipated.\u201cI find they\u2019re not very good at self-advocating when they\u2019re lost or bored,\u201d said another teacher, Marcelle Good. \u201cI guess they\u2019re used to being lost or bored.\u201dDuring the program\u2019s second week, Jonathan was a focus for both their hopes and their frustrations.\u201cHow do you get kids who haven\u2019t had the exposure the tools to even realize that math is something they like?\u201d Dr. Bernstein lamented.\u201cI\u2019m open to suggestions for how to reach him,\u201d said another. \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty big distraction in my class.\u201dBeyond their views, though, there were signs that Jonathan was finding other ways to connect to math.A few days after the challenge problem was posted in the hallway, he was lingering by the snack cart again when Thays arrived.\u201cHey, Thays,\u201d he said, brightening slightly at the sight of his commuting partner.He had infuriated her that morning by snapping a close-up picture of her nostrils with his phone, but had quickly redeemed himself by directing her to the sole empty seat on the crowded train.He shrugged, looking sideways at her.\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said.By the second week of camp, Jonathan, Emyr and Thays knew the passcodes to one another\u2019s phones so they could trade games. Thays and Jonathan had a running Subway Surfers phone game competition; Emyr sought to inspire the others with his passion for Pokemon Go.But they didn\u2019t share everything. Thays did not divulge, for instance, that her biological father, whom she rarely saw, had canceled plans for a trip she was looking forward to later in the summer.His friends did not know that Jonathan\u2019s father was a subway train conductor whom he had last seen about a year ago, in a chance encounter at the 125th street subway station near his school.Emyr did not talk about the bullies who had tormented him in elementary school.Thays, whose parents and stepfather are Dominican, had been to a protest some months earlier with her stepfather. She had written a poem about it.Jonathan had a vivid memory of the video his mother had shown him earlier that month: \u201cThere was a kid in the back of the car,\u201d he said, referring to the death of Philando Castile.Trying to translate, I asked Emyr if he had heard of Black Lives Matter. Emyr\u2019s father is Jamaican, his mother Puerto Rican.\u201cNo,\u201d Emyr said. \u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201dJonathan, looking up from his phone, took the opportunity to fill him in.\u201cHow can you not know what Black Lives Matter is?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s about how black people are getting killed by cops and it needs to stop.\u201dSeeking to lighten the trip home that afternoon, Mr. Pineda asked what they recalled of their day.Thays volunteered the simple riddle Dr. Bernstein had asked in her \u201cCodes Codes Codes\u201d class: \u201cI\u2019m thinking of a number from zero to 15. You have to guess my number by asking me four yes or no questions.\u201dThen Thays added the problem\u2019s final complication: \u201cHow many questions does it take if I\u2019m allowed to lie once?\u201dAs they deduced the strategy, they were working up to a harder problem, related to Hamming codes, the error-correcting codes that underlie digital storage and communications.\u201cThere\u2019s also something called binary,\u201d Thays informed Jonathan and Emyr.The girls she had become friends with in that class had agreed that they were all going to BEAM 7, she volunteered. \u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to BEAM 7,\u201d Emyr said.\u201cJ. J.?\u201d she prodded. But he was peering into his phone.That Jonathan was one of just a few African-American boys at BEAM (some of the other black students were the children of African or Caribbean immigrants) could have been a fluke. Or it could have been a reflection of the unique forms of discrimination faced by young African-American males, even in elementary school.Whatever the reason, many of the college-age counselors working alongside the teachers at BEAM were paying special attention to Jonathan.One of them was Christian Henderson, an African-American accounting major at Siena College, in Loudonville, N.Y. \u201cIt\u2019s important to educate a kid like J. J. right now,\u201d he said, \u201cso they know in their head they\u2019re on the same level as any white or Asian or Hispanic kid, before they get a little older and they see other people may not think, you know, that\u2019s true.\u201dJonathan\u2019s subway counselor, Mr. Pineda, 22, who is part Honduran and part Dominican, told Jonathan how a professor at Amherst College had mentioned that summer math camp had paved the way for many of his wealthy white classmates, whereas he felt lost during his sophomore year in discrete mathematics.By most measures, he knew, he was a success story. He had just graduated with a degree in math and Japanese studies. But it still bothered him that his classmates, the \u201csummer math nerds,\u201d as he and a friend had taken to calling them, had zoomed ahead.\u201cYou should look at this, J. J.,\u201d Mr. Pineda said on the Thursday afternoon of BEAM\u2019s second week, leafing through his homework folder to a triangular numbers problem. \u201cI think you\u2019d like it.\u201dThe following morning, Thays collapsed in pain at the Columbus Circle subway station as they were waiting for the A train.Emyr paced. Jonathan patted her arm. Mr. Pineda debated what to do. Her stomach hurt, she said. He tried to reach her parents, then called 911.Another counselor met the boys to take them to camp while Mr. Pineda accompanied Thays to the emergency room.When she didn\u2019t come back the next day, or the next, Jonathan railed at Thays\u2019s invisible presence as he, Mr. Pineda and Emyr made the morning commute. \u201cThays! I know you\u2019re just at home watching TV!\u201dHe also found himself thinking about math on the subway, visualizing a problem with triangular numbers and sifting through their patterns.BEAM teachers had explained it as a combination of math and pocket change: A triangular number is the number of pennies required if you\u2019re trying to make a triangle.For instance, if you want your triangle to have 2 pennies to a side, you\u2019ll need 3 pennies total; if you want it to have 3 pennies to a side, you need 6 pennies; for a triangle of 4 pennies to a side, you need 10.So 3, 6, 10 (and so on) are called the triangular numbers, and Jonathan was in search of the 299th triangular number. With the help of Marquia Williams, a BEAM counselor who was majoring in math at the State University of New York at Oswego, he figured it out, rewarding her with a stifled grin.After nearly a week away, Thays returned \u2014 her collapse had been caused by an ulcer that required minor surgery \u2014 to find Jonathan actually sitting still. He even raised his hand once in a while to offer insights in the class they shared.At home on one of the final days, Jonathan\u2019s sister, Jasmine, sat on the steps of their house. She had been attending summer school to catch up in several classes.\u201cHow\u2019s that camp going?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you still behind in your math?\u201dHe was silent for a moment.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not at that camp because I\u2019m bad at math,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019m there because I\u2019m good at math.\u201dOn the last day of program, the BEAM students gathered in a room to receive a graduation certificate. As their names were called, the counselors cheered. An especially loud one erupted for Jonathan.They would also receive problem sets in the mail, he told them, and he hoped they would send them back. The application for BEAM 7 would come at the end of the year.Emyr was among many who sobbed as the assembly broke up.A few parents had taken up the invitation to attend, including Thays\u2019s stepfather, but he was under strict instructions to drive home on his own.\u201cShe wants to go home with her regular group,\u201d he said, shrugging.On the subway, Thays fished in her bag, pulling out a white envelope that she gave to Omar; then another that she gave to Emyr, marked with a drawing of his favorite Pokemon character.\u201cYou made a slight mistake with the Pikachu,\u201d he noted. \u201cTheir eyes are supposed to be black on white.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s my present?\u201d Jonathan demanded, as she chatted with Omar. \u201cCome on, Thays.\u201dThays let a few more stops go by before relenting. Jonathan tore open the envelope.\u201cOh special, special JJ,\u201d she had written. \u201cYou are so annoying and rude. You always would get me mad and never stopped bothering me. But you always made the train ride fun. You were such a good BEAM friend and I hope to see you in BEAM 7.\u201dJonathan paused for a moment before looking up.\u201cNow if you gave me a Nerf gun, it would be better for everyone,\u201d he said, and put his arm around her.The three exchanged phone numbers.A few weeks later, poring over the surveys the students filled out on the last day, Mr. Zaharopol and his staff could take some measure of satisfaction. \u201cI want to get a Ph.D. in math,\u201d one student had written. Neither of his parents had graduated from college. Jonathan, in his review, recommended to future students that they pack their own lunches. He also wrote: \u201cI learned math they don\u2019t teach me at school.\u201dThe teachers, though, wondered how much they\u2019d really been able to achieve.\u201cThey\u2019re extremely passionate, and quick to pick up things,\u201d Mr. Zaharopol said in late October, when the BEAM staff gathered for an assessment. \u201cBut how many will stick with it? And are we reaching them soon enough?\u201dAs police shootings of black men continued and Donald J. Trump moved into the White House, Jonathan\u2019s mother had started to question her belief in the power of math to provide her son with a buffer. \u201cIt\u2019s just shocking that his views are the views of a lot of Americans,\u201d she said of the new president.She had allowed Jonathan to take karate after school, and by the start of winter he had obtained his advanced white belt.Jonathan had not heard from Thays, and he was flagging in the online pre-algebra class for which he had dutifully signed up. Sometimes his internet service, always erratic, would disconnect during the lessons.\u201cI might not be able to do it for a few weeks,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have homework.\u201dBut Emyr noted that all three of their names were on the short list of students who had sent back at least two correct answers to one of the problem sets that BEAM sent home.And one evening, on the top bunk of the bed he shares with his brothers, Jonathan decided to try Thays again.\u201cHey,\u201d he typed into his phone.\u201cWho is this?\u201d came the reply.\u201cJonathan from BEAM,\u201d he replied.\u201cJ. J.??!!\u201dHer phone had been broken, she explained. She hadn\u2019t received his texts.They traded messages, until Jonathan\u2019s mother reminded him that his phone privileges had been suspended.\u201cI am grounded for a week, so this is the last time we will be talking for now,\u201d he typed quickly.When the BEAM 7 applications arrived earlier this month, Thays and Emyr set to work. No math problems this time, just questions, 11 of them. What did she want to achieve in the eighth grade? \u201cI want to get into Bronx Science!\u201d Thays wrote, a reference to one of the city\u2019s most selective public high schools. \u201cI mean who doesn\u2019t?\u201d Why did he want to go to BEAM 7? \u201cTo see my BEAM peers,\u201d wrote Emyr, in addition to \u201cchallenging my brain.\u201dJonathan let his application sit on the kitchen table for a week. He let a long snow day with no school pass without looking at it. If he didn\u2019t want to go, his mother had told him, she wouldn\u2019t force him. He could do karate instead. Last Sunday, he began filling in the blanks. What kind of math did he find interesting? However unwittingly, his answer reflected BEAM\u2019s key lesson: \u201cI find proportion problems interesting because I\u2019ll always be confused,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I figure out the answer anyways.\u201dOn Monday, at work, his mother put it in the mail.An earlier version of this article misidentified the academic affiliation of Prof. Danny Martin. He is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, not at the University of Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Profits? Nice, but for These Investors, Conscience Matters More", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSeth Holehouse, who owns an auction house in New York City, has focused his investments on renewable energy and recycled products. He has done so for the last five years \u2014 despite steadily losing money on the strategy.It is passion, not profit, that guides him. And he is not about to let up. Instead, he is prepared to keep losing money in the near term with the expectation of gains down the road.\u201cWe\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d he said. \u201cThis philosophy is how we\u2019d like to invest in 20 years.\u201dInvesting with a guiding passion isn\u2019t the same as being an impact investor, who aims to effect social change while earning a solid return. Passion investing is purer \u2014 if not puritanical. And seeing how people who embrace it deploy their strategies shows just how hard it is to follow a passion in investing without some level of compromise.Its better-known cousin, impact investing, tends to attract people who are pragmatic. They are looking for the best possible investment in a sector, based on established criteria.In terms of its volume of greenhouse emissions, for example, a consumer packaging company will most likely score much higher among environmentalists than every company in the oil and gas sector. But a certain type of impact investor might look for the oil and gas company that has improved its business practices the most or is as environmentally responsible and progressive as such a company can be.Instead of swearing off whole sectors, this type of impact investor is looking to make a practical accommodation between today\u2019s reality and tomorrow\u2019s aspiration.Passion investors spurn such accommodations. They are driven by a belief in the primacy of a cause \u2014 animal rights, climate change, reducing waste \u2014 and try to apply that desire to all investment types. It\u2019s not easy.\u201cI have a conversation about this quite often,\u201d said Mark Doman, chief executive of the Doman Group, an investment adviser. \u201cClients talk about how their ethics and morality guide their portfolio. I tell them it\u2019s a very slippery slope to find companies that meet their ethical bar while keeping in mind their goal is to grow their assets.\u201dMr. Doman added, \u201cIf you can find me a morally and ethically pure blue-chip company, that\u2019s more the exception than the rule.\u201dRoyce Pinkwater, a real estate broker in Manhattan, is trying to find such companies that align with her passion \u2014 reducing pollution \u2014 but are also profitable. She has taken to analyzing individual securities through the lens of pollution. This has led to tough choices.She had been earning solid returns investing in Amazon when she began to be concerned about the company\u2019s relationship with its vendors and how those vendors sold and packaged products. Was Amazon monitoring how they did business? How concerned were Amazon and its vendors with reducing the waste caused by their packaging?When people make private investments guided by passion, the risk can seem higher. Losing all of your money in any private investment is always a possibility, particularly in early-stage ventures.But when people assess a private investment primarily on their perception of its underlying merit, it also narrows their options. Their passion, in effect, has limited what may already be a small field of suitable investments.\u201cI have to be willing for the money to go down the drain completely,\u201d he said.It has happened once, with an investment in a food technology company. \u201cIt was a good idea, basically trying to create a more automated supply chain for small farms and organic farms,\u201d Mr. Baltzell said. \u201cThat did not work out.\u201dHowever difficult investing with a pure vision may be, it also comes at the risk of hypocrisy. Mr. Doman has clients passionate about avoiding investments in fossil fuels who have duly refused to put money into oil and gas companies. But one of those clients was comfortable owning stocks in airlines, which, of course, need fossil fuels to fly.\u201cWe talked it through and they said: \u2018Aviation and air travel are an essential part of the economy, and it\u2019s something I use \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity. I guess I can\u2019t go that far,\u2019\u201d Mr. Doman said of the client. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to own BP, Royal Dutch Shell or Mobil, but they\u2019d own American Airlines or Delta. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s a very subjective assessment.\u201dSome investors have put parameters in place to stay focused on their passions but not to go broke.A strategy that loses money for years, like Mr. Holehouse\u2019s focus on renewables, is not one any professional investor could sustain and still be in business. But he said he and his wife did not need their investments to live. And being tied to the jewelry business, he said, has allowed them to invest in gems and rare metals that regular investors cannot access.\u201cKashmir sapphires have gone up 500 percent in the last decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, it gives us more room to let our conscience drive things.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Baltzell\u2019s approach in choosing his angel investments is, by his own admission, one of convenience: He looks at deals that come to him and meet his criteria of reducing waste. (Professional angel investors most likely look at 10 or 20 deals before investing in one or none.)But he limits his angel investments to 20 percent of his net worth. Even if they\u2019re successful, he reasons, they could take years to pay him back.\u201cIf I went totally with my heart, I\u2019d be doing this all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have trouble paying the school bills.\u201dAffluent investors can take a chance others wouldn\u2019t. The question is, Should they?Preston McSwain, managing partner of Fiduciary Wealth Partners in Boston, said being deeply interested in your investment decisions was generally a good thing but focusing almost myopically on a passion could have its downside.\u201cIf you have a very long time horizon it\u2019s certainly something you should spend time on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you need to be broadly diversified based on your goals and objectives.\u201dHe said a simple weighing of pros and cons could help even the most passionate investor gain perspective. The pros with a passion are clear \u2014 this is something the investor believes in.\u201cThe cons could be extreme concentration \u2014 that can help you reach your goals really fast or it gets blown up,\u201d Mr. McSwain said. \u201cAdvisers should try to get people to think why is this important and make sure they don\u2019t get overconcentrated in too much of a good thing.\u201dMs. Pinkwater is one who stepped back. She wanted to invest in Chinese internet companies, thinking this would be a market that would grow steadily. She bought stock in Tencent, the Chinese internet company that owns popular messaging apps like WeChat.But she ended up selling the stock because of Tencent\u2019s growing carbon footprint. She replaced it with Alphabet, the holding company for Google, YouTube and other technology companies. Google is well known for working to lower its carbon emissions, but is also known for getting out of China in 2010 and only now trying to return.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me the same exposure to China,\u201d Ms. Pinkwater said. \u201cI tried. I just wasn\u2019t comfortable with Tencent.\u201dThat is a perfectly dispassionate way to think of a passion investment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pedro Pascal: Making It at 41", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "After years of obscurity, the charismatic actor is finally getting some recognition, even if the fans who recognize him don\u2019t always get his name right.Supported byLONDON \u2014 Pedro Pascal was a little lost.He exited the Liverpool Street train station, staring at the glowing blue Google Maps dot on his iPhone screen. And that is when he nearly had an ending much like that of Oberyn Martell, the character he played on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dWhile crossing the street, he looked left when he should have looked right (classic error of the tourist in London), and a double-decker bus came thisclose.He barely had a moment to compose himself when he was spotted.\u201cPascal Pedro!\u201d said a young man, getting his name almost right. \u201cCan we get a photo? We love your character in \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019\u201dA little later, someone driving a white van in the narrow streets of Shoreditch hit the brakes. \u201cAgent Pe\u00f1a!\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Pascal\u2019s character in the Netflix series \u201cNarcos.\u201d \u201cExcellent, mate.\u201dAt 41, Mr. Pascal is far from a household name, but fame is rushing at him. As he described it, he has gone from decades of anonymity to becoming the \u201caren\u2019t you the guy from \u2026 ?\u201d guy.Soon enough, fans may even get his name right. In addition to his role on \u201cNarcos,\u201d Mr. Pascal appears in \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d a big-budget fantasy filmed mostly in Beijing that will be released in the United States on Feb. 17, after its splashy China debut. He will also have a lead role in the \u201cKingsman\u201d sequel, set for release later this year.After years of making ends meet with TV work and a prolific theater career, Mr. Pascal is not about to waste his chance. \u201cThe smallest of opportunities kept me going,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much so that I resolved to struggle until I couldn\u2019t walk anymore.\u201dAs the actress Sarah Paulson, one of his closest friends, put it: \u201cMost people don\u2019t get to be in their early 40s and have their lives change, workwise, in this business.\u201dThe change in his success means that Mr. Pascal has seen little of his apartment in West Hollywood, Calif., the past few years. He was in Europe for \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Colombia for \u201cNarcos,\u201d China for \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d and London for \u201cKingsman.\u201dAnd that\u2019s what brought him to a shop here on an afternoon before Christmas. He would be flying to Chile the next day to visit his family, and now, with the big paychecks coming in, he could spend a couple of hundred pounds to get Aesop soaps for his brother and adorable pajamas for his sister.\u201cI like to spoil her,\u201d he said, noting that he could never do it before.Mr. Pascal was born in Santiago, Chile, and raised in San Antonio and Orange County, Calif. He grew up dreaming of movies, which did little to help his social life. \u201cI was the one who wouldn\u2019t shut up about \u2018Empire of the Sun,\u2019\u201d he said.His parents fled Chile in the 1970s during the military junta and worked out a life of comfort in the United States. His father was a fertility doctor, and his mother, a former child psychologist, handed him the keys to her Volvo when he turned 16.Mr. Pascal and his sister did not join the rest of the family, sharing a shoe box apartment on Elizabeth Street in Manhattan as he pursued acting work. Theater assignments piled up, as did a few TV roles, including one-offs on \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cTouched by an Angel.\u201d Money was tight. At the Manhattan Theater Club, Mr. Pascal brought in about $515 a week.\u201cThe TV stuff means you\u2019re getting, in about three to eight days of work, more money than an entire run Off Broadway,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even a lot of money. You want \u2018Law & Order\u2019 so badly that you just want to die.\u201dAsked if he was ever typecast as a Latino, he said, \u201cI was desperate to be typecast so I could get a job.\u201d On the stages of New York, he said, he played a series of masculine gay men and vaguely ethnic characters. But breakout roles, both onstage and on television, proved elusive, and there were plenty of times when he was ready to quit.\u201cHe has a rather righteous sense of self,\u201d Ms. Paulson said. \u201cWhen I look back at it now, I do know there was always this voice deep down inside him that said someday he was going to do what he wanted to do in the manner in which he wanted to do it.\u201cBut the more you\u2019re told no, that little voice starts to get quieter and quieter, and it gets further and further away.\u201dThings changed about four years ago, thanks to a bit of hustling.While Mr. Pascal was mentoring a student at the University of Southern California, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was preparing to audition for a role as a late-30-something bisexual Lothario in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The student, in his 20s, was too young for the part, and when Mr. Pascal read the script, he was blown away. The role seemed made for him.He put together an audition tape, which he failed to mention to his younger friend. (For the record, the student, Francisco Garat, said in an interview that he was thrilled for Mr. Pascal\u2019s success.)Mr. Pascal asked Ms. Paulson if she could possibly, maybe pass along the tape to her best friend, Amanda Peet, who is married to the \u201cThrones\u201d co-creator David Benioff. Mr. Benioff, Ms. Peet and the show\u2019s other mastermind, D. B. Weiss, watched Mr. Pascal and the reviews were ecstatic. Ms. Paulson called to tell him.In 2014, Mr. Pascal became a fan favorite on the show as the swaggering Red Viper, a role that ended after one season, when his head was crushed by a character called the Mountain. But Mr. Pascal wasn\u2019t out of work for long. He was quickly cast in \u201cNarcos,\u201d a drama about the Colombian drug trade.When the director Matthew Vaughn was watching \u201cNarcos,\u201d he kept thinking, \u201cWho\u2019s this Burt Reynolds guy?\u201d He asked him to audition for \u201cKingsman,\u201d an action movie he was about to direct. The actor Mr. Vaughn saw before him was shaped by years of obscurity and missed chances.\u201cHe had this swagger and confidence,\u201d Mr. Vaughn said, \u201cbut at the same time such vulnerability of expecting to be rejected.\u201dSoon Mr. Pascal was fighting computer-generated mythical beasts alongside Matt Damon in \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d a Zhang Yimou epic that the Chinese film industry has positioned as a global blockbuster.Early box office returns have fallen short of expectations, but no matter. When Mr. Pascal started to reflect on his sudden star turn, he recalled a moment during his 40th birthday, when he was filming in Beijing.Mr. Damon and a producer asked to have a word with him. For an actor long accustomed to coming up short, it was an unnerving request. As they led him off the set, the cast and crew surrounded him. Next thing he knew, a giant birthday cake was being rolled out and fireworks lit up the sky.\u201cI\u2019m turning 40 and I\u2019m in Beijing,\u201d Mr. Pascal said. \u201cI am absolutely fine with experiencing my birthday anonymously and with a day at work. And, instead, I got a big freaking cake and fireworks. I was like, \u2018What the hell is happening?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beard Envy", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMirrorMy grandfather didn\u2019t always shave alone. In the modest guest bathroom of our house in Orlando, Fla., sometimes I was there at his side, wanting to shave with him \u2014 or pretend to.He would fill the sink with hot water, grab a disposable razor, hand me one with a plastic guard covering the blade, and together we would lather up. I remember the sandpaper sound the razor made as it scraped away his whiskers. I couldn\u2019t wait to be able to do the same.At age 15 I finally had some stubble, but it was so sparse that my face looked as if it were specked with dirt. I checked the mirror and told myself I would be able to grow a beard by age 18.At 20 I started growing out my whiskers in an attempt to look older for a role, Judge Brack in Ibsen\u2019s \u201cHedda Gabler.\u201d After two months the results were in: bare cheeks, a fuzzy brown mustache, seven chin hairs. It was embarrassing, given that the 18-year-old playing Hedda\u2019s love interest had grown a thick beard in a week. I comforted myself with the notion that I would have better luck by age 25.Now I\u2019m 27. Although beards have been in fashion for years, I have stayed cleanshaven, for the most part, ever since the \u201cHedda Gabler\u201d debacle. If I happen to go two weeks without a shave, my friends tease me or a girlfriend will say: \u201cI like it. I just think you look better without it.\u201dLate last year, at a bar, I looked around and noticed I was the only man there, including the bartender, without a lush growth on his face. I decided to commit. No shaving for a month.It hit me pretty hard, accepting that I wouldn\u2019t be able to join the ranks of the bearded, but in the end, it\u2019s just genetics. I\u2019ll have to settle for a respectable mustache, goatee and sideburns. That\u2019s worth something, especially if I ever end up playing Snidely Whiplash.For now I will work with what I have while looking toward a hairier future. Men with beards have told me their beards improve with age. And so with that wisdom I can say for certain that by 50 I\u2019ll be able to grow one at last.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PewDiePie Dust-Up Shows Risks Brands Take to Tap Into Social Media", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingSocial media has produced its own breed of stars, from the video bloggers of YouTube to the style mavens of Instagram, and major media companies and brands have increasingly turned to this group as a way to reach the ad blockers and cord cutters of the world.But they also come with their own set of risks.The episode has raised questions about the level of vetting and oversight that advertisers and media companies extend to social media stars in the zeal to reach their followers. It has also made some wonder about the type of content being financed through these deals.\u201cThey\u2019re not coming to the table thinking about how a brand is going to react to their behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cThey care more about being themselves than what a brand thinks of them.\u201dThat has led advertisers and media companies closer to boundaries that they may have previously considered off limits, especially when it comes to influencers who have amassed fans at least partly through shock value.The Maker unit of Disney, which zealously protects its brand, did not defend Mr. Kjellberg\u2019s videos in a statement last week, but noted that he had built his following \u201cby being provocative and irreverent.\u201d\u201cBrands need to start looking at working with influencers the same way they\u2019ve approached celebrity and athlete endorsements,\u201d said Gabe Gordon, a managing partner at Reach, an agency that specializes in social videos. \u201cMost brands, when they\u2019re investing a certain level of money in people, they\u2019re doing full background checks, they\u2019re working with P.R. agencies to understand potential risks, they\u2019re doing audits of every piece of content they\u2019ve been in or associated with.\u201dHe added, \u201cInfluencers are a bit of a challenge that way because they\u2019re creating hundreds or thousands of hours of content, and they take down videos, too, so you have to go beyond the existing content that\u2019s published, really know the person and know what they\u2019ve stood for throughout their career.\u201d\u201cThere is really a microscope now on brands\u2019 values and value messaging because of the political state of the world right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBrands can\u2019t really be completely silent, and they\u2019re being called out.\u201dAlthough Disney declined on Friday to answer specific questions about the degree to which it vetted Maker content before or after the acquisition \u2014 if at all \u2014 the company said in a statement that Maker had almost no input in the content anyway. Like other so-called multichannel networks, Maker functions largely in a back-of-house role, handling functions like marketing, sales and analytics.\u201cInfluencers who are part of the Maker network are independent creators, and Maker does not have editorial control over the vast majority of the content,\u201d the statement said.Still, Disney is moving to bring more focus to its Maker stable. Maker is expected to undergo another round of layoffs in coming days, which will include the whittling of its network to about 300 top creators, a reduction that had been planned before the PewDiePie brouhaha. Last summer, Maker laid off about 30 people.Brooks Barnes contributed reporting.Follow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter @Sapna.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feeling \u2018Pressure All the Time\u2019 on Europe\u2019s Treadmill of Temporary Work", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter graduating with degrees in accounting and finance from a university in Finland, Ville Markus Kieloniemi thought he would at least find an entry-level job in his field. He studied potential employers, tailoring his applications accordingly.He wound up churning through eight temporary jobs over the next three years. He worked variously as a hotel receptionist and as a salesman in men\u2019s clothing stores, peddling tailored suits and sportswear.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to manage your finances or even get housing, let alone start a career,\u201d said Mr. Kieloniemi, 23, who added depth to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by accepting unpaid office jobs and internships in New York and Spain, mostly at his own expense. \u201cYou feel pressure all the time.\u201dMeet the new generation of permatemps in Europe.For those stuck in this employment netherworld, life is a cycle of constant job searches. Confidence can give way to doubt as career prospects seem to fade. Young people talk of delaying marriage and families indefinitely. And though many were grateful for any workplace experience, they were also cynical about companies that treated them like disposable labor.What follows is a selection of experiences from this growing group of permatemps: an Italian oncologist who spent almost as much time trying to find her next three-month contract as she did helping cancer patients; a French human-resources expert grappling with the psychological toll of temporary work; and, among others, a German tourism specialist who gave up his passion for a stable job in an unrelated field.The search for temporary employment can be a full-time job.Alessandra Sisco, Doctor\u2018I\u2019d fix up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 all the time, and that\u2019s your life.\u2019Alessandra Sisco, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer patients, never dreamed she would have to leave her home in Italy to find steady work. But in a stagnant economy, she was trapped in a web of short-term contracts.Since finishing her five-year oncology residency in 2012, she has only been able to get three- to five-month temporary contracts that Italy\u2019s public and private hospitals largely rely on to manage staffing. The full-time jobs often went to people from well-connected families, or those with ties to senior hospital officials.She became stuck in a loop, trying to divine whether her jobs might be extended, and struggling to land another position since they usually weren\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019d fix up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 all the time, and that\u2019s your life,\u201d Mrs. Sisco, 35, said.\u201cI was constantly looking for something else,\u201d she added. \u201cI was held back. There was no professional growth, and the earnings were low.\u201dTemporary employees are paid an average of 19 percent less than their permanent counterparts, according to Eurofound, the research arm of the European Union.In November, she interviewed for hospital internships in New York. \u2018\u2018At least there would be hope for the future,\u201d she said.Temporary work has become widespread in the United States, too, where the explosion of the so-called gig economy has made job-hopping the new norm for a growing pool of young workers. But the situation is verging on the extreme in Europe, giving the perniciousness of the problem the potential to play on an entire generation. Millions of people across Europe are searching for work amid jobless rates that are still nearly twice as high as in the United States.Relocating would mean having to do a new five-year residency on top of her extensive training and experience. But the prospect of spending her career as a doctor doing temporary work was more than she could bear.\u201cWhen I started thinking of moving, I stopped thinking about what I was not getting,\u201d said Mrs. Sisco, who hopes to be able to move her family and start a new life in the coming months.\u201cWhen you see that you\u2019re actually appreciated for your work, you\u2019re happy,\u201d she added excitedly. \u201cFinally, I will have peace of mind because I know everything I\u2019ve worked for is going to be earned and deserved.\u201dStarting a family or getting a mortgage can be a major challenge.Sam Mee, Social Analysis and Research \u2018I was forced to put off big life decisions.\u2019At 36, Sam Mee thought his life would have been settled by now. A career in research and social policy. A family. A home. At the very least a cellphone.But even the basics can be unachievable, as Mr. Mee finds himself on a treadmill of temporary contracts.\u201cI had this idea that I would study hard, work hard, get the job I studied for, then ask my girlfriend to marry me,\u201d Mr. Mee said.A British national, Mr. Mee thought his master\u2019s studies in social analysis would make him attractive to companies and nongovernmental organizations that research behaviors and trends. \u201cI\u2019d buy a house and have kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the dream.\u201dHe moved to Amsterdam before the financial crisis to be with his girlfriend and to start his career. Yet in a country where more than 20 percent of job contracts are temporary, he was never able to find permanent work in his area of expertise. He now has a temporary contract with a firm that does business-to-business collections, including calling airlines to settle outstanding invoices.The temporary-work trend is accelerating around Europe, as employers seek more flexibility to fire and hire workers, and shun permanent contracts with expensive costs and labor protections. In Spain alone, the government reported that 18 million temporary contracts were handed out last year, compared with 1.7 million long-term jobs.\u201cI want a career more than anything, but I feel like I\u2019m in a position where a 25-year-old would be,\u201d said Mr. Mee, who has hired a job coach and set up his own website to improve his prospects. \u201cI was forced to put off big life decisions.\u201d\u201cYou feel stuck,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re young, you have a lot to offer, but no one will give you a chance.\u201dTemporary contracts blocked more than just his career. Real estate agents were reluctant to deal with Mr. Mee, and it was impossible to get a mortgage at the bank. Nor could he obtain a credit card, lacking steady income. Even mobile-phone companies would not give him a contract; he had to get one through his girlfriend, who has a full-time job as a midwife.\u201cBut in the end,\u201d Mr. Mee said, \u201cI was like, to hell with it. I\u2019m not going to keep putting life on hold because the market won\u2019t let me.\u201dRecently, he asked his girlfriend to marry him. She accepted; the wedding is planned for this year.\u201cWe want to do everything 50-50,\u201d he said, before pausing. \u201cBut everything\u2019s just a little bit tight.\u201dA revolving door of work exerts a psychological toll.Charles Terraz, Human Resources\u2018It\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of burnout or depression.\u2019Charles Terraz never used to live with chronic stress, health scares or recurring anxiety. But these days, they have become close companions as he bounces through a series of temporary contracts as a recruiter at industrial and pharmaceutical companies, each of which leaves him a little more drained and racked by uncertainty about his career.Armed with a master\u2019s degree in human resources and economics and business degrees, Mr. Terraz, a native of Lyon, France, was confident of finding work at a large company. Yet in the country\u2019s struggling economy, where more than 80 percent of all new hires are temporary, that proved virtually impossible.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stress about the future and money,\u201d said Mr. Terraz, who is 29. \u201cThe fear of becoming unemployed weighs on you.\u201dThat precariousness fueled sleepless nights and nagging self-doubts. He sustained severe stress and recurring migraines, spending two weeks recovering in a hospital. \u201cIt was a horrible experience,\u201d he said.Today, Mr. Terraz is a recruiter at a French pharmaceutical company, but only for six months. The stress over money and finding the next job remains. \u201cYou have to keep a smile and be mentally strong,\u201d he said. In private, though, \u201cyou feel excluded from society.\u201d\u201cThree years ago, I had dreams, ambitions for a great career,\u201d he added. \u201cBut right now I have nothing. It\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of burnout or depression sometimes. If I was the only one this was happening to, O.K., but most of my friends are in the same position.\u201dTreating employees like disposable labor is bad for companies, too.Joost Minnaar, Scientist\u2018In one fell swoop, all our excitement and engagement vanished.\u2019Joost Minnaar, an industrious Dutchman, had a dream job in Barcelona, Spain, as a nanotechnologist at a German company with 30 other scientists, working on new developments for television, tablet and computer displays. Each held one-year renewable contracts, with the promise of potentially going full time after two years.It never happened.The company was hiring groups of 30 scientists at a time on temporary contracts, which management would let expire to avoid the cost of hiring people full time. Mr. Minnaar and his colleagues discovered that they were the third such group in four years.It is an increasing reality across Europe. Since 2012, just 20 percent of temporary workers have made the leap to full-time work, according to Eurofound.\u201cWe were trapped in the strategy of this multinational, which was just waiting to discard us after two years of hard work,\u201d Mr. Minnaar said. \u201cIn one fell swoop, all our excitement and engagement vanished.\u201dMorale slumped.\u201cProductivity became really bad, and people started to become really disengaged from work, which was strange because we were doing interesting stuff,\u201d he recalled.Employees dragged their feet on projects and openly looked for jobs. Others grew wary of colleagues, whom they viewed as competitors for any permanent jobs that might arise elsewhere at the firm.\u201cBy doing this, the company was destroying their own workers,\u201d said Mr. Minnaar, who is 30. \u201cThe lesson was, if you treat people like this, if you don\u2019t give them security or trust over the long term, they won\u2019t do a good job for you.\u201dTaking any job just to survive means dealing with trade-offs.Cristian Meiler, Tourism and Hospitality\u2018There\u2019s a sense that you\u2019ve given in, that you\u2019ve surrendered.\u2019Cristian Meiler had always worked in tourism and hospitality in Spain, following a passion that had grabbed him as a teenager. He served as a hotel bellhop in his hometown, Barcelona, manned reception desks, and waited tables at restaurants. He is fluent in five languages and has a degree in hotel management.Despite decades of experience, he never managed to land a prized full-time job. When a permanent offer did come, however, he hesitated.Mr. Meiler had been working a temporary job at a sports equipment company\u2019s call center in Barcelona to help supplement his income from short-term contracts at hotels and cruise ships, where he welcomed and checked in guests. Accepting a full-time gig as a service representative at the sports company in Munich would mean abandoning his career path.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that you\u2019ve given in, that you\u2019ve surrendered,\u201d said Mr. Meiler, 35, who remembers accompanying his mother, a tour guide, as a youth around Spain. \u201cYou want to stay on the path you\u2019ve been working on for so long.\u201cThen I thought, what if there is no better job waiting for me?\u201d he continued. \u201cI needed work. I needed stability. And you always have the sense that I can\u2019t complain, because there\u2019s millions of other people without a job.\u201dMr. Meiler has adapted quickly to his new role in Germany, and he feels lucky to be working in a collegial atmosphere.Still, sometimes a nagging voice whispers that he took the easy way out. If he could find a stable job in his field back in Spain, he said, \u201cI\u2019d be on a plane the next day.\u201dA sense of relief accompanies a permanent job.Laura Hickey, Arts\u2018It\u2019s definitely good to have security.\u2019In a typical week, Laura Hickey, 26, was spending three days working at a theater in Edinburgh under a contract with no guaranteed income. The rest of the week was devoted to sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and angling for interviews in a bid to nail an elusive permanent job. She worked at three companies, including a youth orchestra and an arts foundation, just in the past year.After struggling for nearly two years, Ms. Hickey, who studied art history, finally got lucky: Last month, she landed a full-time job at the Scottish Rugby Association as a ticket sales representative.\u201cIt was an immense relief,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was harder than I ever thought it would be to get permanent work, but now I can get settled and focus on the future, without worrying about having to find the next thing.\u201dShe now has steady hours at an office every day, a regular paycheck with overtime, and a sense that she can settle down and start forging some kind of a career path. Her passion is still the arts, but her new job may present opportunities that she had never dreamed of. And in a dicey job market, she figures it is better to start working her way up the ladder where she is rather than risk starting all over again.\u201cI\u2019m keeping an open mind,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely good to have security.\u201dPalko Karasz contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Look of \u201970s SoHo \u2014 Captured in One Apartment", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack when SoHo was a frontier, a place promising infinite possibility for limited funds, the neighborhood\u2019s 19th-century cast-iron buildings began to fill up with struggling artists. The lofts, as they would come to be called \u2014 entire floors in former factories and warehouses gone to seed \u2014 were drafty in winter, noisy in summer and challenged when it came to plumbing, but who cared when you were getting thousands of feet of raw space for as little as $100 a month? By 1970, galleries were opening, and restaurants and bars soon followed. The artists Gordon Matta-Clark and Carol Goodden opened the restaurant Food on the corner of Prince and Wooster in 1971, fueling the neighborhood\u2019s growing mythology of the artist as urban pioneer. Things got fancier in 1977, when Giorgio DeLuca teamed up with Joel Dean and Jack Ceglic to open the first Dean & DeLuca half a block away on Prince Street. A cavernous space, its white walls and industrial shelving were designed by Ceglic, a painter, to honor the building\u2019s factory roots. The shelves, stocked with then-rare American and European foods (fine olive oils, balsamic vinegars, baby vegetables) became proxy larders for, among others, Donald Judd, who had bought an entire building on Spring Street.One of the first SoHo lofts featured in The New York Times was, as it happened, the Wooster Street home of Dean and Ceglic, who, in 1969, paid $20,000 for one of the seven floors in a warehouse building (their floor previously housed a doll factory), before industrial conversions were legal. A photo of the place caught the eye of Ronnie Sassoon, then a young woman living in Cincinnati: \u201cI saw it and thought, This is where I would live if I lived in New York.\u201dRonnie Sassoon and James Crump\u2019s SoHo apartment harks back to another era.\u00a0Sassoon would go on to become a model, then an art historian, eventually marrying the hairstylist Vidal Sassoon in the early \u201990s. But even as she lived in London and Los Angeles, where she restored a Richard Neutra house, she kept that New York loft in her head. After Vidal died in 2012 and she met her current partner, the filmmaker James Crump, they began to look in earnest for her \u201cdream space.\u201d The search was fruitless for some time. Each of the many places they saw \u201chad been renovated as the neighborhood became more desirable, and that meant dividing them up with walls and doors in really weird and awkward ways,\u201d Sassoon says. \u201cI saw so much ugly flocked and foiled wallpaper, nasty sconces, over-the-top flourishes \u2014 all of which I would have gutted anyway.\u201dThe couple had almost given up when, two years ago, Sassoon received a call from her agent: An untouched loft had just come up for sale. \u201cI walked through the door and my eyes just filled with tears,\u201d she says. \u201cI realized it was the very same loft I\u2019d seen all those years ago.\u201dDean died in 2004, but Ceglic was still living there when they bought it from him in 2014. Other than adding new appliances, central air conditioning (requiring a two-year battle with the building\u2019s co-op board), a small room for a bathtub and an exhaust fan in the kitchen, it remains virtually unchanged. \u201cWe feel like this place is living history,\u201d Sassoon says, \u201cwhich is one of the reasons we didn\u2019t want to alter it.\u201dEntering their home, in fact, is not unlike stepping into a time capsule, particularly as it is filled with the mostly Italian \u201970s-era art and furniture that Sassoon has been collecting, with spooky foresight, for decades. It all works perfectly with the exoskeletal aesthetic of early New York lofts. \u201cI love that this brings the water to the kitchen,\u201d Sassoon says, pointing to the silver pipe that runs up the back wall of the space, across the ceiling and into the sink. Some of the recipes for \u201cThe Dean & DeLuca Cookbook,\u201d published in 1996, were tested in this kitchen, on the wooden tops of the mobile islands built by Ceglic and reminiscent of Joe Colombo\u2019s Carrellone mini-kitchen of the \u201960s. Ceglic and Dean were young and broke when they moved into the loft, so Ceglic made virtually everything himself, including the Judd-like kitchen cupboards, with their plywood shelves repurposed from an old bookcase. A lamp hanging over the toilet was ingeniously constructed from cheap parts found on Canal Street. \u201cI was going to put a Colombo lamp in the water closet,\u201d Sassoon says, \u201cbut then I thought, Why? Jack\u2019s is so perfect.\u201dThe master bedroom and the guest room are essentially two back-to-back beds, separated only by a plywood cabinet that housed Ceglic\u2019s canvas stretchers (now, with doors, a closet). Privacy is not an option unless you repair to the toilet, the bathtub or the original shower, with its curved stall. \u201cWe call it the Orgasmatron, of course,\u201d Sassoon says, referring to the futuristic cabinet from the 1973 Woody Allen comedy \u201cSleeper.\u201dShe and Crump are avowed minimalists and, not surprisingly, Sassoon was a fan of Ad Hoc Softwares, the SoHo pioneers of industrial design (they single-handedly made Metro wire shelving de rigueur in the \u201980s). Back in the day, Sassoon says, \u201cI used to go there every time I came to New York.\u201d That clean, straightforward aesthetic thrives here. \u201cI can\u2019t live with too many fabrics or textures \u2014 or color for that matter,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like window treatments or flowers, and I\u2019m funny about carpet.\u201dIt makes sense then, that Sassoon collects pieces from Arte Povera and Zero artists; the two movements emphasized work that was simple in form, monochromatic and made with humble materials. The apartment, with its fine examples by G\u00fcnther Uecker, Enrico Castellani, Lucio Fontana and Agostino Bonalumi, could double as a gallery. A copper piece by Fontana in the living area was borrowed by the Guggenheim Museum for a 2006 show. \u201cI must have known I would end up in New York when I bought it because Fontana made it after his first visit here,\u201d Sassoon says. \u201cIt\u2019s influenced by the copper-tinted windows of the Seagram Building. He famously exclaimed of the trip, \u2018New York is more beautiful than Venice!\u2019\u2009\u201dAt the far end of the loft, a work by Jan Henderikse, one of Zero\u2019s few Dutch members, is composed of discarded wooden vegetable crates. Sassoon says she imagined it in its current spot the first time she visited the loft. Crump Googled the 80-year-old artist and found he was living in Brooklyn. \u201cIt was crazy, like it was meant to be,\u201d Crump says. Henderikse shipped crates, stored in his Antwerp studio, to New York, where he and Sassoon erected the piece, connecting the boxes with fishing wire. Heat from sunlight has caused the nylon wire to stretch, shifting the crates slightly, \u201cbut I like the wabi-sabi look of it \u2014 I don\u2019t really want it to be perfect,\u201d she says.When the sun shines through the boxes, beautiful shapes play on the milky wooden floors, which Crump and Sassoon left untouched. \u201cIt\u2019s some kind of marine epoxy paint you can\u2019t find anymore,\u201d Crump says. \u201cWe were going to have it repainted, but the patina is so amazing \u2014 you couldn\u2019t improve on what age did naturally.\u201d (The closest the apartment comes to a carpet is a large, irregular stain on the floor, created by one of the doll factory\u2019s machines and never repaired by Ceglic. \u201cI call it my area rug,\u201d Sassoon quips.)The couple follows the light through the day, as it travels around the loft, which explains the two dining areas: The more formal white marble table, designed by Sassoon and next to the kitchen, is generally for dinner; the black Angelo Mangiarotti table, at the sunnier end of the loft, is for breakfast and lunch. The light fixture above it, from the avant-garde design collective Superstudio, surveys the room like a giant eyeball.Crump and Sassoon met just four years ago, but the two seem separated at birth, right down to their fondness for black clothing. Sassoon was visiting her family in Ohio and Crump was working as the chief curator of the Cincinnati Art Museum when a mutual friend introduced them. Crump, who also grew up in the Midwest, had been writing and editing art books for years, in addition to directing and producing the 2007 documentary \u201cBlack White + Gray: A Portrait of Sam Wagstaff and Robert Mapplethorpe.\u201d They quickly bonded over their love of art, and since getting together the couple has made two more films: 2015\u2019s \u201cTroublemakers: The Story of Land Art,\u201d and the upcoming \u201cAntonio Lopez 1970: Sex Fashion & Disco,\u201d about the influential illustrator, who died of AIDS in 1987.In further arguments for destiny, Sassoon tells me that 20 years before making \u201cTroublemakers\u201d with Crump, she and Vidal bought the loft\u2019s two acrylic columns by the land artist Charles Ross \u2014 a piece created in SoHo in 1968. And the new documentary, about Lopez, covers 1968 to 1973. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of fitting,\u201d Crump says, \u201chow both of the films we\u2019ve done take place around 1970, the year Joel and Jack moved into the loft.\u201dCrump says he first came to New York because of the energy of the city back then, when \u201cmusicians, painters, actors, sculptors, illustrators and fashion people all smashed together and collaborated in Lower Manhattan. It was a small, incestuous world, and it produced an incredible moment in time,\u201d he notes. \u201cThere was a sense of attainability, that anything was possible.\u201dSometimes, Crump adds, when Wooster Street gets quiet, in the early morning or late at night, \u201cyou get a taste of what SoHo must have been like then.\u201dAt top: The guest bedroom area, with a bed from B&B Italia, is separated from the master bedroom by a floating closet, which is draped with a rope piece by the artist Barry Flanagan; the desk, designed in 1969, is by Maurice Calka.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Not Everyone in Tech Cheers Visa Program for Foreign Workers", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The \u201cknowledge transfer sessions\u201d started a few months after Jeff Tan received notice last summer that he and about 80 co-workers would be laid off by the University of California, San Francisco, at the end of February.At daily two-hour meetings with employees from HCL Technologies, an Indian tech services company that had landed the outsourcing contract from U.C.S.F., Mr. Tan trained HCL staff members in India by videoconference and employees brought to the United States on H-1B visas how to do his job.But for tech workers like Mr. Tan, the program has had very negative consequences.\u201cI thought the purpose of H-1B visas was to give America a competitive edge, not help companies ship American jobs abroad,\u201d said Mr. Tan, who had worked for the university as an information technology systems administrator for 20 years. \u201cThis is now standard practice in the technology industry.\u201dA research report by Goldman Sachs estimates that 900,000 to a million H-1B visa holders now reside in the United States, and that they account for up to 13 percent of American technology jobs.In 2014, 13 outsourcing firms accounted for one-third of all H-1B visas. They use a loophole in the current first-come, first-served lottery system to flood the applicant pool with their candidates. In many cases, those candidates are paid slightly more than the $60,000-a-year minimum salary required by the program for dependent companies seeking a waiver from having to recruit Americans first \u2014 but less than what American technology workers make.Audrey Hatten-Milholin, 54, was notified in July that she would be laid off from the University of California, San Francisco, at the end of February after 17 years in its technology department. Along with eight others, she filed a complaint in November with California\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, charging that replacing her and others with \u201csignificantly younger, male\u201d workers \u201cwho will then perform the work overseas\u201d was discriminatory.\u201cWe are at a disadvantage as Americans,\u201d Ms. Hatten-Milholin said. \u201cThey look at it like, where can we get it cheaper? And for U.C., it\u2019s not here.\u201dProponents of the H-1B system argue that it is an important vehicle to attract top talent to America. After coming to the United States, these visa holders may apply their skills to start new companies or create new, innovative products \u2014 leading to more jobs in America.The debate over who wins and who loses as a result of the H-1B visa program echoes similar discussions of how free trade helps or hurts the economy. While the benefits are spread broadly throughout the economy, the costs are much more concentrated and easy to identify.After 11 years working in the I.T. department of Northeast Utilities, a Connecticut-based company now named Eversource Energy, Craig Diangelo was among 220 employees laid off in 2014. Before leaving the company, he was told he needed to train his replacement if he wanted to receive his severance.Mr. Diangelo, who is now 64 and was receiving $130,000 a year in salary and bonus, said he trained an employee from the Indian outsourcing firm Infosys who was an H-1B visa holder making $60,000 a year. There was also a team of workers in India making $6,000 a year that shadowed him on the computer.\u201cThe problem,\u201d he said, \u201cis that my job is still there. I went away. The American worker went away.\u201dA representative of Infosys declined to comment. Al Lara, a spokesman for Eversource Energy, said in a statement: \u201cWe made changes to our I.T. department three years ago during a period of transition and change to support the merger of our two companies while under much regulatory scrutiny. We are proud of the new I.T. organization.\u201d Mr. Lara was referring to a merger with NStar in 2012.In other instances, the jobs are filled only temporarily by H-1B workers \u2014 before the outsourcing firm moves the job permanently to a lower-cost country.\u201cThat\u2019s the endgame,\u201d said Sara Blackwell, a lawyer representing former employees of Walt Disney Company, Abbott Laboratories and other companies in discrimination claims pertaining to tech-job outsourcing.\u201cI\u2019m sure employers might not have as much choice as they would like, but if the shortage story were true, we\u2019d see wages rising more rapidly than they are,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. There is substantial unemployment, Mr. Baker said, even among workers in so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.Lawrence F. Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard, said companies like the H-1B visa program because it expands the pool of applicants. That means having to pay less in salary and retaining more control over employees.\u201cFrom the point of view of an economist, there are two big winners,\u201d he added. \u201cThe workers who come here with H-1B visas and the companies that employ them.\u201dWhile it remains to be seen what Mr. Trump will do, various members of Congress have proposed measures to change the H-1B system. One idea is to raise the $60,000-salary threshold for some H-1B workers to $100,000 or more. The hope is that this will narrow the gap between the standard pay for an American tech worker and that of a foreign worker.Another proposed measure is to change the current first-come, first-served lottery system that is benefiting outsourcing firms. Yet another idea is for a salary bidding system, in which companies bid on what they would be willing to pay an applicant, potentially making it more difficult to flood the applicant pool with lower-cost workers.According to the University of California, San Francisco, technology costs to run U.C.S.F. Health, which encompasses the university\u2019s hospital, medical center and patient care facilities, have tripled from 2011 to 2016. Outsourcing technology jobs will save the university more than $30 million over the next five years.But this argument has not spared the university from criticism for outsourcing the jobs because \u2014 as a public institution \u2014 it receives taxpayer funds and is a nonprofit organization.The university said neither it nor HCL would replace the laid-off employees with H-1B workers, although it acknowledges that HCL brought in some H-1B workers initially to understand the institution\u2019s technology needs. Those workers, U.C.S.F. said, are no longer working on the account.Mr. Tan, 55, said he was not worried about returning to the job market in a few weeks and understood why the university took such measures. However, he is concerned about what his children will do when they start looking for work.\u201cToday it\u2019s me, but tomorrow it\u2019s going to be a doctor or an engineer,\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do you draw the line?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the H-1B program\u2019s minimum salary requirement. The minimum salary is for dependent companies that seek a waiver from having to recruit Americans first, not for all companies hiring H-1B candidates.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Struggles to Capitalize on Influence and Posts Lackluster Earnings", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports fans were glued to it during the Super Bowl. Millions used it to track American election night results. In the morning, the president of the United States sends a daily missive in the form of a tweetstorm.\u201cYou don\u2019t go a day without hearing about Twitter,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s chief executive, said on a conference call with investors Thursday morning.There is just one problem: For all of its influence, Twitter cannot seem to capitalize on its wide reach.Twitter, which has long aspired to bring its social network to wider audiences globally, added only two million users in the fourth quarter of 2016, taking its total number to 319 million over all. Facebook, by contrast, added tens of millions, its strongest user growth since it became a public company, and it is closing in on two billion worldwide users.That difficulty growing its user base has finally caught up to its financial performance. The company noted that as it moves to \u201creset\u201d itself and tries to focus on making its product more attractive to wide audiences, revenue growth will slow and may continue to do so in the future.Shares of Twitter fell 12 percent to $16.41, erasing the gains made this month.Part of Twitter\u2019s problems are Facebook and Google, the 900-pound gorillas that dominate digital advertising. Over the first half of 2016, marketers spent some $5.7 billion on Facebook advertising alone in the United States, which represented 43 percent of digital advertising growth domestically, according to estimates from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.As a result, Twitter is going back to figure out the different types of ads it can offer advertisers.Some of those may be focused on the company\u2019s live video products, an effort borne out of deals negotiated by Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer. Mr. Noto said that video advertising was the company\u2019s most valuable ad product for the quarter and that it would be a focus for the future.Others said they believed that Twitter\u2019s renewed focus on cleaning up problems with abuse of users on its platform, which Mr. Dorsey said would be a priority in 2017, might make coming to Twitter more attractive for new users and, important, new advertisers.\u201cThey\u2019ve been rolling out many new features and tackling issues such as abuse, all positively received by both users and brands,\u201d said Joshua March, chief executive of Conversocial, a social media customer engagement company. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be seeing more revenue in the future as they become a partner to major brands across the customer life cycle.\u201dTwitter\u2019s management team pushed back on those concerns, pointing to the year ahead as an opportunity for growth after a long, painful 2016.

{"Headline": "A Lawsuit Against Uber Highlights the Rush to Conquer Driverless Cars", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Late last year, Uber, in defiance of California state regulators, went ahead with a self-driving car experiment on the streets of San Francisco under the leadership of Anthony Levandowski, a new company executive.The experiment quickly ran into problems. In one case, an autonomous Volvo zoomed through a red light on a busy street in front of the city\u2019s Museum of Modern Art.Uber, a ride-hailing service, said the incident was because of human error. \u201cThis is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers,\u201d Chelsea Kohler, a company spokeswoman, said in December.But even though Uber said it had suspended an employee riding in the Volvo, the self-driving car was, in fact, driving itself when it barreled through the red light, according to two Uber employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they signed nondisclosure agreements with the company, and internal Uber documents viewed by The New York Times. All told, the mapping programs used by Uber\u2019s cars failed to recognize six traffic lights in the San Francisco area. \u201cIn this case, the car went through a red light,\u201d the documents said.The legal battle also provides a rare glimpse into the high-stakes world of top technology talent, where star engineers like Mr. Levandowski, who played a central role in Google\u2019s pioneering autonomous car project, command huge sums of money to try to help define a company\u2019s technological future.After leaving Google in January 2016, Mr. Levandowski formed the self-driving truck company Otto. About six months later, Uber bought Otto for $680 million, and Mr. Levandowski became Uber\u2019s vice president in charge of its self-driving car project.Waymo filed a lawsuit on Thursday in federal court against Uber and Otto, accusing Mr. Levandowski and Uber of planning to steal trade secrets.The suit said Mr. Levandowski retrieved information from a highly confidential server with designs of crucial technologies used in its autonomous vehicles in the month before he resigned from Google, where he had spent nine years working on maps and self-driving cars.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Alphabet and Uber view autonomous vehicles as using critical technology that may upend the automobile industry. Google started working on driverless cars around the time when Uber was formed, and Google is eager to prove that, despite its size and past successes, it can still innovate like a start-up. And replacing human drivers with self-driving cars would allow Uber to theoretically provide safer rides around the clock. Robot cars would also allow the ride-hailing service to avoid one of its biggest headaches \u2014 its drivers.\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to our mission about being part of the future,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview in August after announcing Otto\u2019s acquisition. \u201cThis is not a side project. This is existential for us.\u201dEngineers like Mr. Levandowski are part of a limited pool of people with the experience and capability to lead efforts on self-driving cars. They are wooed by traditional automakers looking to acquire new technical talent and tech companies, both established firms and start-ups, who see the opportunity to use artificial intelligence and sensors to disrupt another industry.\u201cWhat\u2019s in these people\u2019s heads is hugely in demand,\u201d because the talent pool \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have enough miles under the wheels,\u201d said Martha Josephson, a partner in the Palo Alto, Calif., office of Egon Zehnder, an executive recruiting firm.Current and former co-workers of Mr. Levandowski, who asked for anonymity because they did not have permission to speak to reporters, said he was aggressive and determined with an entrepreneurial streak.Since leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski, 36, has embodied the Silicon Valley ethos that it is better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.Uber said in a statement that the lawsuit was a \u201cbaseless attempt to slow down a competitor,\u201d and declined to make Mr. Levandowski available.But in an internal email to Uber employees obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Levandowski said that Otto did not steal any of Google\u2019s intellectual property, and that self-driving technology has been his life\u2019s passion, having worked on it since his college days. He alluded to sharing more information with employees when he could in the future.A Waymo spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would refer its claims to law enforcement.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.He joined Google in 2007 as part of its Maps team and helped to build the company\u2019s Street View product. When Google gave the green light to begin working on a self-driving car in 2009, Mr. Thrun picked Mr. Levandowski for the original team.During Mr. Levandowski\u2019s time on Google\u2019s self-driving car project, the company\u2019s advances pushed autonomous vehicles out of the realm of science fiction. By late 2016, nearly 60 of Google\u2019s self-driving cars had driven more than two million miles on the road in four different states. But according to former co-workers, Mr. Levandowski became frustrated with the pace of progress at Google, worrying that the company was squandering its technical advantage by not moving fast enough.But that test drive was carried out without the proper permits and against the will of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, a move that the agency eventually called \u201cillegal.\u201dWhen asked on Friday about the incident with the red traffic light, Ms. Kohler, the Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement: \u201cOur self-driving technology required human intervention. The vehicle operator had time to intervene, but failed to take over before crossing the stop line and manually proceeded through the protected crosswalk.\u201dIn December, Uber said it remained \u201c100 percent committed\u201d to eventually bringing autonomous vehicles to California.An article on Saturday about talent in the driverless technology field referred incorrectly to comments by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer who started the self-driving truck company Otto, which was bought by Uber and is at the center of a lawsuit by another autonomous car business, the Google affiliate Waymo. The statement, denying that Otto stole any of Google\u2019s intellectual property, was paraphrased from an internal company email; it was not a direct quotation from Mr. Levandowski.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Snap\u2019s I.P.O. Filing Reveals About the Company", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProspective investors will be drawn to how quickly Snap has grown its advertising business in roughly two years, with the company showing a nearly sevenfold increase between 2015 and last year. The question is how long the start-up can maintain anywhere close to that kind of growth.The company said in its prospectus that it views daily active users as a critical measure of engagement \u2014 a measure that is tracked closely by similar companies. (Facebook on Wednesday reported that it had an average of 1.23 billion daily active users in December.)We plan to continue to make acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, and seriously harm our business.As does every company in this kind of filing, Snap laid out a number of potential risks to its business. Among them is Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, what has come to be known as Brexit, which could pose large problems for the company because it recently designated London as its international hub.Snap noted that other countries may choose to censor Snapchat. Moreover, the company pointed out that many of Google\u2019s services, which power a significant portion of Snap\u2019s computer services, are restricted in China. So, according to Snap, it isn\u2019t clear \u201cif we will be able to enter the market in a manner acceptable to the Chinese government.\u201dThe company was originally built for users to send self-destructing photographs and messages to their friends. But the company\u2019s ambitions have grown to include user stories, news and branded content.(3) Amounts reported include 401(k) contributions and life insurance premiums paid by us on behalf of the named executive officer.(4) Amount reported includes $890,339 for security for Mr. Spiegel.(5) Amount reported includes (i) $328,747 for security for Mr. Spiegel and (ii) $15,766 for personal travel.(6) Mr. Sehn was not a named executive officer for the year ended December 31, 2015.Evan Spiegel, 26, one of Snap\u2019s two founders, started the company while he was a student at Stanford. Mr. Spiegel, who is the company\u2019s chief executive and serves on the board, owns a stake in the company that was worth $3.7 billion at the end of last year. His 2016 compensation package came to $2.6 million and included $503,205 in base salary, a $1 million bonus and $901,635 in other compensation that covered his $890,339 personal security budget.The company\u2019s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, received nearly $151 million during that same time, largely because of a $145 million stock award when he joined the company from the investment bank Credit Suisse in 2015.In August 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of 260,832 shares of Class B common stock from Mr. Horowitz, at a purchase price of $30.72 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million.A month before the company first filed initial public offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its two co-founders each sold stock worth $8.1 million.The company more than tripled its employee ranks from 2015 to 2016. Yet even with 1,859 staffers, the company has a relatively small number of workers relative to its valuation.The company has attracted a number of prominent backers, who are expected to reap handsome rewards \u2014 if only on paper \u2014 in the initial public offering. Among them are investment firms like Benchmark Capital, which owns about 13 percent of the company.Snap\u2019s offering is being led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley won the desired \u201clead left\u201d position on the prospectus, which indicates that it is the bank that will play the biggest role in the offering. The bank also led Facebook\u2019s initial public offering.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the size of the stake that Lightspeed Venture Partners has in Snap. It is 8.3 percent, not 6 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel Drops Its Sponsorship of Science Fairs, Prompting an Identity Crisis", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is apparently the thinking at Intel, the giant computer chip maker, which is retreating from its longtime sponsorship of science fairs for high school students.Intel\u2019s move away from traditional science fairs leads to broader questions about how a top technology company should handle the corporate sponsorship of science, and what is the best way to promote the education of the tech work force of the future. Intel\u2019s move also raises the issue of the role of science fairs in education in the so-called STEM fields \u2014 science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Intel has not explained its decision, and only said it is \u201cextremely proud\u201d of its long association with the two fairs. The company began supporting the national fair in 1998, taking over from the original sponsor, Westinghouse, and the global competition in 1997, which had no main sponsor.Still, Intel\u2019s move does not suggest a pullback by tech companies in their support for sponsoring science and technology. Google, for example, hosts the Google Science Fair, a global online competition for 13-to-18-year-olds that began in 2011.But as technology \u2014 and the economy \u2014 becomes more based on software, the major companies have broadened support to events like coding workshops and contests.It is hard to imagine a time since the post-Sputnik years when science and technology education has been more valued, by universities and in the labor market. It is also hard to imagine that the leading international science fair, whose roster of participating countries and territories rose to 78 last year, up from 27 in 1997, will not find a deep-pocketed sponsor.The Intel decision provoked a sharp difference of opinion between Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s current chief executive, and Craig R. Barrett, a former Intel chairman and chief executive.Mr. Krzanich has told colleagues privately that the science fairs were the fairs of the past and had become tilted to life sciences and biotechnology, not primary fields for Intel, according to two people who are not authorized to speak publicly for the company.Mr. Barrett disagreed. In an email, he said, \u201cyou might instead conclude that Intel is a company of the past, just like Westinghouse when they dropped\u201d sponsorship of the national science fair in 1998.Mr. Barrett, who is on the board of the Society for Science, also said that all of science has become data-driven and computational, so Intel has a stake in nurturing youthful innovators in all scientific disciplines, including the life sciences.Intel, under Mr. Krzanich, who became chief executive in 2013, has become a major supporter of Maker Faire events, where inventors of all ages showcase their homemade engineering projects. The first Maker Faire was in Silicon Valley in 2006. Last year, more than one million people attended Maker Faire events worldwide.Intel does support other programs to promote STEM education. In 2015, the company pledged $300 million to be spent by 2020 for a fund to diversify its own work force by attracting more women and minorities into technology and paying for college scholarships. Since 2001, the company has contributed an average of $45 million a year to university programs, including research collaborations and scholarships. And Intel is committed to supporting the International Science and Engineering Fair until 2019.Maya Ajmera, president of the Society for Science, praised Intel as \u201can extraordinary partner for the last 20 years,\u201d though she said the company never gave the society a reason for dropping the sponsorship.The society is looking for a sponsor for the international competition who will commit at least $15 million annually for a minimum of five years. It is an opportunity, Ms. Ajmera said, to \u201cinvest in the most important science and technology pipeline in the world.\u201dThe international science contest has a rich legacy. About 60 percent of the participants are American high school students, and its alumni include Paul L. Modrich, a Nobel Prize winner and biochemist at Duke University; Brian Greene, a physicist at Columbia University and a best-selling author; winners of the MacArthur Fellowship, also known as the \u201cgenius\u201d grant; and computer scientists at companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft.Science educators say that science fairs can nurture vital learning and life skills. Students must use critical thinking, experimentation, presentation and speaking skills, and persistence.Struck by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, Mr. Jerath designed an underwater wellhead capping device for taming a gusher and separating oil, gas and water for recycling. His creation won one of the top prizes at the international fair in Pittsburgh in 2015. He has applied for a patent and he has presented his idea to groups as varied as oil companies, the United Nations and young entrepreneur programs.His science fair success, he said, has \u201creally opened up so many doors for me that I had never thought of.\u201dWinning science-fair projects, she said, typically involve consulting mentors and judges, and bouncing ideas off others. That is particularly true of the final event, where 1,800 high school students from more than 70 nations gather to compete for the top prizes. Total student participation in the global competition remains steady, according to the Society for Science.\u201cThe positioning of these research competitions as science fairs can be misleading,\u201d he said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice Department Urges Appeals Court to Reinstate Trump\u2019s Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe administration\u2019s brief was the last in a series of urgent pleas to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which is now set to rule on the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency. The ruling will almost certainly be followed by an appeal to the Supreme Court.The court scheduled an hourlong oral argument for Tuesday. That gives at least another day of reprieve to foreign visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, as well as other immigrants, who initially were blocked from entering the United States by Mr. Trump\u2019s order.The administration\u2019s brief largely tracked its earlier arguments that dismissing the ban outright would threaten national security and disregard presidential authority. But it also asked the appeals court, at a minimum, to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u2014 appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government\u2019s case might not be successful.\u201cAt most,\u201d the brief said, the court order blocking the ban should be limited to \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\u201d That would allow the federal government to block people who have never visited the United States.On Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the administration stood ready to reinstate the entire ban. \u201cOnce we win the case, it will go right back into action,\u201d he said.Later on Monday night, Mr. Trump called threats \u201cfrom radical Islamic terrorism is very real.\u201d\u201cCourts must act fast!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation\u2019s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court. And none of the lower-court rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump.The Ninth Circuit scheduled the oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 3 p.m. Pacific time. It is to take place by telephone, and the court said it would be live-streamed on its website. Holding an oral argument by telephone in a major case is unusual.The case will be heard by Judge William C. Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush.Opponents of Mr. Trump\u2019s targeted travel ban made three kinds of arguments in their submissions to the appeals court, saying that the ban is unlawful, that it represents bad national-security policy, and that it is a threat to the nation\u2019s economy.Fifteen states and the District of Columbia \u2014 including New York, California, Massachusetts and Virginia \u2014 filed a supporting brief to argue that allowing the ban to stand would \u201ccause harm to the states, including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents.\u201dIn a brief filed Saturday, the Trump administration argued that Judge Robart\u2019s order would cause irreparable harm to national security.In response, lawyers for Washington and Minnesota said that was not plausible, because it would mean the nation had long been suffering \u201csome unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm.\u201d\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d the brief said. \u201cAs this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\u201dOn Monday, the Trump administration responded that the states were asking the courts \u201cto take the extraordinary step of second-guessing a formal national-security judgment made by the president himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority.\u201dThe states responded that \u201ccourts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants\u2019 true motives.\u201dThey added that the administration had taken \u201ca dizzying number of positions\u201d on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order itself appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it will not enforce that part of the order.Questions about permanent residents are not moot, the states\u2019 brief said, as the administration could again change positions.The officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama; Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton; Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser; and Leon E. Panetta, secretary of defense and director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama.Mr. Trump\u2019s order, the officials said, would endanger American troops and intelligence sources, disrupt counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts, damage the economy and have \u201ca devastating humanitarian impact.\u201d\u201cAnd apart from all of these concerns,\u201d the former officials said, \u201cthe order offends our nation\u2019s laws and values.\u201dThe third front in the legal battle against Mr. Trump\u2019s order was opened by the technology industry and other businesses.Almost 100 companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, urged the Ninth Circuit to continue to block the order, saying it \u201charms the competitiveness of U.S. companies.\u201dThe \u201cinstability and uncertainty\u201d created by the order, the brief said, \u201cwill make it far more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to hire some of the world\u2019s best talent \u2014 and impede them from competing in the global marketplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There\u2019s no doubt the company and its advisers were well aware that it would be forced to come out with a public statement if word of its approach to Unilever got out.If this had involved only American companies, probably nothing would have happened, as the companies could just decline to comment.In Britain, however, where shares of Unilever trade, it\u2019s different. The regulator of takeovers in Britain forces companies to announce the status of any acquisition as soon as rumors start. The idea is to ensure that the market has any notice of potential deal talks.The London market has long been known for deal leaks from bankers and other advisers and subsequent forced announcements. I practiced as a takeover lawyer in London for years, and one of the first documents lawyers produced when talks began was a potential leak announcement in anticipation of the inevitable leak.The premature exposure of the offer is not primarily what caused its collapse. Kraft Heinz would have been prepared for that. But it might not have expected the fierce blowback that followed news of the offer.For one thing, Unilever came out immediately and said not just no \u2014 but never.Writing responses to unsolicited approaches is an art. If a target company is willing to eventually contemplate a bid, the language it will use typically describes the offer price as grossly inadequate and the like.But Unilever\u2019s response went further. The company said the Kraft Heinz bid had \u201cno merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever\u2019s shareholders,\u201d and that accordingly there was no \u201cbasis for any further discussions.\u201dIf Unilever wanted to haggle only on price it would have left out the part about \u201cstrategic\u201d merit, which was simply another way of saying that the two were just not a good fit under any circumstances.Unilever\u2019s harsh response alone should not have been enough to send Kraft Heinz away. Unilever is a rare beast of a corporation: It is actually two corporations, known as a dual-listed company.Unilever was formed in 1929, when the British Lever Brothers company and the Dutch Margarine Unie decided to amalgamate. But they didn\u2019t actually combine, instead entering into contractual arrangements that made them effectively one company.Yet Unilever is technically two public companies: Unilever P.L.C., a British company listed on the London Stock Exchange and Unilever N.V., a Dutch company listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Both companies are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange for good measure.The two separate companies have entered into a series of complex contractual arrangements that allow for shareholders of each to be treated the same for all purposes, including takeovers and dividends. The reason for this byzantine structure is taxes. The dual listing allows the shareholders in each country to invest directly in a domestic company and receive domestic tax treatment on their shares.Kraft Heinz would have to take over both companies in an acquisition. Britain, which prohibits the use of merger defenses like the poison pill, would have been an easier country in which to mount a hostile takeover than the Netherlands, which allows such defenses.In the Netherlands, Unilever would have had to argue the merits of rejecting the offer. Given a sluggish stock price, it might have a hard time justifying its decision to shareholders, even though Dutch law allows the board to reject a takeover on strategic grounds or if it hurts other stakeholders, like employees.Still, the legal hurdles in the two countries would not have been high enough to thwart Kraft Heinz. But the political hurdles were more threatening.Unilever is one of the biggest companies on the London stock market, and British nationalism appears to be on the rise since Britons voted in June to leave the European Union.Kraft\u2019s recent history in Britain would also be likely to fan nationalist pride. Much bitterness remains over the company\u2019s $19 billion takeover of the British chocolate-maker Cadbury after it was accused of breaking promises to keep Cadbury factories open.This failed deal is just the first of many that will be tested in a new age of mercantilism. Countries that once hailed the merits of globalization and the free flow of capital and labor are now becoming much more protective of their big domestic companies, or what the French refer to as their \u201cnational champions.\u201dImagine what the response of President Trump would be if Apple or Google ever became a takeover target. Nationalism would be sure to prevail over any suspicion that Silicon Valley is not a friend of the president.Without any sign that Unilever might come around to accept an offer, Kraft Heinz probably did the math and realized it could never navigate the politics. A hostile takeover effort could have meant a scorched-earth political and public relations campaign that would most likely have damaged its brand.So Kraft Heinz had no choice but to fold. Under British rules, the company must now wait another six months before bidding again for Unilever. But I think one can assume that there will be no subsequent bid.Both companies are back to the drawing boards. Kraft Heinz will do the math on other targets where it can create value by cutting costs and increasing margins. Unilever, meanwhile, will also be looking for a strategic move to spur growth. This could mean spinning off its food business.It is uncertain what the next steps will be for Kraft Heinz and Unilever, but their brief encounter is a clear warning sign for international deals to come. As countries become more protective of borders and their national interests, it will become harder for giant corporations to stretch across those borders without fear of a political backlash.While there is an argument to be made to limit the creation of these behemoths since they have too much power, cutting them off for nationalistic purposes is troublesome. It will lead to more inefficient national champions, protected by their countries. Unilever was Exhibit A \u2014 a sluggish giant in need of some slimming and efficiency.This type of protectionism has not worked well in countries like France, where Danone, the yogurt maker, has been protected as a national champion and slow growth has been the norm. It probably won\u2019t work well elsewhere.But the problem is likely only to get worse. A new age of political protectionism has become the latest quandary for large corporations.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "How Kevin Durant Became Silicon Valley\u2019s Hottest Start-up", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven so, every article on Mr. Durant seemed to boil down to this: He was too nice. And super-duper-stars aren\u2019t \u201cnice.\u201dThat narrative persisted until last June, when Mr. Durant, who had spent eight years dutifully toiling in small-market Oklahoma City for the Thunder, became one of the most heavily courted free agents in league history. The bidding war for his services was like a sports-world variation of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201dBut the funny thing about being in the eye of the hurricane? It\u2019s surprisingly calm there.Here is a look at Mr. Durant\u2019s life in the Bay Area over a recent two-day stretch between big wins against the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Thunder, as he made the rounds as arguably the hottest start-up in Silicon Valley.It was early afternoon on an unseasonably warm winter Tuesday, and Mr. Durant was in high spirits, barreling down the Bayshore Freeway in a black Cadillac Escalade on the way to a speaking engagement at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif.That morning, Mr. Durant was the centerpiece a lavish groundbreaking ceremony for the Chase Center, the $1 billion pleasure dome on the San Francisco waterfront that the team plans to occupy by 2019.With his six-foot-infinity frame and impossibly long legs, Mr. Durant seemed to swallow a yard of real estate with each stride. As an eight-time N.B.A. All-Star seemingly dressed for Pitti Uomo (he wore a blue custom suit, a striped pocket square and white Common Projects sneakers), Mr. Durant certainly stood out in the wood-beam suburban sports bar where a number of diners were decked out in blue-and-gold Warriors gear.Mr. Durant is comfortable with the level of scrutiny he receives in the Bay Area, meaning, not too much. \u201cHey, it\u2019s not L.A., it\u2019s not New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere in between.\u201dAlthough he has appeared on magazine covers for a decade, he still carries himself like a teenager. He slouched in the booth with his shoulders slumped, face buried in his iPhone before the food arrived.Once the conversation did start, however, Mr. Durant sounded pensive, introspective. Unlike many M.V.P.-caliber athletes who seem to field every question seemingly looking for the quickest exit strategy, Mr. Durant paused to consider each question, and he seemed unafraid to open up, despite his natural shyness.\u201cI didn\u2019t really have friends,\u201d Mr. Durant said of his childhood in Seat Pleasant, Md., which neighbors Washington. \u201cI was quiet. I was awkward-sized.\u201dRaised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood, Mr. Durant said he \u201cdidn\u2019t look the part\u201d of a cool kid, adding that, \u201cIt made it easy for me to not worry about the social life and just play basketball.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the gift and the curse of being an athlete that is so dedicated at an early age, you forget about real life sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just in the last few years starting to feel comfortable to meet new people, going out in groups, meeting new girls, hanging out. That stuff was foreign to me until a few years back.\u201dNear the end of the lunch, a petite woman in a Warriors jersey trailing two eager children approached the booth. \u201cExcuse me, Kevin?\u201d she asked diffidently. But a man in his security detail whisked her away before he could respond.Upon leaving the booth, however, Mr. Durant demonstrated his growing ease with fame among his adopted family of Warriors fans, making a beeline toward the woman\u2019s table to graciously pose for selfies with the family.\u201cThey can feel how much heat that I got from coming here,\u201d he said of his controversial move to Bay Area. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make me feel at peace.\u201dFifteen minutes later, the Escalade pulled into a parking garage beneath the sprawling YouTube campus. Mr. Durant had no time for a plunge down the office\u2019s 45-foot-long red slide, sink a 10-footer on the indoor putting green or grab a quick snooze in a Kubrickian, white-plastic \u201cnap pod.\u201d After all, he was the employee perk that day.He proceeded to an auditorium that was filled to capacity with YouTube employees, some of them looking barely old enough to vote, let alone drink, and took a seat onstage across from Neal Mohan, YouTube\u2019s chief product officer, who was moderating an employees-only question-and-answer session that was live-streamed to YouTube and Google offices around the world.Flashing a $59,000 Vacheron Constantin watch, Mr. Durant did not exactly fit the profile of the skinny-armed tech programmer. But he cast himself as just another member of the YouTube generation, talking about his obsession with Grand Theft Auto V, hip-hop and, of course, YouTube. \u201cI\u2019m sure you guys know, you want to look at one quick video and it turns into four or five hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dangerous, that app.\u201dWhen an audience member asked if he planned to try acting, like the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Blake Griffin or the Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James, Mr. Durant snorted sarcastically, \u201cIf anybody could do it, it\u2019s Blake Griffin and LeBron.\u201d The audience erupted in laughter, since both players are considered Oscar-worthy on-court floppers. Mr. Durant, holding back a chuckle, insisted that he was talking about their impressive work in commercials and movies.In a sense, Mr. Durant is not wholly unlike the legions of ambitious 20-somethings in hoodies and cool sneakers who descend on Silicon Valley to make hundreds of millions.The only difference is, he has already made hundreds of millions.The next day, Mr. Durant was piloting his black Tesla Model S up a windy road in the Oakland Hills, after the Warriors\u2019 morning shootaround. It was around noon on game day, the second meeting of the season with his former team, the Thunder. He seemed more distant that day, his voice quieter, raspier.Dressed in a gray Warriors hoodie, he steered into a hilltop cul-de-sac and pulled into a driveway of his sleek contemporary-style house, where he hopped out, plugged in the Tesla, and headed into the house through a garage where his black labradoodle Ro was resting peacefully.As his private chef hunched over the stove, preparing a game-day pasta meal, Mr. Durant slumped into the world\u2019s longest sectional sofa and stared out the soaring windows, which were rattling from the wind, toward downtown Oakland in the distance. He chose the house for the view.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to be on top of everything, see it from a different perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was at the bottom growing up.\u201dMr. Durant has been living in the 10,000-square-foot rental for only a few months, and as a bachelor who spends half his time on the road, it has a temporary feel to it. The white lilies on the kitchen table were silk, the fiddle-leaf fig plant in the corner of the family room was plastic.Still, it was decorated in a style that might be called Sports Superstar Moderne: the stark white walls are festooned with abstract Expressionist artwork, with ample trophies on display. The house has a home recording studio, a recreation room littered with Washington Redskins memorabilia, a movie theater that seats 16, and a walk-in closet devoted to sneakers.Mr. Durant padded barefoot past his hangar-size master bedroom, into another vast closet where he keeps his custom suits, jewelry and watches. The real treasure there, however, was his swelling collection of vintage concert T-shirts from the 1980s and \u201990s \u2014 Nas, Biggie, Metallica, Stone Cold Steve Austin. \u201cI take pride in my collection,\u201d he said.But what\u2019s the point of looking runway-ready in a culture where Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s sweatshirt sets the tone? Mr. Durant feels more at home in the Silicon Valley-approved wardrobe of jeans, sneakers and hoodies.\u201cFashion,\u201d he said, \u201cis what you make of it.\u201dBack in the family room, Mr. Durant paused in front of his frame wall containing a moody black-and-white photograph showing three clenched fists, each with a small triangle tattoo at the base of the thumb. One fist was Mr. Durant\u2019s, another belongs to Charlie Bell, a childhood friend who is now a top executive at Jay Z\u2019s agency, Roc Nation, and third to Mr. Kleiman, who still represents Mr. Durant through Jay Z\u2019s Roc Nation Sports and is also working for him directly as his manager and partner in the Durant Company.The photo is a reminder to himself about real friendship, Mr. Durant said. His social world had shrunken since his controversial move.\u201cWhen you make it to the league, especially from where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s like everybody made it,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cI can remember times going to a club, I had 30 people with me. I\u2019m thinking to myself, this was never me. But if you\u2019ve never had the support outwardly like that, people showing you affection in your face, love in your face, even if it\u2019s fake, you try to grab that because it feels good for the moment.\u201cNow, it\u2019s us three.\u201dHe may be rounding the math a little bit. Mr. Durant may have called off his engagement with Monica Wright, a W.N.B.A. player, and dialed back the entourage, but he goes out often after games in San Francisco and is quickly making friends with the tech titans who populate Oracle Arena\u2019s version of celebrity row.In September, he celebrated his birthday at a lavish barbecue at the house of Ben Horowitz, the influential venture capitalist and business partner of Marc Andreessen. Two months later, he watched the election results at the home of Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services, along with Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, and Pharrell Williams.\u201cI think that\u2019s why a lot of athletes and entertainers work well with some of those guys, because for one, they all had humble beginnings,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cThey built something from the ground up, so they can relate to us.\u201dMinutes before he was ready to settle down for his 2 p.m. nap, Mr. Durant headed to the real sanctuary in his Oakland home, the recording studio.\u201cMan, why you all keep it so cold in here?\u201d he asked Raleigh Dunn, his recording engineer, while taking a seat in the corner. The lights turned low, Mr. Dunn prepared a sample of the Chi-Lites \u201cHave You Seen Her\u201d for Mr. Durant to lay rhymes over. While some might call Mr. Dunn a \u201cproducer,\u201d Mr. Durant has a different name for him: music therapist.\u201cI\u2019ve got so much stuff on my mind, quite honestly, it\u2019s kind of easy for me to say it all here,\u201d Mr. Durant said, looking almost monastic with his goateed face hidden in the hood of his sweatshirt. Music, he said, is \u201ca release. It keeps me in the moment. It takes my mind off this crazy world.\u201dBut at the moment, Mr. Durant would only say that latest rhymes were about \u201crelationship things, both with male friends, females, relationships that might have been broken on both sides.\u201dThat\u2019s the beauty of music. Once you put it down on tape, he said, all the nagging issues \u201care just out of my mind. I can move on to the next thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Little Birdie Told Me: Playing the Market on Trump Tweets", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Analyzing Twitter for market-moving information has been a business for years. High-frequency trading firms have even built such analysis into their trading strategies.A month into Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, the best algorithmic minds on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are still scrambling to come to grips with the phenomenon.\u201cTrump\u2019s tweeting habits seem to be as erratic as everything else about him,\u201d Max Braun, an employee of the Google-affiliated research laboratory known as X, said in a recent interview.Mr. Braun has built an automated bot \u2014 Trump2Cash \u2014 that analyzes Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and then automatically places a trade on the companies the president names.But like others in his field, Mr. Braun has learned that Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior on social media does not always play out the way the science would predict.The science of trading based on Twitter predates President Trump.Yet the president \u201cis a volatility machine,\u201d said Joe Gits, the chief executive of Social Market Analytics, which produces automated analysis of social media for professional investors. \u201cHe generates more volatility than anything in the world right now, so these stocks are going to move one way or the other.\u201dMr. Gits noted that in the long run \u2014 or even within a few weeks \u2014 almost all the companies that have been hit by Mr. Trump\u2019s jabs appeared to have recovered from the damage, suggesting that investors are discounting Mr. Trump\u2019s resolve to act against the companies.But Mr. Gits said that any firm doing short-term trading had to take Mr. Trump\u2019s statements into account. It has not been easy.That complicated response is, in part, a result of the fact that professional traders are not the only ones trying to play the Trump markets \u2014 tens of thousands of armchair investors are watching the president\u2019s account and placing trades.Rachel Mayer is the co-founder of a New York start-up, Trigger Finance, that creates automatic trading triggers for small-time investors, based on real-world events. The company has created triggers for all sorts of market-moving signals \u2014 like changes in Federal Reserve policy and big stock price moves \u2014 but the triggers that Ms. Mayer\u2019s company has built around Trump\u2019s Twitter account have been by far the most popular, gaining 10,000 subscribers.Ms. Mayer, who used to be a currency trader at JPMorgan Chase, said there were a number of indications that many of her subscribers saw the tweet about Nordstrom and decided to buy the stock as a form of protest, just as many consumers said they would support the store after the president\u2019s attack.Ms. Mayer said that over time the market responses to Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamations seemed to be more restrained, which may reflect a recognition that the president\u2019s bark is worse than his bite.\u201cThe market doesn\u2019t seem to think that he\u2019s going to do anything else except complain,\u201d she said.Trump2Cash, Mr. Braun\u2019s bot, is set to hold the stock only until the end of the same trading day as the tweet. If the sentiment is negative, it places a short sale, or a bet that the price will fall, to take advantage of the stock going down.Mr. Braun has continually tweaked the rules governing Trump2Cash. He has, for instance, programmed the bot to ignore mentions of media companies, including The New York Times Company, because they amounted to more market noise than signal.But Mr. Braun says he will not mind if the bot ends up losing money \u2014 he is thinking about Trump2Cash as more of an art project than an investing strategy, and he plans to donate any money he makes from the few thousand dollars he has invested to Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, as a rebuke to Mr. Trump\u2019s politics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Decide Which Headphones to Buy (Hint: Not Apple\u2019s AirPods)", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsk The WirecutterThere are so many choices for earphones and earbuds. How do I decide what to buy?What do you use?Because of my job, I get to know the perfect headphone for every situation. I think I regularly rotate among seven pairs.I always spend a week using any potential top pick before we post a review so I can troubleshoot. I\u2019ve caught a few problems that way. And yes, I\u2019ve even done that with the kids\u2019 headphones. I have a surprisingly small hat size.Why aren\u2019t the new Apple cordless earbuds on the list?Do headphones and earbuds really have to cost so much?Some technology, like a Bluetooth antenna or an active noise-canceling circuit, is going to cost a manufacturer a certain amount for the components and licensing fees. A manufacturer can\u2019t get them into a product for any less. That sets a base manufacturing cost. So a good pair of in-ear sport Bluetooth headphones, a solid product that will last you a few years, costs about $99.Anything below that will likely suffer in some way. To some people, that\u2019s O.K. But you can\u2019t expect magic for $30. On the other end, when you\u2019re paying over $300, you are getting a combination of innovation, product quality and sound quality. But a lot of times, anything much above that, it\u2019s just plain old marketing and hype.Are you thinking of any particular headphones?In the audio quality category, there\u2019s the planar magnetic Oppo, Audeze, Mr. Speakers, brands like that. They range from $400 and up. Bose has the best active-noise-canceling technology available, and it\u2019s because the company spent a ton of money on research and development. And of course, Beats has the market cornered on branding. They\u2019ve been making a lot of improvements to their sound quality. But the difference between them and others priced that high is that you\u2019re paying $150 to $200 for sound and adding on another $100 or so for the Beats label.What\u2019s your dream product?There\u2019s the elusive unicorn: headphones that do everything well and work in any situation. That could be possible with what\u2019s available to purchase today, but nobody has made it just yet.But I\u2019m also really fascinated with where companies like Bragi and Here One are going with \u201chearables.\u201d Those are devices that are computers worn in your ears \u2014 like what Google Glass was trying to do with vision, but in your ears instead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: A Letter From Zuckerberg and the Fall of PewDiePie", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsMaybe I should start using bronzer?Anyway, his essay was quite a heave to read, so I\u2019ll give everyone the CliffsNotes version: Connecting people is great, Facebook isn\u2019t the government but kind of wants to help create new forms of governance, and also here are a bunch of ideals and half-cemented plans that we may roll out some time in the future. Make sense to you?I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that this is as close as we\u2019ve come to seeing Mark give some sort of political statement in a rather charged environment. Even his company\u2019s mission \u2014 to connect the world \u2014 is now a polarizing idea.One could argue that deep currents of isolationism have run throughout nations over the history of mankind. And as many Trump supporters would argue, there are reasons for borders, even far before the internet ever existed.I think a lot of this depends on whether you buy into the idea that Facebook can ultimately be a uniting force for good in the world, or whether you think it will end up further polarizing us.So if you\u2019re over the age of 18, you may not actually know who PewDiePie is. In a nutshell: He is Felix Kjellberg, one of the world\u2019s most popular video game live-streamers on the internet. He\u2019s amassed an enormous following on YouTube, where he essentially films himself playing video games and talking to the camera. I\u2019ve watched him before \u2014 for the entire length of him beating a video game \u2014 and it\u2019s actually captivating and somewhat intimate, like he\u2019s having an extended discussion with you. He\u2019s made millions of dollars doing it, too.Kjellberg maintains they were off-color jokes that went too far. But that didn\u2019t stop Disney and YouTube from severing ties with the guy, cutting short his multimillion-dollar contracts.So I\u2019m curious. What do you think this episode says about online gamer culture? A ton of folks are coming to Kjellberg\u2019s aid after this whole thing, saying that The Journal has blown the whole thing out of proportion. Do you buy that?The bigger question for me is how the big sponsors of these stars of tomorrow \u2014 companies like Google and Disney \u2014 change how they vet people like PewDiePie. Tomorrow\u2019s celebrities are going to come from the internet culture. To older folks running these media companies, internet celebs are going to look and sound totally off the wall, but the execs are going to feel pressure to sign them based on their huge popularity. It seems clear no one at Disney was actually paying attention to PewDiePie \u2014 the Nazi stuff was out there for everyone to see, and Disney responded only once The Journal came calling. So perhaps that will be the first fix here: actually paying attention to the internet celebs you\u2019ve paid so handsomely.Anyway, that\u2019s enough from me. I\u2019m going to start my own streaming channel starring my dog.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Liberal Activists Join Forces Against a Common Foe: Trump", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Justin Boyan worried about the effects of climate change but focused on his wife, his two daughters and his work as a computer scientist in Rhode Island. Then Donald J. Trump became president, and Mr. Boyan was jolted into political activism.Within days of the election, Mr. Boyan began volunteering for the Working Families Party, a liberal political organization focused on income inequality, and attended almost weekly protests to voice his dismay. He traveled to the Women\u2019s March on Washington with his family the day after inauguration, protested Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban at the Rhode Island state capital, and began studying criminal justice issues, which he connects to climate change as two issues where policy makers, he believes, have put the demands of big-money contributors over the needs of ordinary people.The same energy motivating Mr. Boyan is bursting out at demonstrations and town hall meetings across the country. Protesters who had focused on issues like police shootings of black people, a $15 minimum wage and climate change are collaborating against a common foe, President Trump. In cities and states, activists are exchanging civil disobedience tactics, pooling financial resources and showing up to demonstrations about issues that they may not have previously focused on.Call it Protest Nation: Activists across the country have been strengthening old partnerships and making new ones.In New York, organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington last month made sure to address a broad range of issues, including abortion rights and access to contraception, racism, immigration laws and demands for pay parity between men and women. In Charlotte, N.C., on the weekend that the travel ban went into effect, African-American activists accustomed to blasting out information about police shootings sent a mass text message asking people to gather at an airport to support travelers from Muslim-majority countries.In Chicago, a group focused on racial discrimination has teamed up with one focused on Latinos to push a new initiative aimed at expanding both the number and the definition of sanctuary cities to protect undocumented immigrants and curb police brutality.\u201cI was on the phone arranging a car pool to violin practice and I said: \u2018All right, I\u2019ll be there in 20 minutes. Bye.\u2019 And the mom said, \u2018Resist,\u2019\u201d Mr. Boyan, 46, marveled about a recent conversation. \u201cWhen people say goodbye to each other, they are saying, \u2018Resist.\u2019\u201dFor opponents of Mr. Trump, there is a risk protesting a president who revels in opposition, mocks demonstrators and says he speaks for a silent majority, said Micah White, 34, of Nehalem, Ore., who helped start Occupy Wall Street in 2011. That movement prompted thousands to camp in public parks, protest the excesses of \u201cthe 1 percent\u201d \u2014 and eventually disperse with little to show for the efforts.\u201cDonald Trump is a master of stagecraft, and he\u2019s obsessed with ratings,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cSo large-scale protests, they are just part of the spectacle game. They draw more attention to him. They help him feel like he is the center of the universe. And until there is a social protest movement that is ready and willing to take power and govern, then protests will always be ineffective.\u201dActivists opposing Mr. Trump still see strength in mass action, and they have begun broadening their reach.Since she helped organize the Women\u2019s March on Washington, which drew hundreds of thousands of people, Tamika D. Mallory, a gun control advocate and one of the march\u2019s four co-chairwomen, has protested against the travel ban, spoken out against Attorney General Jeff Sessions and worked on organizing follow-up events to keep people involved after the march. She said that while she was still focused on racism and the lives of black people, she also understood that Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid-fire pace meant people must work together and learn about issues outside their main concerns.\u201cThis is the moment for us to show up for one another and to show up as concerned Americans versus being sort of stuck in our silos,\u201d Ms. Mallory, 36, said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before a different community is under attack.\u201d\u201cThe playbook has changed,\u201d she added.Two weeks ago, when thousands of people protested the travel ban at airports across the country, Nelini Stamp, national membership director of the Working Families Party, said she could sense the coalescing of a national protest movement. Messages to gather at Kennedy International Airport in New York came through texts, emails and Facebook posts across a spectrum of interest areas. Ms. Stamp, who several years ago got involved in organizing through Occupy Wall Street, said that by the time she got to the airport it felt like a family reunion.\u201cI saw folks that I worked with on labor issues, folks that I had worked with on the street, folks I\u2019ve been arrested with doing civil disobedience,\u201d she said. \u201cA community of folks just merged, and it felt like magnets drawing to each other.\u201d\u201cAs organizers we already understand the value of relationships, and as organizers we also understand the urgency of this particular moment,\u201d said Charlene Carruthers, 31, national director of Black Youth Project 100.Tania A. Unzueta, 33, policy and legal director of Mijente, said she saw the collaboration as crucial for undocumented immigrants like herself and to minority communities where discrimination can have deadly consequences.\u201cWe really do think our survival depends on being able to find collective strength,\u201d said Ms. Unzueta, who came to the United States from Mexico at 10. \u201cThey are attacking our communities in different ways, and I think there are ways that our communities may be pitted against each other.\u201dLast month, Jimmy Dahman, 25, and about 100 volunteers from across the country started a push called Town Hall Project 2018. Through a publicly accessible Google spreadsheet, the group is listing dozens of town-hall-style meetings being held by members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Dahman, who worked as an organizer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, said he wanted to make it easier for people to have face-to-face interactions with elected officials.\u201cWe have volunteers who are particularly upset about the prospect of climate change regulations being rolled back,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are folks who are very nervous that they or someone they know and love may lose their health care. There are folks who are upset about the Muslim ban and some of the travel bans that the administration has put in place. They are all fired up for different reasons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bathroom Case Puts Transgender Student on National Stage", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The bespectacled teenager in the gray A.C.L.U. hoodie and cargo pants stood, back pressed against a chain-link fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, under a sign saying \u201cNo Trespassing, Authorized Personnel Only.\u201d The White House, illuminated at night, cast a glow over well-wishers who, having just wrapped up a protest against President Trump, waited in line to pay homage to 17-year-old Gavin Grimm.Mr. Grimm looked a little flustered. \u201cAbsolutely humbled,\u201d he pronounced himself, as his admirers thanked him for being brave.Mr. Trump has portrayed the issue as one of states\u2019 rights, and already the country\u2019s transgender students face differing realities depending on their school. Some are restricted to the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. Others are not. Then there are the students like Mr. Grimm, who have had separate facilities set aside for them.At issue in Mr. Grimm\u2019s case is whether Title IX, a provision in a 1972 law that bans discrimination \u201con the basis of sex\u201d in schools that receive federal money, also bans discrimination based on gender identity. President Barack Obama concluded that it did. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s action, lawyers for both Mr. Grimm and the school board said Thursday that they expected the case to go forward, with oral arguments set for March 28 and school officials across the country awaiting the result.For Mr. Grimm, who said he knew he was a boy \u201cas soon as I was aware of the difference between boys and girls,\u201d the case amounts to a crash course in government and media relations. It bears his initials, G.G., because he is a minor, and the name of his mother, Deirdre.At home in rural Gloucester, he is a kid with a pet pig named Esmeralda, a geek\u2019s love of Pok\u00e9mon cards and 600-plus Facebook friends. He wears $12 sneakers from Walmart and likes eating at Fuddruckers because the name sounds funny. He is applying for college, but doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.At the protest here Wednesday night, he was the star speaker, besieged with teary hugs and cellphone selfies. The mother of a transgender child burst into tears when she saw him. A government lawyer shook his hand. Activists posed for pictures.Mr. Grimm looked awe-struck at the thought. \u201cI just hope I do it justice,\u201d he said quietly.When Mr. Grimm was about 12 or 13, he said, he was able to put a name to what he was feeling and recognized himself as transgender. He came out first to his friends, which was easier than telling his parents.For the family, it was a jolt, his mother said. It made her question preachers \u2014 she eventually left her church \u2014 but strengthened her faith.\u201cGod gave me this child to open my heart and my mind,\u201d Mrs. Grimm, a nurse, said.In 2014, when Mr. Grimm was 15 and starting his sophomore year, the family told his school he was transgender. Administrators were supportive at first and allowed him to use the boys\u2019 bathroom.But amid an uproar from some parents and students, and after two tense school board meetings, the board barred Mr. Grimm from using the boys\u2019 bathrooms and instead adopted a policy requiring transgender youth to use separate \u201csingle user\u201d restrooms. The school now has three such restrooms, but two are in refurbished utility closets, said Mr. Block, the A.C.L.U. lawyer.Kyle Duncan, a lawyer for the school board, said the board \u201cagonized\u201d as it sought a thoughtful way to accommodate Mr. Grimm while protecting students who felt uncomfortable. \u201cThis is a sensitive and difficult issue in which everyone\u2019s privacy rights need to be respected,\u201d he said.But Mr. Block said that Mr. Grimm had been singled out for \u201cclassic sex discrimination.\u201dMrs. Grimm was more pointed: \u201cThis school board has targeted my child.\u201dHer son did not always have such aplomb. Before he began \u201cliving authentically,\u201d his mother said, he was introverted, often retreating to his room. She winces at the times she tried to curl his hair and make him wear dresses.Mr. Grimm is, by all accounts, the perfect plaintiff, poised beyond his years. He knows how to deflect unwanted lines of questioning (he will not talk about his twin brother, friends or teachers) and is unfailingly polite in replying to intimate queries about his bathroom habits (\u201cIf I have to go, I go to the nurse\u2019s restroom,\u201d he told a local television reporter on Wednesday night) and his emotions (\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating, it\u2019s embarrassing, it\u2019s very uncomfortable. I have this neon sign above my head that says I\u2019m different from my peers\u201d).But at heart, he is still a kid. Once, while touring the National Archives here, Mr. Grimm excitedly played Pok\u00e9mon Go in front of the Declaration of Independence, as Bill Farrar, a spokesman for the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Virginia affiliate, patiently tried to remind him that he was probably \u201cthe only person here who has a legal proceeding before the Supreme Court.\u201dThe two have bonded over hours of travel, including a dash from Gloucester to Washington on Wednesday. Mr. Grimm stuffed his belongings in a white trash bag, sticking in a dress shirt at the last minute, which proved handy for \u201cThe View.\u201dAnd with just eight justices on the court \u2014 confirmation hearings for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for the ninth seat, are scheduled to begin March 20 \u2014 the justices might be inclined to wait.But Vanita Gupta, who ran the Civil Rights Division in Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department and helped write the directive that Mr. Trump rescinded, said the Grimm case had already advanced the cause of transgender rights, just by raising awareness.\u201cThere has been such social and cultural change in the hearts and minds of people in this country,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s only going to grow, even if there is a legal setback.\u201dWhatever happens, Mr. Grimm appears destined for a life of advocacy. He says he feels a heavy burden standing up for other transgender people, knowing that everyone is different. He worries that other young people will not have the support that he has had.While he is not much on school (he is taking only the two courses he needs to graduate), he would like to be a geneticist. He wants to know how the brain works.But asking him about his career plans brings a Gavin-like answer \u2014 wry and pointed.\u201cI want to be,\u201d he said, \u201csomeone who doesn\u2019t have to talk about where he is going to use the bathroom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Sense of Dread\u2019 for Civil Servants Shaken by Trump Transition", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Across the vast federal bureaucracy, Donald J. Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House has spread anxiety, frustration, fear and resistance among many of the two million nonpolitical civil servants who say they work for the public, not a particular president.At the Environmental Protection Agency, a group of scientists strategized this past week about how to slow-walk President Trump\u2019s environmental orders without being fired.At the Treasury Department, civil servants are quietly gathering information about whistle-blower protections as they polish their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.At the United States Digital Service \u2014 the youthful cadre of employees who left jobs at Google, Facebook or Microsoft to join the Obama administration \u2014 workers are debating how to stop Mr. Trump should he want to use the databases they made more efficient to target specific immigrant groups.The New York Times would like to hear from President Trump\u2019s supporters: What do you think about his policies so far?\u201cIt\u2019s almost a sense of dread, as in, what will happen to us,\u201d said Gabrielle Martin, a trial lawyer and 30-year veteran at the Denver office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where colleagues now share daily, grim predictions about the fate of their jobs under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201cIt\u2019s like the movie music when the shark is coming,\u201d Ms. Martin said, referring to \u201cJaws,\u201d the 1975 thriller. \u201cPeople are just wary \u2014 is the shark going to come up out of the water?\u201dThis article is based on interviews around the country with more than three dozen current and recently departed federal employees from the Internal Revenue Service; the Pentagon; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Justice and Treasury Departments; the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development; and other parts of the government. They reveal a federal work force that is more fundamentally shaken than usual by the uncertainties that follow a presidential transition from one party to the other.Federal workers are more likely to be Democrats, according to surveys. But partisanship and ideology explain only some of the intense feelings among workers, many of whom have seen Democrats and Republicans in the White House come and go.At bars after work, in employee break rooms, on conference calls and on social media networks, employees at agencies targeted for steep reductions fear for their jobs. They worry about Mr. Trump\u2019s freeze on hiring and regulations, his pledge to reverse environmental protections, and his executive order shutting down immigration for refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.Some federal workers welcome Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to create new jobs, build infrastructure and lower taxes. Others say they are focusing on doing their jobs and trying not to be distracted by the political noise that surrounds them. Still others say they are struggling with the question of whether they want to work for a president with whom they so strongly disagree.\u201cWhat do you do,\u201d asked Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, if you work at a place where the leader \u201cavowedly renounces the work of that agency?\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden, you are faced with a real moral dilemma,\u201d continued Mr. Connolly, whose district just outside Washington is home to thousands of federal workers.Federal workers watched with growing alarm last year as Mr. Trump waged a campaign filled with antigovernment bombast and then during a transition in which he recruited cabinet secretaries hostile to the agencies they lead. Now they wait in these chaotic early days of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency as he and his political advisers use executive orders to shred the policies and traditions the workers have championed.The intensity of feeling was already raw in late December, when members of the Digital Service gathered for drinks at the Laughing Man Tavern, a Washington bar, to say goodbye to Mikey Dickerson, their boss and the Google engineer first hired to rescue HealthCare.gov, the government\u2019s Affordable Care Act website.Mr. Dickerson had recruited many of them to overhaul outdated government systems and databases, with the goal of helping President Barack Obama open the country\u2019s doors to refugees, protect immigrants, aid veterans and improve health care. Now, he said, those who choose to stay will be building better tools for the agenda of Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is a crisis moment,\u201d Mr. Dickerson told his staff that night, according to a rough transcript of his remarks. \u201cThe coalition that brought us all together for a while is broken, because the values that we have all prioritized differently are now pointing in different directions.\u201dFour days after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers \u2014 Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell \u2014 attended the Digital Service\u2019s staff meeting. The pair, who are close to Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, told the nearly 100 staff members that their expertise was valued by the president; Mr. Kushner; Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist; and others in the West Wing.The message was meant to provide reassurance. But several members of the team said it had the opposite effect. One employee who still works there said it was the moment she realized their combined technological prowess would be harnessed for a new purpose.\u201cAt that moment, when folks heard the name Steve Bannon, it was like a punch in the gut. It became so real,\u201d said the employee, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.Career employees are particularly nervous at the E.P.A., which Mr. Trump repeatedly singled out for attack on the campaign trail, vowing at one point to \u201cget rid of\u201d the agency. On Monday, about 100 employees at the agency\u2019s Chicago office, which oversees the enforcement of environmental regulations in five Midwestern states, used their lunch hour to protest the Senate\u2019s confirmation of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the agency. Mr. Pruitt was a fierce critic of its mission under Mr. Obama.\u201cI have been through several transitions, but I have never had or seen this level of alarm,\u201d said Nicole Cantello, an E.P.A. lawyer in the Chicago office, who heads the Chicago-area union of the agency\u2019s employees.Ms. Cantello, who has worked for the E.P.A. prosecuting cases since 1990, said that during the George W. Bush administration, some career employees had quietly bristled at more industry-friendly environmental regulations. But at no point did they feel the alarm they do now, she said.\u201cUnless there\u2019s an abject abandoning of E.P.A.\u2019s role in the world, we\u2019ll do what we\u2019re told to do,\u201d she said.In a video to E.P.A. employees this past week, the acting administrator, Catherine R. McCabe, acknowledged that \u201cmany of you are concerned about\u201d reports that climate change data had been removed from the department\u2019s websites.\u201cI would like to allay the fears and rumors that scientific data and information are being deleted,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not the case.\u201dDespite such reassurances, the concerns of federal employees are being spread across social media, on accounts with names like \u201c@Rogue_DOD,\u201d \u201c@Alt_DeptofEd\u201d and \u201c@AngryWHStaffer.\u201d One anonymous Twitter user created \u201c@WhitehouseLeaks,\u201d with a purported mission to reveal the secret workings of the Trump administration from within the West Wing.Many federal employees recoiled at reports that the president was about to issue an executive order rolling back certain rights for lesbians, gays and transgender people.\u201cThere was a group of people who were planning some public display of protest with the purpose of leaving,\u201d a federal employee in Washington said. Another official, who worked at Treasury until this past week, said his friends would have considered that order \u201cthe last straw\u201d and most likely would have quit. The president did not issue such an order.More than 1,000 State Department diplomats registered their opposition to the ban by signing a dissent letter asserting that the new policy would \u201crun counter to core American values\u201d and would not make the country safer.At the Defense Department, where uniformed men and women work with civilians, several rank-and-file employees expressed outrage that Mr. Trump would announce the travel ban at the Pentagon, a building filled with people from different faiths and countries. That same day, the Defense Department posted a message on Twitter about a former refugee who became a Marine. \u201cFrom refugee to #Marine. @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes his fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out,\u201d it read.Helene Cooper, Coral Davenport and Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
