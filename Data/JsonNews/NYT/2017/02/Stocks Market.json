{"Headline": "How to Take a Cosmic View on a Trump Stock Market", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe Trump stock market rally has displayed formidable staying power, yet there are reasons to be uneasy.The potential troubles are not bubbling up from the economy or from the market itself, but from the world of politics. That raises ticklish questions for the millions of people who rely on the stock market to secure their retirement, buy a home or educate their children.After all, history shows that stocks have provided the best returns of all publicly available asset classes over long periods, and the conventional wisdom is that they will continue to do so, regardless of transitory things like presidential elections or even wars and recessions.Yet Mr. Trump is making many people nervous. \u201cThe risks are rising fast,\u201d Brad McMillan, the chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Mass., wrote in late January. \u201cPolitics remains the focus here, not economics.\u201dThere are plenty of political controversies at the moment. Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on immigration, oil, financial deregulation, Mexico, NATO, Russia, China and Australia have all set off furors. Take your pick. Let\u2019s just assume that you are concerned \u2014 and wondering whether your money is safe.Based on the long history of the stock market, it\u2019s possible to conclude that Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior in office doesn\u2019t matter. This requires a cosmic perspective, however, and assumes that history will be relevant in the future.For a truly long-term investor, the overall stock market actually hasn\u2019t been all that risky since 1926. But that statement is reasonable only with some very important caveats. You must have held a diversified portfolio, and you must have been willing to absorb enormous short-term paper losses and hold onto your stocks, come what may.If you had been able to do all of that for at least 15 years, you would have been fine, because for every 15-year period since 1926, the stock market has never declined, said Sebastien Page, head of asset allocation for T. Rowe Price. That\u2019s great if you didn\u2019t need your money for 15-year stretches.That\u2019s why it\u2019s been difficult to remain serene about stocks \u2014 and why pure stock holdings have been dangerous for people who have actually needed to use their money. Globally diversified portfolios containing stocks and bonds have made more sense for most people, Mr. Page said.These numbers provide a compelling argument based on history for diversification and long-term investing, despite whatever worries you may have about the current state of American politics.\u201cOur best advice is stay diversified, stay the course and remember the role of stocks in your portfolio,\u201d said Joe Davis, global chief economist and head of the investment strategy group at Vanguard.For, say, a 20-year-old with money that she won\u2019t need for 50 years, a portfolio containing only diversified stock investments may make sense. For a 70-year-old facing retirement, a large dollop of diversified, high-quality bonds may be smart, even though bond returns may be constrained or negative, with interest rates possibly rising from current low levels. (Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions; while higher rates mean more income, they also imply lower prices on bonds.)In a stock market downturn, high-quality bonds are likely to perform well, Mr. Davis said. \u201cBonds have been negatively correlated with the stock market, and that\u2019s very valuable,\u201d he said.Based on the past, the outlook for the next five to 10 years isn\u2019t wonderful. Valuation measures for both stocks and bonds suggest that returns will be lower than they have been, but that has little to do with Mr. Trump. It was the consensus before the election results came in, and it was based mainly on the relatively high levels of asset prices and on the slow growth expected for the economy. It implies that investors should exercise patience and self-restraint.All of this also implies that history is relevant, of course \u2014 and that could be a mistake. It is possible that Mr. Trump will throw America onto a new path that isn\u2019t captured by past market statistics.How likely is that? No one knows. For what it\u2019s worth, the stock market isn\u2019t predicting a dystopian future. To the contrary, despite political turmoil, stocks have been extraordinarily steady, performing as though there were no clouds on any foreseeable horizon.Consider that the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index hasn\u2019t dropped 1 percent in a single day since Oct. 11. That\u2019s unusual. There hasn\u2019t been a comparable stretch since 2006, according to Bespoke Investment Group, an investment advisory firm based in Harrison, N.Y., and, before that, it last happened in 1995.The market has generally not had major declines soon after such periods \u2014 though big declines have occurred sooner or later. The problem is that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to know in advance when such a decline is about to start.If we are on the brink of one now, cash would be better than stock, but pulling out of the market carries a major risk of its own \u2014 missing out on stellar returns.\u201cThere are people who exited the stock market in 2008 and never returned,\u201d Mr. Davis said. They missed one of the greatest rallies in history. From the start of 2009 through January, the overall market has tripled in value, including dividends. That bears out the claim that it has been better to stay in the markets \u2014 as long as you have been able to hold on for very long periods.But if you are rattled now and determined to liquidate your holdings, he said, it\u2019s important to decide in advance what it will take for you to return. It could be a specific political outcome or a market drop of, say, 20 percent. Whatever it is, Mr. Davis said, write it down.Beyond that, remember that a long-term and well-diversified bet on the stock market is an investment in long-term economic growth. Unless we head into another dark age, that\u2019s a good bet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Effect: What\u2019s an Investor to Do?", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWhen Donald J. Trump won the presidential election, investors seemed positively giddy about what he was going to do to improve the nation\u2019s economy. Believing that his promises to reduce corporate taxes and curtail costly regulations would unleash economic growth, investors pushed stock indexes to new heights.Hope always plays a powerful role in the financial markets \u2014 and then reality sets in. So, as President Trump gets down to work, investors are now scratching their heads trying to figure out what his presidency will really mean for their portfolios.The recent flurry of executive orders from the new president provides a taste of what may lie ahead. This much is clear to many strategists: Mr. Trump\u2019s mercurial tendencies will bring heightened volatility to individual stocks as well as to the securities markets over all. Let\u2019s just say that fastening your seatbelt is probably a smart move.Mr. Trump prides himself on being a disrupter. So investors had better get used to this approach and the volatility it will bring.Professional traders love volatility, of course, darting in and out of positions to take advantage of precipitous price moves. But buy-and-hold investors often find this action disorienting, and it can chase them out of their holdings at the wrong time. For them, rising volatility is a risk.By the most popular measure, volatility still remains low. The index that measures the implied volatility in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, known as the Vix, stood at around 12 recently, very near the low for the range during the last year.\u201cThose levels are double and triple where they were a year or two ago,\u201d Mr. Kotok said of forward loan contracts. \u201cIf Libor is the same and the interest rate in forward rate agreements is rising, under that construction you are seeing a rising risk premium.\u201dThe stock market rose sharply on Friday, and it does not seem that investors are questioning Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to growing the nation\u2019s economy. Instead, they may be fearful that his bludgeon-force management style will imperil his goals.What makes this period especially difficult for investors is Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to make big decisions without weighing the far-reaching and longer-term consequences.Consider, for example, the perhaps surprising effect that the order banning entry to people from seven countries will have on American colleges and domestic students.As college costs have rocketed in recent years, foreign students, who typically pay in full for tuition, have become an increasingly significant group on American campuses. The number of international students in the country has grown 70 percent over the past decade \u2014 to 5 percent of total enrollment, or more than one million students, said Patricia Healy, a portfolio manager at Cumberland Advisors who specializes in municipal bonds.International students contribute mightily to the revenues at educational institutions; as such, they help subsidize other students who are unable to cover the cost of college, including those from the United States.\u201cMany institutions, especially private ones in urban settings and those that are research-oriented, would be significantly affected by a drop-off in international enrollment,\u201d Ms. Healy wrote to clients in a research note. \u201cThe ban may not have an immediate effect on the finances of universities, unless there are expenses to aid displaced students; but it will have negative ramifications for these and other institutions in the long run if foreign students reconsider coming to the U.S. for their education.\u201dFewer international students enrolling at American universities will mean that fewer domestic students may receive the tuition help they need to pursue their degrees or to conduct research. This is just one of the consequences of restricting the travel of international students.Given how markets react to the kind of disruption that Mr. Trump revels in, how can investors protect themselves?Consider reducing risk exposures by retreating to higher-quality instruments. After years of low interest rates, investors have flocked to lower-grade bonds in search of higher yields. Now is the time to rethink that approach, because of the potential for volatility and higher interest rates.\u201cHigher-quality bonds could be a bit of a buffer if rates go up and news events cause more volatility,\u201d Ms. Healy said in an interview. \u201cThese investments have the strength to withstand it.\u201dInvestors should also acknowledge that we are in uncharted territory. \u201cIt is remarkable that the markets still see a Trump presidency as positive,\u201d Mr. Ashworth of Capital Economics said. \u201cPolitical volatility has never been higher, and market volatility has never been lower. It\u2019s an interesting contrast.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mischaracterizations, Misrepresentations and Lies", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere he goes again. Donald Trump may be a month into his presidency, but his public remarks continue to be laden with the same mischaracterizations, misrepresentations and, yes, lies as his campaign.Mr. Trump\u2019s alternate reality has been on vivid display in venues ranging from an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla., to a gathering of conservatives last week just outside the nation\u2019s capital.\u201cJobs are already starting to pour back in,\u201d he yelled to the crowd in Florida. \u201cObamacare covers very few people,\u201d he insisted in MarylandThe small problem with these \u201cfacts\u201d and so many more in his florid rhetoric is that they are not true.He has extolled, for example, announcements by General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Intel to hire tens of thousands of workers in the United States instead of in Mexico.But each of these companies was already planning to make the employment moves or did them for business reasons unrelated to Mr. Trump.\u201cAll of these decisions,\u201d said Pat Morrissey, a G.M. spokesman, \u201chave been in the works for some time.\u201dThen there are the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, which Mr. Trump contended will create as many as 42,000 jobs.And those are just temporary jobs; the permanent job count at Keystone will be 35.The only jobs that he could legitimately claim to have preserved would be the 800 Carrier jobs in Indiana that were \u201csaved\u201d with the help of $7 million in state subsidies.As for the Affordable Care Act, by every estimate, more than 20 million Americans have received health insurance through it.As for Lockheed Martin and the F-35 fighter jet, which has indeed been a troubled program, the company had already agreed to reduce the cost of each plane as production ramped up.\u201cAll President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue,\u201d said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \u201cHe\u2019s not responsible for the savings; they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene.\u201dIn Melbourne, Mr. Trump also took a victory lap for the rising stock market and the \u201cgreat spirit of optimism\u201d that is \u201csweeping all across the country.\u201d So how does he explain his 43 percent approval rating?To be sure, he\u2019s correct to note that the stock market has been hitting record highs, and various measures of business confidence have also been on the rise.But those positive signals result not from anything Mr. Trump has done to make America Great Again but from a bunch of stuff he\u2019s promising to do to make business great again.You don\u2019t have to be a stock market expert to appreciate that when a president says he\u2019s going to significantly cut business taxes and emasculate regulations that may be limiting profitability, of course stocks are going to go up.Indeed, the sectors that have shot up the most \u2014 including financials, steel, oil services and coal \u2014 are precisely the ones most likely to benefit from Trumponomics.Some investors \u2014 including myself \u2014 wondered whether Mr. Trump\u2019s volatile style would scare the markets more than his planned giveaways to corporate America would buoy them. That verdict is in (at least for now).But both stock market indexes and business confidence have benefited from recent data suggesting that economic growth began accelerating modestly well before Mr. Trump took office.Indicators like retail sales and factory output have been on the rise. Meanwhile, outside the United States, sclerotic Europe has managed to inch its growth rate up close to ours, while key emerging economies like China \u2014 a perennial worry for markets \u2014 seem to be on a sustained upward trajectory.What markets should worry about is whether Mr. Trump will be able to deliver on his overwhelmingly pro-business agenda. If he falls short, look for the stock market to wobble and perhaps swoon.At least in the meantime, however, Mr. Trump is busily trying to take credit for positive signs that were in fact nurtured on Barack Obama\u2019s watch.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Victory for Trump Is a Victory for Big-Name Traders", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCarl C. Icahn is one of several billionaire investors who have bet big on a Donald J. Trump presidency.So bullish was Mr. Icahn that he said he made $1 billion worth of bets in the stock market the morning after Mr. Trump won the election.In a regulatory filing on Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Icahn, 80, revealed some of the other bets he made in the last three months of 2016. He loaded up on shares of his company, Icahn Enterprises, which invests in a variety of industries. Mr. Icahn also increased his position in Herbalife, the beleaguered vitamin supplements company in which he already owned more than 20 percent of the outstanding shares.Mr. Icahn\u2019s stock trading since the election has interested some Democratic senators, who recently raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest given his role as a special adviser to Mr. Trump on overhauling regulation.It is not just Mr. Icahn who is betting big on Mr. Trump. More broadly, Wall Street has turned bullish in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, pinning its hopes on a new administration \u2014 with a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 delivering big tax cuts and rolling back regulation.The American stock market has risen to a record high even as the White House has come under scrutiny for a ban on immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries \u2014 blocked while the matter is argued in court \u2014 and the resignation on Monday of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser over concerns about conversations he had with Russian officials before Mr. Trump was sworn into office.In the months since the election, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index has soared about 9 percent. Banks and other financial stocks have risen about 20 percent, while industrial stocks, including manufacturing and construction firms, have risen about 11 percent. Consumer company shares have gained roughly 9 percent.Mr. Icahn was one of hundreds of hedge fund and other investment fund managers to make their quarterly declarations to the S.E.C. about which stocks they bought in recent months. Known as 13-Fs, these reports offer investors a glimpse at where these professional traders placed their bets during a given quarter, though they are filed roughly 45 days after the quarter ends.But the filings offer an imperfect window into the holdings of money managers because they are a snapshot of the past. They include only stocks traded in the United States but do not include short positions, or bets a manager might have made that a stock will fall in price. They also do not include bets on the future direction of the market, a favorite trade of Mr. Icahn and his firm.This time, however, the regulatory filings reveal the big rush of money into the market over a quarter that coincided with Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory.Many of the hedge fund managers jumping on the so-called \u201cTrump Bump\u201d trade loaded up on financial stocks in the final quarter of the year, riding shares of banks like Goldman Sachs Group, which are up more than 37 percent since the election, and Bank of America, which has had a more than 40 percent gain over the same period. Some of the big-name managers whose firms added stakes in financial stocks in the final months of 2016 included Daniel S. Loeb, Julian Robertson, David Tepper and O. Andreas Halvorsen.Nelson Peltz\u2019s firm, Trian Fund Management, took a big 4.86 percent stake in Procter & Gamble, one of the largest manufacturers of family, personal and household care products. Mr. Peltz has a reputation as an activist investor who takes stake in companies and then pushes for corporate changes to increase shareholder value. His firm also added shares of Bank of New York Mellon.Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage finance firms that the federal government placed in conservatorship during the financial crisis, also have surged since Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Shares of Fannie, for instance, are up more than 160 percent. The rally has been prompted in part by comments from Steven T. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary and a former hedge fund manager.Mr. Mnuchin said he favored the recapitalization of the two firms and would plan to cut the government\u2019s hold over them. Mr. Mnuchin, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, made those comments a day after Mr. Trump nominated him.His early comments on Fannie and Freddie were welcome news to a group of hedge fund managers, like Paulson & Co. and William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management, that bet on mortgage finance firms. Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm acquired big stakes in shares of both Fannie and Freddie in late 2013 and the stocks are two of his firm\u2019s big winners in 2016 \u2014 a year in which one of Pershing Square\u2019s portfolios lost a little more than 13 percent.Paulson & Co, a firm led by John Paulson in which Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin have been investors at various times, reported trimming its bet on gold through an exchange traded fund. The firm also bought a new stake in the drug company GlaxoSmithKline.But Mr. Icahn\u2019s bet will be of most interest with politicians in Washington, where Senators have sought assurances from the White House that safeguards would be put in place to ensure Mr. Icahn does not have access to information that is not public and could be used to make a profitable trade.Icahn Enterprises, Mr. Icahn\u2019s firm, has several large investments in companies that are directly affected by regulations, which he has described as stifling. In the fourth quarter, he acquired another 2.9 million shares of his company.It is his majority investment in CVR Refining, an oil refiner that is a core investment of Icahn Enterprises, which is of biggest concern to lawmakers. CVR is required by the Environmental Protection Agency to blend its oil or buy credits, something that Mr. Icahn has called \u201ccompletely totally absurd.\u201dMr. Icahn, who did not return phone calls seeking comment, has blamed the E.P.A. for the bankruptcy of several oil refineries in the United States.Still, in Tuesday\u2019s filing, he did not report any change in the number of shares his firm has in CVR.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Talk Rattles Aerospace Industry, Up and Down Supply Chain", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHEHALIS, Wash. \u2014 At this small factory south of Seattle, employees make one of the most specialized products in the aerospace industry: the rubber mats that Boeing workers stand on while assembling jets. As long as there are jets and Boeing, business would seem to be steady. But even here workers are bracing for bumps and economic uncertainty over the gritty details of where aviation parts get made and who makes them.The anxiety, said Mr. Bishop, 46, a former deputy county sheriff who voted for Mr. Trump, centers not so much on politics as economics, specifically the intense competition with the French airplane maker Airbus, which competes toe to toe with Boeing for jet orders in countries around the world in a delicate game of narrow cost differences and giant contracts.\u201cSo what does it mean? It means they may cut jobs,\u201d said Kevin Michaels, the managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a specialized market analysis company in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complex field.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got such a huge network here \u2014 anything that curtails exports hurts the entire supply chain,\u201d said John Thornquist, the director of the aerospace office at the Washington State Department of Commerce. \u201cWe\u2019re very vulnerable.\u201dCompanies that sell to Boeing, or sell to other companies that build Boeing components, said that even predicting a trade war was risky, with so many variables \u2014 politics, economics, multiple countries \u2014 all in play. A modern commercial jetliner can have up to six million components that must be engineered and tested to safety standards, even before assembly starts.\u201cYou prepare yourself for the worst and hope for the best,\u201d he said.Other aerospace companies were hesitant to discuss their worries because it might draw unwanted attention \u2014 from competitors, the White House or foreign governments. It is not a good time, several said, to take chances.Boeing declined an interview request for this article, but said in an email statement that talks with the Trump administration were continuing. \u201cThe administration has made it clear that they are pro-economic growth, including in exports and manufacturing jobs,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are engaged with the administration in direct and productive discussion.\u201dIn any small business, optimism and practicality are lifeblood forces, and SmartCells\u2019 president, Bryce L. Betteridge, a chemical engineer, says he believes the company\u2019s future is bright. A trade-secret mix of polymers and wafflelike molds creates the upward bounce of a SmartCells mat, which reduces fatigue for a standing person and can also prevent injuries in falls, he said.The company has already diversified. Amazon warehouse workers and Costco checkout clerks \u2014 both employed by companies that started out in the Seattle area \u2014 stand on SmartCells mats. And Mr. Betteridge mentioned other new markets and ideas with enthusiasm: rifle stocks, nursing home floors, playgrounds. No idea for a better cushion seems beyond reach.But he said the company\u2019s strategy for the future was shifting on the assumption that international trade under Mr. Trump would become more difficult. For one thing, he said, he has now discarded any thought of expanding the company into China, Mexico or anywhere else where SmartCells\u2019 products could be made and brought into the United States for sale. \u201cThat benefit is going to go away, I anticipate,\u201d Mr. Betteridge said.And it is simply too expensive to export heavy, relatively low-cost products like cushion mats to other countries from Washington, he said. That means the company\u2019s growth in foreign markets, when or if it happens, will probably come through licensing the technology to manufacturers abroad, which will then hire local workers. Sales and marketing positions might be added here in Chehalis, Mr. Betteridge said, but no added manufacturing jobs would be needed.But a pressure to \u201cbuy American\u201d coming from the White House could also be a powerful force, he and other industry leaders said, if companies like Boeing ultimately shift a greater proportion of their airplane component purchases to suppliers in the United States. Currently, Boeing spends about 80 percent of its $40 billion annual supply-chain budget in the United States, and exports about 75 percent of its products.\u201cSome of the suppliers in Puget Sound might actually be rooting for this, because in the long run it could benefit them,\u201d Mr. Michaels, the industry analyst, said.Kurt Mullins, 56, a former lumber millworker who has been at SmartCells for about a year and a half, often installs floor cushioning systems at Boeing, where he hears the worries of workers there, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d Mr. Mullins said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Falling Home Prices Could Be a Good Thing", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySimplifying ShelterSuppose there were a way to pump up the economy, reduce inequality and put an end to destructive housing bubbles like the one that contributed to the Great Recession. The idea would be simple, but not easy, requiring a wholesale reframing of the United States economy and housing market.The solution: Americans, together and all at once, would have to stop thinking about their homes as an investment.Another big problem: High rent and home prices prevent Americans from moving to cities where jobs and wages are booming. That hampers economic growth, makes income inequality worse and keeps people from pursuing their dreams.In this thought experiment, housing prices would probably adjust. They would be somewhat cheaper in most places, where population is growing slowly. But they would be profoundly cheaper in places like super-expensive San Francisco.According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that\u2019s what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.We would still see homes of different sizes and styles \u2014 condos in some places, single-family homes in others \u2014 depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project\u2019s timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.That is a theoretical figure that includes easy-to-see things like increased sales of building materials and more jobs for construction workers. Most of the increase, however, would come from more abstract gains like increased wages for people who are willing to move from an economically distressed city to a faster-growing economy elsewhere, but are currently unable to because housing is too expensive.Over time, the accelerated pace of building could lead to a long-run deflation in home values. But for the most part that would be limited to a few coastal cities. And while the older homeowners there would most likely be resentful of all the new apartments, condos and townhomes that caused their home equity to shrivel, younger people would have an easier time getting started.Moreover, it\u2019s likely that lower home prices would encourage workers to move farther and more often in search of job opportunities. The impact on mobility could be huge, as the $1.5 trillion figure shows.Today, people with less education tend to go where housing is cheap, like Las Vegas, while college-educated workers with skills that are in demand still go to places where wages are high, like the Bay Area.Finally, if housing were plentiful and cheap, we would probably stop having big housing bubbles. One good way of describing a speculative bubble is a moment when society deludes itself into believing that something plentiful is scarce, or will soon be. In the mid-2000s, banks and homeowners came to believe that homes would be scarce in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, even though there were enough materials, land and labor to keep building and building and building.Housing is particularly prone to bubbles because, in contrast with other products, we seem to want it more when it is expensive and less when it is cheap. And no matter how many times we look out an airplane window to see vast acres of emptiness, we somehow still believe that land is a great investment because nobody is making more of it.Homes would still hold a lot of value; they still might appreciate, if more slowly; and desirable neighborhoods would still seem relatively expensive. But there would probably be fewer manias in which people expect home prices to double in just a few years.Just as we don\u2019t expect to make a profit selling our cars, if we stopped thinking of our homes as big moneymakers, we would probably start focusing on building them faster and less expensively.Homes would be stacked together, creating de facto apartment buildings that could be built and unbuilt in a few weeks. Although that wouldn\u2019t do much to help a family of four, it might take some pressure off the housing market by directing younger people to studios instead of having them pile in together, freeing up some three-bedroom apartments for families.For now, Americans seem unlikely to embrace this vision on a large scale, and even if they did, it would take a long time to start seeing home prices drop or flatline. But mass-produced homes from the past \u2014 brick townhouses or bungalows that came from a Sears catalog \u2014 are now sought after, so this imaginary world needn\u2019t be uglier, though it very well may be.Also, even if homes were a lot cheaper, we would probably retain the societal benefits of homeownership: As Mr. Glaeser and Mr. Gyourko\u2019s data shows, housing is already relatively affordable in the vast majority of American cities. So there is little reason to believe that people would desert overpriced neighborhoods if they suddenly became cheaper.This does not mean that select places like New York\u2019s West Village or San Francisco\u2019s Mission District would suddenly be affordable \u2014 or that American cities would suddenly fill up with towering condominiums and blocks of identical rowhouses. Housing is a regional problem, spread across miles of cities and suburbs, so a lot of new development would probably occur in close-in suburbs where there is more land than people think.Take Boston. The median Boston suburb has a minimum lot size of one acre, and many suburbs have minimum lot sizes of one home per two or four acres. That is a huge drag on the region\u2019s overall housing supply, according to Mr. Glaeser.Yes, adding more homes, even medium-density ones, would annoy people looking for less crowded quarters. But the nation as a whole would probably be better off, both in jobs and in financial security. The money not spent on housing could flow to other, possibly more productive, investments \u2014 like stocks in new companies or bonds for infrastructure projects.Of course, our view of homeownership is so entrenched in our economy, our political system and our tax code that it would be impossible to change in a short time, and probably even in a long time. But there could be political and societal benefits. What if local decisions that today are dictated by fears of declining property values could instead be made with an eye toward what\u2019s best for education or job growth?The point of this thought experiment isn\u2019t to embrace it full-on, but to open our eyes to the negatives of the national obsession of owning a home, expecting its value to rise, and using the levers of local government to keep neighborhoods as they are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank of Japan Will Buy U.S. Private Equity Giant Fortress", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver its three-decade existence, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and its founder, Masayoshi Son, have been known for ambitious and sometimes head-scratching moves.Now, SoftBank is nearing its most unusual move yet: It is buying Fortress Investment Group, an American private equity giant that oversees around $70 billion in assets.Over the past three decades, SoftBank has become one of Japan\u2019s most formidable technology companies. It is perhaps best known for its telecommunications empire, which stretches from Japan to Sprint in the United States. SoftBank also has portfolio of investments that includes stakes in the Alibaba Group of China, the Japanese affiliate of Yahoo and start-ups like the online lender SoFi. At its helm, the entire time, has been Mr. Son.An American-trained businessman, Mr. Son began the business as a software distributor, but eventually moved into cellphone service and became the first Japanese carrier to embrace the iPhone. He has never been known for his modesty, repeatedly boasting about outsize ambitions like dethroning Verizon and AT&T atop the American wireless industry with Sprint.SoftBank will be paying $3.3 billion for Fortress, a premium to the company\u2019s stock market value of $2.3 billion. As part of the agreement, SoftBank has the option of bringing in partners to help cover the cost of the deal and who may want to become investors in Fortress funds, too, thus increasing assets under management.The deal frees up Peter L. Briger Jr. and Wesley R. Edens of Fortress to focus on their strengths as fund managers \u2014 several of their private equity funds have produced double-digit returns over time \u2014 without having to deal with the headaches of running a public company. As leaders of a public company, they struggled mightily to bolster their stock, more so than their competitors. Recently, the firm shut down its flagship hedge fund.The purchase of Fortress, a prominent private equity firm with a specialty in investing in distressed assets, was driven by Rajeev Misra, a former top derivatives expert at Deutsche Bank who has taken a leading role in setting investment strategy for the SoftBank Vision Fund.After leaving Deutsche Bank in 2008, where he had worked closely with Anshu Jain, who headed the bank\u2019s global markets operations, Mr. Misra went to UBS and then spent several months at Fortress, where he came to know the firm\u2019s chairmen, Mr. Briger and Mr. Edens, well.Now, Mr. Misra will be helping steer an enormous new fund that is intended to invest in technology companies worldwide, often by taking huge stakes. SoftBank is expected to contribute at least $25 billion to the fund, while partners in the fund include Saudi Arabia and Apple.All told, SoftBank will now oversee assets under management of $170 billion, making it one of the largest private investors in the world after the Blackstone Group, which manages about $330 billion.While private equity firms have performed poorly as publicly traded stocks, they are attractive in part because of their ability to lock up money for multiple years and charge high fees.As an entity that is regulated \u2014 if relatively lightly compared with, say, a bank \u2014 Fortress will have to operate at arm\u2019s length from the $100 billion Vision Fund when it comes to making investments. And the team of investors under Mr. Misra and Mr. Son will also remain unchanged.Still, it expected that there will be ample opportunity for the Vision Fund to benefit from shared intelligence between the two entities. That could mean Fortress seeing a deal in a telecommunications company that does not fit its mandate and passing it along to the Vision Fund. The transaction also widens the Vision Fund\u2019s capacity to source new investments, given Fortress\u2019s global network.For Fortress, the motivation was to join with one of the world\u2019s most innovative investors and to enter global markets, like the Middle East, where they have trailed some of their peers.Fortress went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2007, before the financial crisis. But shares of Fortress, like shares of other publicly traded private equity firms, have performed poorly in recent years. Fortress\u2019s stock price is down 80 percent since it began trading, and its executives have made no secret that the joy of being a public company has largely evaporated.The firm\u2019s struggles trace to the financial crisis, when it was slow to exit the subprime loan business, forcing heavy losses. The stock dipped below $1, and the firm did not consistently return to profitability until 2012.At the same time, Mr. Edens positioned the firm to capitalize on the economic recovery, piling back into the subprime business through its purchase of the mortgage servicer Nationstar and consumer lender Springleaf, now known as OneMain Financial. Mr. Edens, a former Lehman Brothers partner who co-founded Fortress, has turned the firm\u2019s $124 million Springleaf investment into a stake valued at roughly $2 billion.Under the terms of the deal, Fortress will become an independent subsidiary of SoftBank. Fortress\u2019s principals, who control roughly a third of the firm\u2019s voting shares, have agreed to vote in favor of the sale, which is expected to close by year\u2019s end.On Tuesday, before the deal was announced, shares of Fortress rose 6.5 percent on unusually heavy trading volume.Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap Aims for Valuation of More Than $20 Billion in I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The parent company of Snapchat is poised to hold one of the biggest initial public offerings in years, but while its market debut is eagerly awaited, the start-up has so far tempered expectations for the size of the stock sale.Even at the top of that range, Snap would end up with a valuation on the lower end of the $20 billion to $25 billion mark that it had anticipated months ago. Either way, it is still up from the approximately $16.5 billion the company valued itself late last year.The final pricing of the new shares \u2014 and the company\u2019s valuation \u2014 could still change. The share price will be not be set until after Snap embarks on a nearly two-week tour of investors that will take its executives across the country. The company is expected to begin trading around March 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol SNAP.Even if the value were to drop, it would still be one of the biggest technology offerings of the decade. At this stage of the offering process, Twitter was valued at more than $12 billion, including options and restricted stock units, in October 2013. A year earlier, Facebook was valued at $86 billion at a similar stage.Three of Snap\u2019s top executives \u2014 the co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel, the chief strategy officer Imran Khan and the chief financial officer Andrew Vollero \u2014 will make the tour along with underwriters to pitch investors on what remains the most highly anticipated I.P.O. so far this year.The road show, as the process is known, formally began on Thursday as the three men visited several of the underwriters. Morgan Stanley, the lead bank, hosted the executives at its Midtown Manhattan headquarters to speak with its sales force in a standing-room-only meeting.Morgan Stanley also plastered Snap\u2019s name \u2014 in its familiar bright yellow \u2014 on the electronic zipper outside its building.And Goldman Sachs installed a vending machine that sells Snap\u2019s Spectacles \u2014 sunglasses with an integrated camera that can upload videos to Snapchat \u2014 in the mezzanine lobby of its downtown Manhattan headquarters.The message that Snap is selling is relatively simple. The company has quickly become one of the technology world\u2019s brightest stars, and its offering stands out in a largely barren landscape for new stocks.But potential investors are liable to question whether Snap can maintain its enviable user growth rate, particularly as Facebook has unabashedly copied many of the service\u2019s top features within Instagram.Snap\u2019s executives will most likely emphasize how highly the service\u2019s users are engaged with the app, which as of last year averaged about 158 million users each day. Unlike other social media companies, Snap has been clear in prioritizing North America and Europe over more global ambitions, at least for now.Prospective investors may also question how long Snap will take to post a profit. The company has disclosed that it lost $514 million last year, up from $373 million in 2015. But its revenue grew by about seven times over that same span, to $404.5 million last year from $58.7 million in 2015.Investors who buy into Snap will have little say in the company\u2019s strategic direction, however. Even after the I.P.O., Mr. Spiegel and a fellow co-founder, Robert Murphy, are expected to retain nearly 89 percent of the voting shares because the shares to be sold in the offering will hold no voting rights.From its beginning in a Stanford dorm room six years ago, Snapchat has grown from a trendy redoubt for millennials into a top destination for both users and advertisers. It started life as a way for people to send self-destructing photo messages to friends, but it has since added more ambitious tools that let users compile \u201cstories\u201d about their days and special filters that let users transform their faces into dogs, fairies or paid-for content like Taco Bell tacos.Snap is expected to produce huge wealth \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 for its existing investors, notably Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, who each own 227 million shares. At the midpoint of Thursday\u2019s price range, their holdings would be worth about $3.4 billion each.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peak Market?", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsLike any good private-equity investor, Carlyle has demonstrated a knack for buying when others are selling, and vice versa. It is instructive then that Carlyle, led by David Rubenstein, is embarking on its biggest quest for distressed assets at a time when tax-cut hopes are fanning Wall Street euphoria. The $2.5 billion fund is a good reminder that lofty valuations, an aging recovery and a chaotic new administration can produce bad outcomes.The new vehicle dwarfs Carlyle\u2019s 2011 distressed fund, a $700 million one. With rich pickings still available in the aftermath of the financial crisis, that vehicle has generated a 21 percent annualized return after accounting for fees \u2014 an impressive accomplishment given that 10-year Treasury yields traded narrowly around 2 percent for much of that period.Today, rates are rising amid expectations that President Trump will stoke economic growth with tax cuts. Stocks are on a record-setting tear, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index up 10.5 percent since the election and the Dow Jones industrial average rising 13.5 percent. Bankruptcy filings by publicly listed companies fell by one-third last year and are running at barely one-quarter the pace of 2009, which was the height of the crisis.Yet it is precisely that ebullience that indicates Carlyle\u2019s timing is good. The president\u2019s struggles to get his cabinet seated and backlash over his immigration order suggest tax reform is hardly a slam dunk. The S.&P. is trading at nearly 29 times the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio developed by Robert Shiller, a Yale economist. That level has been exceeded only during the tech bubble in 2000 and just before the 1929 crash, according to the data. If bankruptcies appear to have nowhere to go but up, they just might.Carlyle is not the only firm to turn its eye to the distressed market. In 2016, firms raised more than $16 billion to invest in struggling assets, a 300 percent jump from 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. If past cycles are anything to go by, that powder won\u2019t stay dry for long.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Damien Hirst Alienated Collectors. Will His New Work Win Them Back?", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine the Rolling Stones coming out with a new acoustic album or Christo preparing to wrap some remote island in parachute fabric.Has the art-world darling of the \u201990s \u2014 who led the so-called Young British Artists, or Y.B.A.s, and was known for his $12 million shark in a tank \u2014 jumped the shark? And given that many buyers were left bitterly holding the bag after Mr. Hirst flooded the market with his work at the Sotheby\u2019s sale, doing an end run around his dealers, will collectors give him another chance?\u201cHe\u2019s certainly confounded the market before. It depends on how successful the work is,\u201d said Marc Porter, a chairman of Sotheby\u2019s fine art division. \u201cHe\u2019s taking on Venice and that\u2019s audacious.\u201dThe project, \u201cTreasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable,\u201d according to those who have glimpsed it, resembles jeweled buried treasure covered with coral as if just pulled out of the ocean, like relics from the lost city of Atlantis or Captain Nemo. It includes some 250 pieces in various sizes ranging in price from about $400,000 for small jade objects to $4 million for a malachite head of Medusa.Potential buyers cannot view the work in person, nor can they receive images by email, a courtesy typically afforded top collectors. Instead, a representative from one of Mr. Hirst\u2019s two galleries \u2014 Gagosian in New York and White Cube in London \u2014 visits with an iPad to flip through photographs of the work.Already his market is showing signs of strengthening. One of his large butterfly canvases sold at Christie\u2019s in November for a respectable $1 million, given the estimate of $900,000 to $1.2 million.Just about everyone in the art world agrees that Mr. Hirst has some healing to do. While he pulled off the unthinkable by selling $200 million of his work at the Sotheby\u2019s sale on Sept. 15, 2008 \u2014 bypassing the usual gallery channels and on the same infamous day that Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy \u2014 the result was a surfeit of Hirst pieces on the market, which hurt his prices.\u201cIn many ways that auction marked the beginning of the end,\u201d said the dealer Helly Nahmad.Where his pill cabinet \u201cLullaby Spring\u201d sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 2007 for $19.2 million, for example, his pill cabinet \u201cLullaby Winter\u201d sold at Christie\u2019s in 2015 for $4.6 million. More recently, one of his spot paintings sold in Sotheby\u2019s contemporary art day sale in November for just $396,500, considerably lower than the $1.7 million they sometimes fetched in 2013.\u201cPeople inexplicably bought into that sale, precipitating a downward market death spiral that took us all down with them,\u201d said Adam Lindemann, the collector and dealer, referring to Mr. Hirst\u2019s all-Hirst Sotheby\u2019s auction. \u201cHis market collapsed and hasn\u2019t really revived since.\u201cAnd now he\u2019s back like Arnold,\u201d Mr. Lindemann continued, referring to a line from Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s \u201cTerminator\u201d films. \u201cRemember the old saying, \u2018Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.\u2019\u201dBecause Mr. Hirst is so prolific, there is the growing sense that his works are ubiquitous, an impression that would be countered, collectors say, by a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 that offered a full accounting of his work.\u201cAs an investor, which I am, before undertaking such an investment you have to really make sure that the production is somewhat under control,\u201d Mr. Nahmad said. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t like chaos and the market doesn\u2019t like confusion. If Damien Hirst came out with an extensive catalogue raisonn\u00e9, people could see an order to his body of work. How many units exist? How many butterflies? How many spot paintings?\u201dAt the same time, art experts say, Mr. Hirst is the real deal \u2014 not just a flash in the pan or a relic of the past, but an artist with exceptional talent and staying power.True, he had the temerity to charge $100 million for a diamond encrusted skull in 2007 and to take over all of Gagosian\u2019s galleries in 2012 (11 of them at the time) with a retrospective of his spot paintings. But Mr. Hirst, collectors, dealers and auction executives say, is worthy of attention, as evidenced by the Tate Modern\u2019s decision to devote a retrospective to his work in 2012.\u201cHe is still one of the greatest artists of this century,\u201d said the real estate developer Aby Rosen, who described himself as \u201clong on Hirst\u201d in his art collection, calling the new \u201cTreasures\u201d work \u201cstunning.\u201d\u201cHe will produce till he dies because he has so much brain \u2014 he\u2019s so deep,\u201d Mr. Rosen added. \u201cAnd this guy is not going away.\u201dAs to whether collectors unable to sell their Hirsts had a right to be frustrated, Mr. Rosen said: \u201cIf you want to be a collector, you have to collect wide and deep, and within your portfolio things will go up and down. If you buy two stocks and one goes down, don\u2019t be angry at IBM or G.M.\u201dThere are those who say that Mr. Hirst\u2019s coming shows in Venice are inextricably linked with Mr. Pinault, who owns Christie\u2019s auction house and has avidly collected Mr. Hirst\u2019s work. Does he want to jump-start the Hirst market out of self-interest, art experts ask, to raise the value of his own holdings?Whatever the case, most agree that Mr. Hirst \u2014 with an estimated net worth of $350 million \u2014 doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201cI do believe that Damien Hirst \u2014 especially early Damien Hirst \u2014 will have an important footprint in art history,\u201d Mr. Nahmad said. \u201cThe true die-hard Damien Hirst collectors, if they love what he\u2019s doing now, they\u2019ll buy into it and disregard that this guy so many times in the past has way overproduced.\u201dPerhaps more than any other artist, Mr. Hirst has embodied the meteoric rise of the artist as celebrity, the auction market at its height and collectors competing to pay millions for a stuffed shark or flattened butterfly. But as art has increasingly become an asset class, Mr. Hirst has also come to symbolize how a high-flying stock can tank. Here, a look back at some of the critical junctures in the volatile yet riveting trajectory of Mr. Hirst.1991: FormaldehydeMr. Hirst takes the art world by storm with his tiger shark suspended in formaldehyde, which the billionaire hedge-fund manager Steven A. Cohen buys for a reported $12 million.1990s: ButterfliesMr. Hirst explores themes like death and science with butterflies pinned under glass.2000s: Pill CabinetsMr. Hirst\u2019s colored, handmade pills recall Victorian curiosity cabinets and explore modern notions of medicine.2007: Luxe SkullsMr. Hirst announces sale of his diamond-encrusted skull for $100 million.2008: All-Hirst Sotheby\u2019s Sale Brings $200 MillionMr. Hirst bypasses dealers to sell all 223 works, breaking the record for a single-artist auction, set in 1993 when an 88-work Picasso sale brought $20 million.2009-2017: Tanking at AuctionAfter his Sotheby\u2019s sale, Mr. Hirst\u2019s prices at auction top out at $1.5 million (for his \u201cMickey\u201d canvas at Christie\u2019s London in 2014) and eventually fail to sell (his \u201cBeautiful Mickey Mouse Painting,\u201d estimated at $400,000 to $600,000 at Christie\u2019s in May 2015).January 2012: Spot Paintings EverywhereLarry Gagosian agrees to show Mr. Hirst\u2019s spot paintings in all of his 11 galleries.Mr. Hirst stuns the art world by announcing that he is leaving the Gagosian gallery, where he has been represented for 17 years.2016: Hirst and Gagosian ReuniteFour years after leaving Larry Gagosian, Mr. Hirst returns to the gallery. \u201cI share a long history with Larry,\u201d the artist says in a statement, \u201cand am pleased we are working together once again.\u201d Mr. Gagosian says: \u201cTake Damien Hirst out of contemporary art history, and there\u2019s an incredible void. Great artists, like great people, have second acts.\u201d2017: Hirst to Unveil a New Work at Pinault Collection in VeniceTen years in the making, Mr. Hirst\u2019s exhibition is to open just before the Venice Biennale, the first time that the two Venetian locations of the Pinault Collection will be dedicated to a single artist.An earlier version of this article misstated the month in 2012 that Damien Hirst left Gagosian gallery.

{"Headline": "Is Your Financial Adviser Acting in Your Best Interest?", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersThis is a tale of two mutual funds with abysmal performance \u2014 but very different reactions from their investors to their returns.The Ivy Asset Strategy \u2014 which is known as a total return fund, because it tries to maximize gains through a variety of investment strategies \u2014 ranked in the 99th percentile in 2016, according to Morningstar, meaning that investors could scarcely do worse.The Waddell & Reed Asset Strategy, also a total return fund, ranked in the 97th percentile in the same class.But last year, the Ivy fund lost 65 percent of its assets \u2014 meaning that investors pulled out \u2014 while the Waddell & Reed fund lost only 26 percent. Over the last three years, the Ivy fund has lost 82 percent, compared with 41 percent for the Waddell & Reed fund.Given that both funds come from the same family \u2014 the Ivy fund is a product of Waddell & Reed, and they have the same portfolio managers \u2014 it might seem to be a curious question why one dysfunctional family member is being battered more than another.The answer, however, is in plain sight, and of importance to investors: The Waddell & Reed version is sold by Waddell & Reed representatives to their financial advice clients. The Ivy fund can be bought by anyone \u2014 and those independent advisers seem to have told their clients to get out of it.Roger Hoadley, the director of communications for both the Ivy and Waddell & Reed funds, does not dispute the premise that investors pulled out of the former more than the latter because of how their advisers may have steered them. \u201cThose are two funds managed very similarly, just distributed differently,\u201d he wrote in an email response to questions. \u201cSo, the same portfolio manager(s) in each case, almost identical holdings, though there may be slight differences.\u201d\u201cThe Waddell & Reed Advisors funds are offered by the Waddell & Reed Inc. broker/dealer,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Ivy Funds are offered widely\u201d through registered investment advisers, wirehouse brokers and others.The reason that some investors would be told to sell shares in a poorly performing fund \u2014 while others wouldn\u2019t \u2014 can be traced to the two different standards of care in the financial advice world.The standard of \u201csuitability\u201d guides most brokers and registered representatives, like those at Waddell & Reed, and means they will pick an investment that is suitable for you. The fiduciary standard binds an adviser to work in your best financial interests \u2014 and also includes lawyers, certified public accountants and brokers with certain designations, like the chartered financial analyst designation, who have ethical obligations. If the distinction seems subtle, the outcomes aren\u2019t always.Last week, President Trump made an announcement that gave the Labor Department discretion over whether to replace the suitability standard with the fiduciary obligation on retirement assets. The change had been debated for six years and was about to be put in place, but now it may be revised or scrapped entirely.The debate on these two standards brings up an age old-question: How can anyone find an adviser who is going to counsel them on investing their money for the long haul?\u201cIf you\u2019re working with a broker or registered investment adviser, if there\u2019s a brand on their card and the brand of investment they\u2019re recommending matches that, I\u2019d have very heightened awareness and I\u2019d ask a lot more questions,\u201d said Mark Cortazzo, a senior partner at the Macro Consulting Group, an independent adviser.The Waddell & Reed/Ivy situation is stark, but it\u2019s not the only one at those sister funds. The Waddell & Reed Science and Technology Fund ranked in the 92nd percentile for such funds and had outflows of just 8.5 percent last year. The same fund through Ivy Investments had a loss of 39.1 percent of its assets in 2016.Other companies have similar issues. While the MassMutual Financial Group is well known for insurance, its agents also sell financial products. Its Premier Strategic Emerging Markets Fund ranked in the 63rd percentile for similar funds, yet in 2016 its assets increased by 3.7 percent in 2016.OppenheimerFunds, which is owned by MassMutual, offers the same fund with the same managers to its broader range of clients. Given its middling performance among emerging markets funds, its assets fell by 6.4 percent.More starkly, over a three-year period during which the funds ranked in the bottom quartile, the MassMutual version\u2019s assets rose by 65 percent, while the Oppenheimer one lost 15 percent of its assets, as investors and advisers outside of the MassMutual network voted with their dollars.\u201cAsset flows are driven by a number of factors, including the end investor and their investment goals and time horizon,\u201d said Natalie Marin, a spokeswoman for Oppenheimer. How those funds are marketed and sold to investors also factors into how money goes into and out of the funds, she added.To be fair, it\u2019s easy to see the differences with these funds. Most fund manufacturers that also have wealth management divisions have stopped giving the internal and external funds different names. When all money is commingled, it\u2019s harder to tell what money was put there by internal advisers and what came from outside.\u201cMost people would have no way of knowing if it was a conflict,\u201d Mr. Cortazzo said. \u201cYou see a lot of their own brand, a lot of not the cheapest stuff you can buy. We see these conflicts.\u201dOf course in some cases, clients don\u2019t have the opportunity to think something could be wrong. Investments get chosen for them because they are in a discretionary account, even though those investments may not have been selected to minimize fees.Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant, has a series of funds just for clients of its portfolio advisory service. They are called Strategic Advisers funds and open only to people who use Fidelity to manage their money.\u201cAs an investor, you don\u2019t choose that fund,\u201d Nicole Goodnow, a Fidelity spokeswoman, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like an investor comes and says, \u2018I want that income opportunity fund to be part of my portfolio.\u2019 The manager says, \u2018We think you\u2019d be a fit for this fund.\u2019 \u201dAnd that can be a problem.Take the Strategic Advisers Income Opportunities Fund. It gained 13.54 percent in 2016, which put its return slightly above the average for similar funds in its category. But the fund had three of its largest investments in Fidelity funds, including its largest position \u2014 18.48 percent in the Fidelity Capital & Income fund.This Strategic Advisers fund also had large holdings in the more expensive A shares of several funds instead of the cheaper institutional class. The difference sounds like inside baseball, given that the differences are fractions of a percent. But in a low-return environment, those fractions matter, particularly when it is easy to switch from A shares to institutional shares without incurring a tax bill.\u201cPeople are all so good now, so it all comes down to fees: Do we expect to get value in excess of what we\u2019re paying?\u201d said Gary Ribe, chief investment officer of the Macro Consulting Group.The hunt for fees hiding in plain sight \u2014 particularly when investors think a provider is acting in their best interest \u2014 is continuing, exhaustive and dispiriting.Even advisers who act under the fiduciary standard can receive so-called soft dollars from the custodian holding their clients\u2019 money or from mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that want to encourage them to sell more of their fund. The fund may be ideal for clients, but it is the appearance of conflict that calls into question the adviser\u2019s motives.So what should people do? The advice, short of enforceable regulation and industry change, puts the onus on the individual.Michael Krol, chief client service officer at Waldron Private Wealth, which manages $1.4 billion, said that clients needed to hear their advisers say: \u201cThis is the fee you pay me, and none of the advice I give you, none of the products I put you into, are going to result in any greater compensation to me.\u201d\u201cIf the client knows there is no way for me to get paid more,\u201d Mr. Krol added, \u201cthat\u2019s a simple way to avoid that conflict.\u201dThat can work fine at a brokerage firm guided by the less rigorous suitability standard. \u201cIf we happen to engage someone on the brokerage side of the business, I\u2019m very comfortable disclosing how product vendors compensate us,\u201d said Jimmy Lee, chief executive of the Wealth Consulting Group, which is a hybrid adviser and broker through LPL Financial. \u201cI tell them what the commissions are directly from product vendors, and I say the broker-dealer gets a part of the commission that is passed on to us as a registered representative.\u201dBut at the end of the day, fiduciary standard or not, investors are going to need to look more closely at what they own and why they continue to own it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Shepard, Film Preservationist, Dies at 76", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavid Shepard, a film preservationist who restored hundreds of discarded, hidden or forgotten films by masters like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and F. W. Murnau and packaged rarities for the consumer market, died on Jan. 31 in Medford, Ore. He was 76.The cause was cancer, said his brother, Donald.Working for the American Film Institute and later for Blackhawk Films, which reproduced old films for the collectors\u2019 market, Mr. Shepard began searching out movies that had been languishing in studio vaults or private collections and bringing them in for restoration.By trial and error, he developed techniques now used widely in commercial preservation laboratories. In 1989, after acquiring Blackhawk\u2019s library, he created his own company, Film Preservation Associates.\u201cHe was able to build an audience for silent film and keep it going,\u201d Jeffrey Vance, a film historian who has written books on Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd, said in an interview. \u201cHe made silent films available to everyone.\u201dDavid Haspel Shepard was born on Oct. 22, 1940, in Manhattan and grew up, from the age of 11, in Tenafly, N.J. His father, Bertram, was an executive with the Grand Union grocery chain; his mother, the former Marjorie Markley, was a homemaker.He was film crazy from his earliest years, with a connoisseur's bent that his father indulged by taking him to the film programs at the Museum of Modern Art. After buying a 16-millimeter projector at 12, he discovered that film rental companies, hard hit by television, were selling off their stocks, and he began acquiring films for $1 a reel.In junior high and high school, he filmed football games for the coaches to study. In the off-season, he used the camera to make his own films with student actors.Mr. Shepard earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and religion from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., in 1962 and a master\u2019s in American studies from the University of Pennsylvania a year later.He was teaching theater and film at Pennsylvania State University in 1968 when the fledgling American Film Institute hired him to seek out historically significant films from studios and collectors, with the aim of having them donated to the institute for preservation and archiving. In an early coup, he persuaded Paramount Pictures to turn over the 200 silent features it had in storage in Fort Lee, N.J.After five years, he went to work for Blackhawk, in Davenport, Iowa, as head of product development. It was there that he led the project to acquire and restore Chaplin\u2019s Mutual shorts, in which Chaplin\u2019s Little Tramp character evolved from a purely slapstick figure to a rich, comedic personality.In 1977, he married Kimberly Fetter, who had worked with him at Blackhawk. The marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his brother, he is survived by a son, Ben Baker.Pinched by competition from the video market, Blackhawk Films closed in 1987 and offered Mr. Shepard its equipment for scrap value. He bought an industrial building to house it, and to pay off the building he began doing commercial preservation and restoration work. Soon after, he acquired Blackhawk\u2019s film library, which became the basis for Film Preservation Associates. The company worked with distributors like Kino International and Flicker Alley.Many of the titles were released in box sets, including \u201cMasterworks of D. W.

{"Headline": "A Quiet Giant of Investing Weighs In on Trump", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookHe is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of. His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $795 on Amazon, and a new copy sells for as much as $3,500.Perhaps that\u2019s why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump \u2014 and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry \u2014 has quietly become the most sought-after reading material on Wall Street.He is Seth A. Klarman, the 59-year-old value investor who runs Baupost Group, which manages some $30 billion.While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as \u201cThe Oracle of Boston,\u201d where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised.In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing \u201cperilously high valuations.\u201d\u201cExuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from America-first protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers,\u201d he wrote.\u201cPresident Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhile they might be popular, the reason the U.S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don\u2019t work, they actually leave society worse off.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of pro-growth policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump\u2019s stimulus efforts \u201ccould prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors.\u201dAnd he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy\u2019s growth over the long term.\u201cThe Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cThe large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today\u2019s artificially low levels.\u201dMuch of Mr. Klarman\u2019s anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership style. He described it this way: \u201cThe erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound decision-making.\u201dHe also linked this point \u2014 which is a fair one \u2014 to what \u201cTrump style\u201d means for Mr. Klarman\u2019s constituency and others.\u201cThe big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he\u2019s apparently deliberately so; he says it\u2019s part of his plan.\u201dWhile Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, \u201cIf things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst.\u201dMr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner.While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: \u201cHis words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president.\u201dIn his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. \u201cDespite my preference to stay out of the media,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander.\u201dFrom the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund\u2019s money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years.What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election \u2014 about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet \u2014 wrongly so far \u2014 that the stock market would fall; he lost about $1 billion.Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes \u2014 he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s index \u2014 he blamed the influx of money into the industry.\u201cWith any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cNo surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured.\u201dHe continued, \u201cTo many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product.\u201dThe lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity.Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes \u2014 at least that finance geeks will appreciate \u2014 is what he says is the irony that investors now \u201chave gotten excited about market-hugging index funds and exchange traded funds (E.T.F.s) that mimic various market or sector indices.\u201dHe says he sees big trouble ahead in this area \u2014 or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit.\u201cOne of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E.T.F. activity is that it will tend to \u2018lock in\u2019 today\u2019s relative valuations between securities,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote.\u201cWhen money flows into an index fund or index-related E.T.F., the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership),\u201d he wrote. \u201cThus today\u2019s high-multiple companies are likely to also be tomorrow\u2019s, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings.\u201dTo Mr. Klarman, \u201cstocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it.\u201d\u201cThis should give long-term value investors a distinct advantage,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become.\u201dHow Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here\u2019s a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: \u201cIn matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.\u201dThe DealBook column on Tuesday, about the investor Seth A. Klarman, referred incorrectly in some copies to a statement he issued criticizing Donald J. Trump last year. It was related to Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of a judge\u2019s Mexican heritage, not a recording in which Mr. Trump talked about groping women.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Probably a Bad Idea to Sell Stocks Because You Fear Trump", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket Timing\u201cSo should I cash out of the stock market?\u201dThis is the question I\u2019ve heard from several liberal-leaning friends in the last few months. I get a few emails in this vein every time the stock market hits new highs, as it did on Friday.They are worried that the combination of high share prices and an erratic president mean that the only direction for stocks is down. They are considering shifting some of their assets into cash or bonds.The short and safe answer to give them is: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d But there\u2019s also a long answer.Letting one\u2019s political opinions shape investing decisions is a good way to lose money. Whether a given chunk of your savings should be in stocks, bonds or cash depends on your appetite for risk and when you\u2019re going to need that money. It shouldn\u2019t be shaped by whether you love or hate the current occupant of the White House.First, much of the movement in stocks has little to do with what the president of the United States does. It would be silly to credit Bill Clinton with the dot-com boom that took place during his presidency, or to blame George W. Bush for the collapse of it.But even when the action in Washington is driving markets, it is easy to be blinded by your political opinions. The response to the financial crisis by the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve in early 2009 succeeded at ending the recession and setting the United States economy on an expansion that continues to this day.There\u2019s certainly no guarantee that the stock market will continue to rise under the Trump administration. There are ways that the outlook for investors could get better, and also plenty of ways for them to get worse.It\u2019s very likely there will be corporate tax cuts and deregulation, both of which benefit companies\u2019 bottom lines in a pretty direct and measurable way. It is optimism about those policy priorities that has driven the market rally since Election Day. Throw in some extra government spending on the military and public infrastructure, and you have a recipe for speedier growth.Maybe the pragmatic, pro-business figures in the Trump administration will prevail in internal battles, meaning that, whatever you think of the broader policy agenda, there could be boom times for corporate bottom lines.There are, of course, darker possibilities.President Trump could spark a trade war that could turn into a global recession. Military conflict could break out with a major trading partner like China or could disrupt oil supplies in the Middle East. And a small crisis could spiral into something bigger because of Mr. Trump\u2019s seat-of-the-pants management style.Whatever probability you assign to positive and negative outcomes, it\u2019s hard to dispute that the range of possibilities for what the global economy will look like in four years is uncommonly large. All else being equal, more variation in the economic future means that stocks are riskier.It\u2019s also true that by many measures stock valuations are high. Investing $100 in the S.&.P 500 buys only about $4.69 in annual earnings, down from $5.06 before the election. There is always the possibility of a major correction \u2014 something that would be true no matter who was in the Oval Office.If that scares you, your money probably shouldn\u2019t be in the stock market. If you are planning to tap into those investments in the next few years and a 25 percent drop would be devastating, that\u2019s all the more reason to limit your exposure to the market. Stocks tend to offer good long-term returns, but can deliver low or negative returns for many years at a time.Moving money out of stocks because you need it within the next few years and can\u2019t stomach that kind of risk is one thing. But making a move just because you lack confidence in President Trump could be a case of letting ideology trump investing discipline.An earlier version of this article misstated the professional affiliation of Barry Ritholtz.

{"Headline": "Investing in the Pain of Student Debt Is a Tough but Tempting Play", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a college student in the early 1990s, Charles Trafton worked nights at a student-loan collection agency in Boston\u2019s theater district, calling trucking and beauty school dropouts to ask them for money.As a professional investor more than two decades later, he has bet that shares of companies like his former employer will sink, which has become one of his most lucrative investment ideas.\u201cMy experience in call centers, specifically doing collections, I think gave me a huge interest in this space,\u201d said Mr. Trafton, 48, who runs a small investment firm in Andover, Mass., called FlowPoint Capital. \u201cI became fascinated that this is exactly the kind of creative destruction that hedge funds like ours are craving.\u201dIn recent years, FlowPoint has generated fivefold returns through so-called short bets, or wagers in the stock and options market that shares of certain student-loan-related companies will fall, according to company documents. The fund has also made comparable returns from other education-related short trades.It is part of a broader investment theory that inflated stock prices in for-profit college companies, textbook makers, lenders and loan collectors \u2014 all of whom have roles in what Mr. Trafton calls \u201cthe college bubble\u201d of the last seven or eight years \u2014 have a long way to fall.Mr. Trafton isn\u2019t the only market participant who is skeptical of the $1.4 trillion student-loan market. The outspoken hedge-fund manager William A. Ackman has called student debt a big threat to the United States credit markets, saying, \u201cI think that the government\u2019s going to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned last year that student-debt defaults were a looming problem.More recently, some hedge funds \u2014 concerned about default rates and state and federal lawsuits accusing a major student-loan collector of abuses \u2014 have considered shorting shares of the company or its competitors in various ways.But it isn\u2019t an easy trade to execute.For one thing, the relevant stocks are moving in the wrong direction. Shares of companies that deal with student loans, including Navient and SLM Corporation, otherwise known as Sallie Mae, have risen since early November, reflecting expectations that the Trump administration may establish a friendlier regulatory environment for student lenders.The student-loan market also benefits from having an implicit taxpayer backstop. Since the 2008 financial crisis, most loans are carried on the government\u2019s balance sheet, and, because of wage-garnishment capabilities and other aggressive tools for collecting student debts, they are repaid at fairly high rates, making a rash of unpaid debts less likely.And there\u2019s not a ready investment available that would allow one to bet against securities backed by student loans \u2014 no index like the one that hedge fund managers depicted in \u201cThe Big Short\u201d used to bet against mortgages before the crisis.\u201cThere\u2019s always been fervent interest about how to profit off the pain of the student-loan market,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, who oversaw the industry as an assistant director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Now a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, he has fielded many inquiries from investors looking for insight on how the market works.\u201cFor credit-focused hedge funds, they see a trillion-dollar asset class, but have struggled to engage in the same casinolike activities that they were able to on mortgage,\u201d he said.One big hurdle for the would-be shorters is the lack of credit-default swaps, or C.D.S. \u2014 insurance policies that pay a holder when certain slices, or tranches, of a student-loan-backed security go bad. Such swaps were popular before the financial crisis and created fortunes when swaths of mortgage-backed bonds defaulted.But people on Wall Street say a combination of banks\u2019 worries about sullying their reputations by appearing to benefit from the financial struggles of students, the relatively small number of market participants who use complex shorting tools, and the expense of constructing such idiosyncratic trades has made firms reluctant to build the products that hedge funds want.\u201cIf I could have gone to Goldman Sachs \u2018R\u2019 Us and said, \u2018I\u2019ll take a short on this tranche, a short on that tranche,\u2019 I would have done that, all day, every day,\u201d said Taylor Mann, a researcher who has studied the student-loan market in granular detail, over a recent taco dinner in Athens, Tex., near where he lives. \u201cThe day I found out that, no, C.D.S. isn\u2019t available, no, we don\u2019t have any bespoke investment products,\u201d he added, \u201cit was like, \u2018I\u2019ve got to move on.\u2019\u201dMr. Mann is now focused on starting a hedge fund that looks for compelling trades in currencies and stocks, rather than just trades related to student loans. Still, his take on the student-loan market, which he has described in a research paper as an \u201ceducation bubble\u201d backed by \u201cunambiguously toxic\u201d loans, has resonated for some: Mr. Trafton admires his work, and on SumZero, an online platform catering to investment professionals, Mr. Mann\u2019s short recommendations on stocks like Capella Education, Apollo Education and Navient attracted top popularity ratings. (Apollo was recently taken private.)A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said the firm had not created investments to help short student-loan-backed bonds. (Goldman was, however, one of the best-known players in mortgage-backed securities in the years before the financial crisis).A spokesman for Citigroup, another bank historically known for developing products to help short complex bond securities, declined to respond to questions about whether it had done so in the student-loan market.Greg Lippmann, a former Deutsche Bank trader who helped conceive some of the lucrative short transactions on subprime-mortgage securities in the precrisis period, said he now saw a long, or buy-and-hold, opportunity in certain student-loan-backed bonds.\u201cOur view has always been that on a long-term basis, the fundamentals were going to bear out to where the return on these bonds would be strong,\u201d said Mr. Lippmann, the chief investment officer of the New York-based hedge fund LibreMax Capital.While acknowledging that the bond securities he owns have experienced \u201ca bumpier ride than I would have anticipated,\u201d he added that \u201cwe are confident about future returns, so we don\u2019t short them.\u201dEven Mr. Trafton, whose FlowPoint Capital has benefited greatly from its short positions, is also making more optimistic investments. The place he sees the most potential at the moment, he said, is in student payment arrangements called income-share agreements.Under those pacts, FlowPoint pays a portion of the student\u2019s college fees, then is guaranteed a percentage of the student\u2019s future earnings for a predetermined period of years.And with the election of President Trump, who has said he is committed to reducing regulatory burdens for business, and who once owned a majority stake in a for-profit college, the broad picture for student lenders, loan collectors and for-profit colleges could be brighter in the coming years, some analysts and investors say.Under the Trump administration, a decline in federal spending, possibly paired with new opportunities for private-lender involvement, would not be a surprise, said Michael Tarkan, a senior analyst at Compass Point Research who studies student loans.\u201cA lot of people are calling now to buy the stocks as opposed to shorting them,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buffett Asks Big Money: Why Pay High Fees?", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookPoof: $100 billion disappeared.That\u2019s the figure that Warren E. Buffett recently calculated that pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals have lost over the last decade to hedge funds and other money managers that charge sky-high fees.The letter, which ricocheted around Wall Street to the consternation of some and the applause of others, was Mr. Buffett\u2019s most damning assessment of the hedge fund industry to date, and it came amid a growing debate about whether professional money managers are capable of outperforming the stock market on even a semiregular basis.As many investors know, recent failures of these managers to do so has caused all manner of problems \u2014 a devastation that Mr. Buffett described pointedly in his note.\u201cMuch of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany of these funds are woefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performance accompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by local taxpayers.\u201dFor the past several years, Mr. Buffett has told anyone who will listen to avoid attempting to beat the stock market by investing in hedge funds or actively managed funds. Instead, he has counseled buying a low-cost S. & P. 500 index fund. (He has said he plans to advise the trustee of his estate after he dies to invest 90 percent of it in an S. & P. 500 index fund and the rest into government bonds on behalf of his wife.)However, much of the biggest money in the nation hasn\u2019t taken his advice and continues to pay enormous fees for underperformance.In his letter, Mr. Buffett offered an unusually cogent, honest and blunt appraisal of the human behavior that drives individuals with money to avoid index funds \u2014 and their willingness to pay huge fees.\u201cThe wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling, entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote. \u201cTheir money, they feel, should buy them something superior compared to what the masses receive.\u201dHe continued, \u201cThe financial \u2018elites\u2019 \u2014 wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like \u2014 have great trouble meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few thousand dollars.\u201dMr. Buffett said that wealthy individuals get drawn in by consultants selling them big promises. \u201cCan you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S. & P. 500?\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so.\u201dThat advice, Mr. Buffett added, \u201cis often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment \u2018styles\u2019 or current economic trends make the shift appropriate.\u201dMr. Buffett\u2019s index-loving advice may seem counterintuitive coming from a man who is considered the most successful investor in history \u2014 and who became so by actively making individual bets in the market.It also may be hard to square given that millions of people follow Mr. Buffett\u2019s words \u2014 and tens of thousands of them make an annual pilgrimage to Omaha to his annual meeting \u2014 looking for pearls of wisdom that they can use themselves to beat the market.Mr. Buffett has long offered guidance about investing, and he often makes it sound easy. \u201cSuccess in investing doesn\u2019t correlate with I.Q. once you\u2019re above the level of 25,\u201d he once said \u2014 but it seems even he recognizes that some investors who follow his principles may not succeed.\u201cThere are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to outperform the S. & P. over long stretches. In my lifetime, though, I\u2019ve identified \u2014 early on \u2014 only 10 or so professionals that I expected would accomplish this feat,\u201d he wrote.Perhaps Mr. Buffett\u2019s advice is being taken: Last year, according to Morningstar, about $505 billion flooded into index funds and exchange-traded funds; $340 billion was pulled from active money managers.Of course, if everyone buys index funds, what would it do to the market?And therein lies the rub: That inefficiency is where active investors like Mr. Buffett make money. \u201cI\u2019d be a bum on the street with a tin cup if markets were efficient,\u201d Mr. Buffett once said.Still, Mr. Buffett is not convinced the big money will take his advice and buy index funds \u2014 thereby giving up the dream of trying to beat the market.\u201cHuman behavior won\u2019t change,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWealthy individuals, pension funds, endowments and the like will continue to feel they deserve something \u2018extra\u2019 in investment advice. Those advisers who cleverly play to this expectation will get very rich.\u201dMr. Buffett observed: \u201cThis year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else. The likely result from this parade of promises is predicted in an adage: \u2018When a person with money meets a person with experience, the one with experience ends up with the money, and the one with money leaves with experience.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

On top of that, they have a hard time finding a sympathetic ear. \u201cThere is a sense they can\u2019t really tell anyone what they are dealing with, because no one wants to hear about their struggles,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a society, we don\u2019t have the head space to entertain the notion of a billionaire having a bad day.\u201dMr. Klontz\u2019s interest in helping billionaires and others in their income bracket comes from an unlikely place: his own low-income past. \u201cI came from generations of poverty,\u201d said Mr. Klontz, 46.\u201cI wanted to see how they and their families were able to pass down a way of thinking and behaving associated with financial success,\u201d he said of the very rich. \u201cMy goal was to identify how their psychologies differ to help people achieve their financial goals.\u201dThe association was created by financial and mental health professionals who recognized that each group could benefit from the other\u2019s skill set. The association\u2019s members are trying to figure out how to combine those skill sets \u2014 financial and mental health \u2014 while protecting consumers. \u201cLike any other blossoming discipline, there is a lot of groundwork that needs to be done,\u201d Ms. Ford said.Becoming a counselor for the ultrarich was a long journey for Mr. Klontz, who grew up outside Detroit. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his mother, a part-time kindergarten teacher pregnant with his sister at the time, was granted full custody. Although she remarried a few years later to a high school teacher, their economic situation barely improved. Mr. Klontz said they went from being under \u201ctremendous financial strain\u201d to straddling the lower- to middle-class line during the rest of his childhood.Despite earning a doctorate in psychology, he remained financially strapped, graduating with $100,000 in accumulated student loan debt and a lot of anxiety about it.But it was 1999, and many of his friends were making lots of money trading stocks. \u201cI thought: This is what rich people do, so I\u2019ll do this, too,\u201d he said. Mr. Klontz sold his truck for about $7,000, bought a $450 car and threw everything that was left into tech stocks. \u201cIn three months the bubble burst and I lost everything I invested.\u201dRather than blame the market, Mr. Klontz decided to figure out what had caused his behavior. \u201cI went home and interviewed several of my family members about their relationship with money,\u201d he said. \u201cI found stories that blew my mind. But the one that is most salient, is that my grandfather lost all the family\u2019s money in the Great Depression and after that, never put a dollar in a bank again, not for the rest of his life. He died in his 90s, living in a trailer park.\u201dMr. Klontz became interested in learning more about his family\u2019s enormous anxiety around money. His mother, for example, had so much anxiety around it that she put every cent she saved into low-interest-bearing certificates of deposit, rather than the stock market. \u201cI saw these patterns around money in families that I call dysfunctional pendulum swing: You either do exactly what your parents did or the exact opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did: I did the riskiest thing you could do.\u201dAfter his stock market gamble, it took him three years of living extremely close to the bone to pull himself out of debt. The desire to understand the financial beliefs and behaviors of his own, lower-income family led him to dissect the behaviors and beliefs of high-net-worth individuals. And now he works with some of the wealthiest people in the world, many of whom came to him after reading his books or being referred by other clients.Mr. Klontz and his father also repaired their relationship.When Mr. Klontz was 19, his father bought Onsite Workshops, a treatment center in South Dakota, and Mr. Klontz lived with him while getting his master\u2019s degree in counseling; he also worked in his father\u2019s treatment program.And now, after all these years, what, if anything, does Mr. Klontz think psychologically separates the super rich from everyone else \u2014 understanding, of course, that generalizations by nature don\u2019t give a full picture.\u201cIn many ways, I would say they are just like you and I, if we had a billion dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent problems, but not a lack of problems.\u201cThey often have a distorted feedback loop. People are drawn to them for their status and perceived power, so they tend to be surrounded by people who endorse their worldview and don\u2019t challenge their way of thinking. Very few people are honest with them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Individual Investors: Caveat Emptor", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as the horror of President Trump\u2019s immigration ban continues to dominate the news, shadowy outlines of his domestic agenda are beginning to form \u2014 and it is an equally ugly sight.That should have been a no-brainer. Who could be against insisting that stockbrokers and the like apply the same ethical standards as lawyers to how they treat their clients?Answer: Wall Street.The investment community argues that the existing \u201csuitability\u201d standard \u2013 a financial product need only be acceptable as opposed to being in the best interests of the client \u2013 is enough.As the new director of the National Economic Council told The Wall Street Journal on Friday:So if I\u2019m following his analogy, brokers should be allowed to push products onto their clients that they would enjoy buying even if the adviser knows that the investment isn\u2019t in the right thing for the individual.That\u2019s ridiculous. As someone who has spent most of his career on Wall Street, it has long been obvious to me that too many financial advisers convince their clients to buy what makes the adviser the most money, not what would earn the client the highest returns.Investment advisers and their clients have an inherent conflict of interest. Unlike many other professionals, most stockbrokers are paid via commissions. In other words, the more transactions a client undertakes, the more the adviser makes.Additionally, some products \u2013 such as private investments \u2013 generate much higher fees than a simple purchase of some shares in a public company, providing still further divergence of interests.And firms have a vested interest in pushing their own products, even if a competitor\u2019s fund might be the superior performer.In the course of my nearly 35-year Wall Street career, I\u2019ve been shocked at how many of my friends have their savings invested in vehicles with poor performance and high fees.Of course, some of the blame for those deficiencies rests with individuals who believe they are qualified to make investment decisions. Would you do your own appendectomy or rewire your own house?Certainly not. So why would anyone other than an investment professional think they can invest their own money?Whether enablers or perpetrators, Wall Street needs rules like the fiduciary standard to force firms to behave the way they should on their own but obviously aren\u2019t capable of doing.That may make shareholders happy but it should terrify the firm\u2019s customers.Even if the rule is repealed before its scheduled April effective date, some lasting benefit seems likely to endure; a few responsible firms like Merrill Lynch have already begun to implement many of the required changes and say that they will be keeping the changes in place.Americans would be well advised to patronize firms like Merrill that offer accounts in which the client pays an advisory fee based on the size of his assets rather than commissions for each product he buys.That provides good alignment with the wealth manager \u2013 the bigger an account becomes, the more the adviser makes. Be sure to pick a fiduciary to help you.And of course, the best way for Americans to safeguard their retirement assets remains the simplest: Don\u2019t try to actively manage your money and don\u2019t let any adviser do it for you.\u201cBeating the market\u201d is a fool\u2019s game that even most professionals fail at. It\u2019s indisputably desirable to invest in equities, particularly when you are younger, because in the long run, stocks have always outperformed bonds.But please, please, do it through low-cost index funds and don\u2019t ever try to time markets. Even the smartest investors, like Warren Buffett, don\u2019t believe that\u2019s an effective way to grow your nest egg.The shift in our pension system from the employer-based defined benefit plans to 401(k)\u2019s and individual retirement accounts has complicated financial planning for many Americans. Don\u2019t make it harder than it needs to be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Bee Mogul Confronts the Crisis in His Field", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "Beekeeping on an industrial scale is central to American agriculture, and \u201ccolony collapse\u201d has proved to be a severe test.Supported byKERN COUNTY, Calif. \u2014 A soft light was just beginning to outline the Tejon Hills as Bret Adee counted rows of wizened almond trees under his breath.He placed a small white flag at the end of every 16th row to show his employees where they should place his beehives. Every so often, he fingered the buds on the trees. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long,\u201d he said.Mr. Adee (pronounced Ay-Dee) is America\u2019s largest beekeeper, and this is his busy season. Some 92,000 hives had to be deployed before those buds burst into blossom so that his bees could get to the crucial work of pollination.But it is notable that he has a business at all. For the last decade, a mysterious plague has killed billions of bees every year.\u201cEvery year at this time of year, we wonder are there going to be enough bees,\u201d said Bob Curtis, director of agricultural affairs at the Almond Board, a trade group for almond growers.Pollination services, as the bees\u2019 work is known in the industry, has risen this year to between $180 to $200 a hive from an average of $154 a hive in 2006, Mr. Curtis said.There would be no almond crop \u2014 not to mention avocados, apples, cherries and alfalfa \u2014 without honeybees. Of the 100 crops that account for 90 percent of the food eaten around the globe, 71 rely on bee pollination, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.Demand for Mr. Adee\u2019s bees is soaring in part because a poorly understood plague, known as colony collapse, has decimated the nation\u2019s bee population in the last decade. The cause is widely debated: Some cite climate change affecting habitat, others the proliferation of certain pesticides, but most believe the problem has multiple factors.Whatever the reason, in the year that ended in April 2016, 44 percent of the overall commercial bee population died. In a typical year before the plague, only 10 percent to 15 percent would have died, and Mr. Adee\u2019s losses would have been between 3 and 7 percent.This is pollination season for America\u2019s almond trees. As a result, in recent weeks almost two-thirds of the country\u2019s commercial bees have started buzzing through California\u2019s orchards. Some of the bees have been shipped in from as far away as Florida.Adee Honey Farms has some 92,000 hives, each with roughly 40,000 bees, about 3.5 billion bees in total. Most spend the winter here in hives scattered across a 3,000-acre cattle ranch surrounded by low hills with easy access to water, a necessity for such a concentrated population.During pollination season, the bees are loaded onto a dozen flatbed trucks and nine or 10 tractor-trailers and ferried to work, starting first in the almond orchards in late January, then moving to other California crops like broccoli and avocados. About 10 percent of the Adee bees are dispatched to Oregon and Washington State, where they pollinate cherry and apple trees.They work until early May, when the trucks take them to the Midwest for the summer.Like other commercial beekeepers struggling with the population decline, Mr. Adee has stayed afloat, in part, by acquiring the colonies of other beekeepers: The number of commercial beekeepers (those with more than 300 hives) has dropped, though no one is certain by how many.He has also been forced to split his colonies to rebuild his stocks, a process that entails moving some bees out of one colony and fooling them into building colonies around new queens.Nonetheless, his losses were so high last year that he had to borrow bees to fulfill his contracts. This year, thanks in part to the acquisition another beekeeper\u2019s business, he had bees still waiting for work as he deployed his hives across California in late January.He attributes this year\u2019s relative good fortune to the decline last summer of soy aphids, a tiny, translucent, invasive insect from Asia that devastates soybean crops in America. Fewer of the pests meant that many soybean farmers in South Dakota delivered only one application of the pesticide known as neonicotinoids, Mr. Adee said, and the spraying occurred before the arrival of his bees. (Adee bees spend the summer in North and South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota, and Kelvin Adee raises queen bees in Texas and Mississippi.)Neonicotinoids are a class of insecticides that are widely used to kill off aphids and other bugs. Some studies tie them to the declining health of bees and a drop in the populations of birds that depend on those insects for food. In 2013, the European Union and several countries in other areas placed limits on the use of those insecticides.\u201cThe more you study it, the more obvious it becomes: the relationship between the pesticides that have been sprayed everywhere over the last 10 years and what\u2019s happening to bees,\u201d Mr. Adee said.Not that he blames any one thing for the problem. Rather, it is that comprehensive research is rarely done, which, he said, would implicate a variety of factors.James Frazier, a bee expert at Pennsylvania State University, agreed. The bee shortage has to do with the overall health of bees, and not one or two specific things. Bees are exposed to a variety of pesticides, all of which can affect their immune systems, he said. That in turn makes them less resistant to diseases and parasites carried by the varroa mite and enables the spread of viruses.\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than trying to cure cancer,\u201d Dr. Frazier said, \u201cbecause bees are outside, where you have all these uncontrollable things working on them.Bees from one keeper are mixing with those from other populations as their numbers fall. That may aid in the spread of diseases and parasites, said Ann Bartuska, the acting under secretary for research, education and economics at the Agriculture Department.\u201cThere is no smoking gun,\u201d Dr. Bartuska said. \u201cWe still are trying to tease out what combination of factors really leads to beehive health declines.\u201dAdee Honey Farms was started by Vernon Adee, Mr. Adee\u2019s grandfather, during the Great Depression after he received a letter from his brother in Missouri that read: \u201cI can\u2019t sell chickens or hogs, but I\u2019m doing well with honey. Be advised: Get a beehive.\u201dVernon Adee and his son, Richard, raised bees for honey production only. But as that business began to suffer from competition from Chinese and Latin American honey producers, Bret Adee and his brother Kelvin, sons of Richard Adee, figured they needed to develop another business to keep the company afloat.So in 1990, Bret Adee and his wife, Connie, packed their two children (they now have four) into a truck loaded with beehives and moved to Bakersfield, Calif. Today, the pollination business provides two-thirds of the company\u2019s revenue and all of its profits, Mr. Adee said.Because of imported honey, \u201cThere\u2019s no money in honey any more,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, his daughter Elizabeth has started selling the family\u2019s honey in farmers\u2019 markets, a tactic she hopes will help revive that portion of the business.When the Adees arrived in Bakersfield in 1990, there were 411,000 acres of farmland planted with almond trees, according to the Agriculture Department. Since then, the number of acres of almond trees has more than doubled, and growers have adopted techniques that are less bee-friendly.Growers previously flooded their orchards with warm water in the early spring to prevent frost from killing the buds. The water gave rise to grasses and weeds like dandelions and wild vetch between the rows of trees, giving the bees a source of pollen before the buds burst into bloom.But now, growers aim to conserve water, and because weeds and grasses can trap cool air that can lead to frost, most almond ranchers spray herbicides to keep the rows between their trees free of unwanted growth.To safeguard his bees, Mr. Adee\u2019s employees lay a pad made of yeast, sugar and other nutrients under the lid of a hive to give the bees something to eat before the trees bloom.He also scouts out areas close to uncultivated land or grazing areas with water nearby. His bees spent last fall and early winter in hives scattered about a ranch ringed by the foothills of the Diablo Range and close to aqueducts and other water sources. \u201cThey\u2019re far away from anything bad for them,\u201d he said.At the ranch, cattle lazily grazed in the evening amid neatly stacked clusters of hives, looking on curiously when flatbed trucks pulled into load the bees for overnight journeys.The deployment of bees resembles a military operation, with Mr. Adee serving as its commander. Hives must be loaded onto trucks in the evening, four hives at a time on pallets precariously balanced on a forklift. Each truck transports 216 hives over dirt roads that, thanks to this season\u2019s rain, were deeply rutted and thick with mud.The Adee bees rent for $200 a hive. On average, Mr. Adee places two hives per acre of almond trees. A 4,500-acre almond orchard would require about 9,000 hives, although growers are free to specify the number of hives they want.Commercial beekeepers are a tight-knit group, and most new contracts come as referrals from other beekeepers and clients. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a grapevine,\u201d Mr. Adee said. \u201cIf you have to advertise, then you\u2019re not much of a beekeeper.\u201dDuring pollination season, he typically leaves home at 5:30 a.m. and heads for an orchard or field to map the day\u2019s plan. He relies on two thermoses of coffee to keep him going.Placing flags to mark the spots in orchards where hives are to be placed gives Mr. Adee a chance to survey the terrain. If a row of trees happens to have a low spot, he will place a flag a few rows away to ensure the hives do not stand in water. If his pickup slips in the mud, he makes a call to warn drivers not to take their much heavier equipment down the same path.Mr. Adee marks plot maps with neon Sharpies, using a different color to indicate which crew is to deliver which bees to a particular spot.After setting his crews in action \u2014 roughly 100 employees during pollination season, Mr. Adee then makes a second and sometimes a third round of deliveries to orchards, stopping occasionally to right a hive or gently squeeze the tips of branches to gauge when they might bud. He then has an idea when his bees might need to be fed again.Between stops, he talks on the phone \u2014 when his cell gets a signal, that is. In one call, he spoke to his foreman about two trucks needing repair.Then he called an independent trucker to see if he could move bees that night, diplomatically sidestepping the man\u2019s request that he also hire a friend. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t know until tonight what\u2019s needed,\u201d Mr. Adee said.After that, he called a lawyer, seeking counsel for a beekeeper who had lost his bees after the ranch across the street sprayed an organophosphate. \u201cIt was an illegal application, and the county knows it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the county is dragging its feet. He needs some help.\u201dIn 2006, David Hackenberg, another beekeeper with a large bee collection, lost 90 percent of them and coined the term colony collapse. Mr. Adee had no such problem that year. I in the documentary made that year, \u201cThe Vanishing of the Bees,\u201d he can be heard saying,\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any of this colony-collapse disorder here.\u201dShortly after the film came out, though, he also lost almost all the family\u2019s bees.\u201cStill, I was convinced my problem was a virus, not what David had,\u201d Mr. Adee said. \u201cI thought it would take three years for it to run its course, and then we\u2019d be done with it.\u201dBut the losses stretched on, into a fourth and then fifth year. Last year, after having lost roughly half of his 90,000 hives, he joined Mr. Hackenberg, other beekeepers and environmental groups in a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency.The suit contends that the E.P.A. broke the law by failing to require registration of seeds coated in pesticides, as many genetically engineered seeds are. \u201cE.P.A.\u2019s actions and inactions have caused both acute honeybee kills and chronic effects leading to excess bee colony mortality, excess bird mortality, nationwide water and soil contamination, and other environmental and economic harms,\u201d the plaintiffs argued.There is no federal insurance program to cover beekeepers. The federal 2008 Farm Bill did allocate $50 million in emergency assistance to cover losses in livestock, farm-raised fish and honeybees, but only through 2011.A year later, the Agriculture Department estimated that beekeepers had spent $2 billion to replace the 10 million hives they had lost in the six years since bee colonies first began experiencing declines.Here, the almond trees are just beginning to bloom. Mr. Adee\u2019s bees work alongside their boss, who is working the phones.Someone on the phone asked him to address a matter that had nothing to do with his bees. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have time for that,\u201d Mr. Adee said. \u201cOr rather, I know I don\u2019t have time.\u201dAn article last Sunday about challenges in the beekeeping industry referred imprecisely to the insect that was scheduled to be listed under the Endangered Species Act on Feb. 10. It is the rusty patched bumblebee, not \u201cthe bumblebee.\u201d The article also misidentified the substance that the beekeeper Bret Adee said had been sprayed near a peer\u2019s bees. It was organophosphate, not organic phosphate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buffett\u2019s $1 Trillion Target for Apple Is in Sight", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsWarren Buffett\u2019s $1 trillion target for the iPhone maker Apple is in sight. Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway boss, has bought more stock in Apple \u2014 whose market capitalization at Friday\u2019s closing price was $717 billion \u2014 and reckons it may become the first company with a 13-digit valuation. Breakingviews first suggested that back in 2011. Growth has slowed, but the company still looks undervalued.The tech giant, led by Timothy D. Cook, now trades at about 15 times estimated earnings for its financial year to September 2017. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index trades at about 19 times projected earnings for the same period. Moreover, Apple has nearly $250 billion of cash and equivalents, such a huge pot that most of it is invested in long-term securities \u2014 a category excluded from standard cash and net debt calculations.The quantum and treatment are so unusual that it is worth valuing Apple and its hoard of ready money separately. Put the company\u2019s underlying business on the same price-to-earnings multiple as the S.&P. and it is worth around $850 billion. Add back cash, net of the company\u2019s almost $90 billion of debt, and the company\u2019s potential market cap tops $1 trillion.Investors worry that the global smartphone market is saturated. Analysts think Apple\u2019s revenue will increase at a fairly modest 6 percent this financial year. However, as Mr. Buffett noted on CNBC on Monday, the company\u2019s products are \u201csticky,\u201d meaning most customers stay with the brand when they replace their phones. Services like apps, online data storage, payments and music are steadily growing. Heavy investment in developing new products may yet produce another Apple hit, too.There is also the concern that Apple will make big, overpriced acquisitions. Yet there is no evidence for this. Mr. Cook is stingy \u2014 the company\u2019s largest acquisition in 40 years was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014. It pays out roughly that amount every quarter in dividends, and on average about three times as much in buybacks.Perhaps investors simply can\u2019t get their heads around such a big number. If so, that could also be an issue for Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company Aramco, which is working toward floating an offering with a possible valuation of $2 trillion. It wouldn\u2019t take much of a shift in investors\u2019 attitude to get Apple to the $1 trillion mark first.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Valeant Stake, Still Unresolved Questions for Activist Investor", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneThe so-called Trump Bump, the stock market rally that has unexpectedly ignited the Dow Jones industrial average to soar close to 21,000 since President Trump\u2019s election, has swept up in its powerful force lots of stocks, especially those of Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which are at, or near, record highs.Valeant has had a very rough 18 months or so: several management changes at the top; scandals involving Philidor, its specialty pharmacy subsidiary (two executives were indicted in November); and the scrutiny of a congressional panel on its practice, not unique in the industry, of driving up the prices of lifesaving drugs.What was once a market darling, favored by the best and brightest hedge fund managers, has fallen on some hard times. In August 2015, the stock reached over $260. Just a few months before hitting that milestone, Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square, worth roughly $11 billion, had poured some $3.2 billion into Valeant\u2019s stock, at an average price of around $190 per share. Pershing Square still owns around 18.1 million shares, a 5.3 percent stake, currently worth about $301 million. At its peak, Mr. Ackman\u2019s stake in Valeant was worth around $4 billion.At first, Mr. Ackman\u2019s involvement with Valeant made him look like a genius. But it also raised serious \u2014 and still unresolved \u2014 questions that could come back to haunt him.In February 2014, a Pershing Square colleague introduced Mr. Ackman to J. Michael Pearson, Valeant\u2019s chief executive at the time. They soon agreed to a partnership through which Pershing Square would back Valeant\u2019s hostile bid for Allergan, the maker of Botox. Armed with the knowledge that Valeant intended to make an unsolicited bid, Mr. Ackman spent $3.2 billion to buy a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan. He agreed to vote those shares for the Valeant deal.Had he not reached an agreement with Valeant, , Mr. Ackman could have sold his stake and joined a class-action shareholder lawsuit. That, of course, would have been bad news for both Mr. Ackman, who would have perfected his loss in Valeant, and for Valeant, which would have to watch nearly helplessly as its largest shareholder sold millions of shares into the market, the consequence of which would most likely have been to drive Valeant\u2019s stock price down even further. Both sides had the incentive to avoid that outcome.For now, as a result of the agreement with Valeant, both Mr. Ackman and Stephen Fraidin, Pershing Square\u2019s vice chairman, still hold seats on Valeant\u2019s board of directors, presumably where they can continue to try to salvage the hedge fund\u2019s worst-performing investment. It won\u2019t be easy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Offshore Wind Moves Into Energy\u2019s Mainstream", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIVERPOOL, England \u2014 When engineers faced resistance from residents in Denmark over plans to build wind turbines on the Nordic country\u2019s flat farmland, they found a better locale: the sea. The offshore wind farm, the world\u2019s first, had just 11 turbines and could power about 3,000 homes.That project now looks like a minnow compared with the whales that sprawl for miles across the seas of Northern Europe.Off this venerable British port city, a Danish company, Dong Energy, is installing 32 turbines that stretch 600 feet high. Each turbine produces more power than that first facility.It is precisely the size, both of the projects and the profits they can bring, that has grabbed the attention of financial institutions, money managers and private equity funds, like the investment bank Goldman Sachs, as well as wealthy individuals like the owner of the Danish toymaker Lego. As the technology has improved and demand for renewable energy has risen, costs have fallen.And offshore wind, once a fringe investment, with limited scope and reliant on government subsidies, is moving into the mainstream. Europe, too, looks all the more attractive, as the United States under President Trump rethinks its stance on renewables.\u201cIf you had polled infrastructure investors five years ago, only a few would have been looking at offshore wind,\u201d said Suzanne Buchta, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch global co-head of green bonds.Now, she said, they \u201care a little more comfortable.\u201dOffshore wind has several advantages over land-based renewable energy, whether wind or solar. Turbines can be deployed at sea with fewer complaints than on land, where they are often condemned as eyesores.But the technology had been expensive and heavily dependent on government subsidies, leaving investors wary. That is now changing.Turbines today are bigger, produce much more electricity and are deployed on much larger sites than in the past. The result is more clean power and extra revenue.The number of major players has also expanded, creating more competition. A joint venture of Vestas, the Danish turbine maker, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan, is now competing with Siemens, which had long dominated the market for building offshore turbines. Others, like the American giant General Electric and Chinese manufacturers, are also jumping into the game.\u201cFor us competition is great,\u201d said Benj Sykes, Britain country manager for Dong. \u201cIt drives innovation. It drives performance. It also drives cost.\u201dCompanies are developing specialized vessels and improving installation techniques (taking a cue from the oil industry), cutting construction timetables. Dong and its competitors are learning to better cope with the bad weather, corrosive saltwater and scouring currents that increase costs.The first offshore wind facility, Vindeby, began generating electricity in 1991. Frank A. Olsen, the Danish executive who led its construction, recalls that it was built using a barge with a crane mounted on a truck. Dong\u2019s Burbo Bank Extension off Liverpool is far more advanced. In the distance, a ship lays electric cable, while a small fleet of other vessels about 80 feet long bobbed on the swell as maintenance crews finished their work.All of those factors in concert have helped push costs down. Dong says its anticipated costs of electricity generation have halved. As recently as 2014, they were 156 euros, or $166, per megawatt-hour, a wholesale unit of electricity, on a British project. By last year, they had fallen to \u20ac78 per megawatt-hour on a series of wind farms off the Netherlands.Those falling prices have raised hopes that offshore wind can soon compete with conventional power sources like natural gas and, eventually, do without subsidies.Offshore is \u201con the cusp of a new world,\u201d said Samuel Leupold, Dong\u2019s executive vice president for wind.The industry is not without challenges. Governments have been cutting financial support for clean power in a bid to balance their budgets, while President Trump\u2019s administration seems likely, based on his promises during his election campaign, to forcefully support fossil fuels.Planned mega-projects that will dwarf the Burbo Bank Extension will test whether investors still see renewables as an attractive investment and whether Europe will retain a leadership role when it comes to green energy in the Trump era.For now, offshore wind is a relatively small industry, albeit one that is growing fast.It currently accounts for less than a tenth of installations of new wind capacity around the world.Offshore wind \u201chas been an area of great interest to us,\u201d said Carol Gould, the head of power and renewables for Europe at MUFG, a Japanese bank that is backing a separate giant wind farm off Britain, among other projects.With interest rates in the Western world at historic lows, investors have been attracted by offshore wind\u2019s higher returns. And, with projects that have lifetimes of 15 years or more, those returns are long-lasting as well.PensionDanmark, a Danish pension provider, has invested more than \u20ac1.6 billion in equity stakes in offshore wind projects and expects returns of 6 percent to 9 percent, said Torben Moger Pedersen, the chief executive.Those rewards reflect the substantial risks.Basically, they are investing in power plants and face myriad potential issues: storms, construction problems, severed power cables, fluctuations in electricity prices and even the chance that governments may not honor promises. Four years ago, the discovery of tons of unexploded munitions along a cable route led to costly delays for a German offshore wind farm.For a company like Dong, which builds and in many cases operates the wind farms, the risks are amplified. Unlike investors, who are a step removed from the process, it also expects higher returns.The company could earn about 12 percent from the Burbo Bank Extension, according to Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein Research in London. The estimates are based on projections of Dong\u2019s construction and operating costs, as well as the revenue it will gain from selling the electricity. The company declined to comment on the profitability of individual projects.Dong, whose name is an acronym of Danish Oil and Natural Gas, has managed to attract a wide range of top investors.Goldman Sachs holds a large stake in the company itself, but several other companies, individuals and funds have taken stakes in its many projects and more are in the works \u2014 a giant new facility off the English coast known as Hornsea 1 will dwarf the Burbo Bank Extension.Dong sold 25 percent stakes in the Burbo Bank Extension to PKA, a Danish pension fund, and Kirkbi, the investment vehicle of the Kristiansen family, which owns Lego.Its other facilities have obtained cash from the likes of E.On of Germany and Centrica of Britain. Masdar, the clean energy company owned by oil-rich Abu Dhabi, and the Japanese trading house Marubeni have also committed money.The increasing variety of investors looking to join is a major shift from a quarter-century ago.\u201cOffshore makes sense as the next frontier,\u201d said Jonathan Levy, head of policy and strategy for Vision Ridge Partners, an investment firm based in Colorado.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With No Frills and No Commissions, Robinhood App Takes On Big Brokerages", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the app\u2019s hype and surging popularity, some industry experts question if the free-trades business model can survive, or if it will wind up joining other start-ups that have crashed and burned. The company currently makes money primarily from interest on customer cash balances.At Robinhood, there is no minimum deposit to register an account, and there are no trading fees for customers who buy and sell United States-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. To keep costs down, the company, in Palo Alto, Calif., takes a no-frills approach. It has no storefront offices. It does not provide research reports, analytical tools, stock screening gizmos or options trading on its platform.\u201cUber opened our eyes that if you could hail a car off your phone and watch movies, why can\u2019t I trade 10 shares of Facebook or a thousand shares?\u201d said Howard Lindzon, a general partner of the Social Leverage Fund and a founder of StockTwits, a financial communications platform. His fund holds an equity stake in Robinhood.Chase Kaye, a 21-year-old Manhattan resident, signed up for Robinhood over a year ago after he grew tired of paying the $7 commission on trades at the Vanguard Group.\u201cThe interface on the phone app is way better,\u201d said Mr. Kaye, a marketing management student at Baruch College. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, not as intimidating and very intuitive.\u201d Today about 70 percent of his assets are with Robinhood, Mr. Kaye said.Still, nothing is truly free in the world of finance.Even the name conjures up images of a firm helping the poor, when it may actually be doing the opposite, he contends.Robinhood\u2019s founders dispute these concerns. Their goal is to make investing accessible to everyone, not just the superwealthy, which is why the name Robinhood was chosen, said Vladimir Tenev, 30, a founder.\u201cWe have active investors who are moving their trading over from other brokerages where they have paid thousands to tens of thousands of dollars in trading commissions,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. \u201cWe also have younger customers who are accumulating stocks and building mini diversified portfolios over time.\u201dA customer could buy one share in a stock or ETF today and five more shares next month to slowly build a portfolio. The fees at larger firms would make such a strategy cost prohibitive. Big brokerage firms like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, Fidelity and E-Trade typically charge $7 to $10 a trade.Robinhood\u2019s bare-bones business model has led to complaints about its customer service, with long waiting times by phone and emails that are not answered. Internet blogs are also filled with complaints about lengthy waits \u2014 up to eight days \u2014 to transfer money from a Robinhood account to a bank or vice versa. Mr. Tenev said the company was looking to solve these problems.And some customers are frustrated that the company doesn\u2019t offer options trading, a website trading platform or automated transfers from other brokerage accounts. Mr. Tenev said that would change. \u201cIf you look down several years, we\u2019ll offer all of these things,\u201d he said.Robinhood is the brainchild of Mr. Tenev and Baiju Prafulkumar Bhatt, Stanford graduates who shared a passion for math and physics. In 2009 they moved to New York, where they began Celeris and Chronos Research, which made high-frequency trading software for hedge funds and banks.Inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, they rethought their priorities. \u201cThe financial services industry should serve all people, regardless of net worth,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. In 2012, they moved back to California, hired engineers and spent the next 18 months building Robinhood.In late 2013, Robinhood set up a beta version and invited people to test the app. When the sign-up page was posted on Hacker News and Reddit, the site was flooded with requests.\u201cWe had almost 50,000 people that signed up that first weekend,\u201d Mr. Bhatt, 32, recalled. By the time the app began in the App Store in late 2014, it had a wait-list of a million people, most under the age of 30.The company has raised $66 million in start-up cash from such high-flying investors as Andreessen Horowitz, GV, Index Ventures and New Enterprise Associates, as well as entertainers like Jared Leto, Snoop Dogg and Nas.In addition to cash balances, the company makes money from \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d which refers to the money it receives for selling its orders to market makers to be executed.\u201cThese revenue streams alone are not enough to sustain an online broker providing $0 trades \u2014 not even close,\u201d said Blain Reinkensmeyer, the head of broker research at StockBrokers.com.Recently, Robinhood introduced a Gold program, which offers margin accounts and after-hours trading, for a fee.\u201cRobinhood Gold is where we anticipate the bulk of the revenues to come from in the future,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. Robinhood charges Gold accounts a fixed monthly fee that works out to 5 to 6 percent interest on margin accounts, whether the customer uses the credit line or not. At larger firms, like Schwab, customers are charged interest only on the margin amount that\u2019s used.\u201cI got the email to sign up for a free month trial of their new Gold account, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in,\u201d Mr. Kaye said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably stay with Vanguard for margin accounts.\u201dAnother firm, Zecco, attempted a similar \u201cfree trades\u201d model in 2006. Despite raising more than $35 million in financing, the company struggled to get off the ground, and eventually merged with TradeKing in 2012. It now charges $4.95 a trade.\u201cZecco couldn\u2019t find a path to profitability without charging for commissions and evolving into a traditional online broker,\u201d Mr. Reinkensmeyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly history is forgotten.\u201dMr. Lindzon, the Robinhood equity investor, noted that Zecco operated when smartphone use was in its infancy.\u201cWith a couple billion people now on smartphones, it\u2019s a very different market today,\u201d said Aaron Levie, a founder of the cloud company Box, and another of Robinhood\u2019s equity investors.Other start-ups have entered the territory to challenge Robinhood. They include Ustocktrade, which charges a $1-a-month membership fee and offers $1 trades, and Loyal3, which offers no-fee trades on a limited number of stocks, partial shares and initial public offerings. There\u2019s also Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Edge, which offers 30 free stock and ETF trades each month for customers with a balance of at least $50,000 and 100 free trades a month on balances of at least $100,000.So far, the big brokerage firms do not appear concerned about Robinhood. Kim Hillyer, a spokesman for TDAmeritrade, said investors value a full-service firm that offers free education, webinars, research tools and investment consultants in addition to a full trading platform that includes futures and options. She noted that TDAmeritrade accounts have continued to grow since Robinhood\u2019s introduction, rising to seven million in fiscal 2016 from 6.3 million in 2014. \u201cThe growth in new accounts is a validation for the value proposition that we have,\u201d she said.Erin Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Schwab, agreed. \u201cWe know that investors and traders alike are looking for value from their brokerage firms, and our clients find that here,\u201d she said. The firm\u2019s investment services and products include financial planning and research as well as a full trading platform and commission-free ETFs.Still, the two firms said they are always looking for ways to stay competitive, and sometimes offer low-fee and no-fee trading promotions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Endowment Sweepstakes: How Tiny Houghton College Beat Harvard", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThe hotly competitive returns of college endowment performance are out, and the results have again shaken the higher education elite down to their Ivy League roots: The smallest endowments \u2014 those with total assets under $25 million \u2014 outperformed their billion-dollar-plus rivals for the second year.The National Association of College and University Business Officers, known as Nacubo, and the Commonfund Institute last week released the latest results, which are, for most schools, far more important than whether they advance to the N.C.A.A. Final Four.The 2016 fiscal year, which ended June 30, wasn\u2019t an especially good year for anybody. But the smallest endowments outperformed the billion-plus group, losing 1 percent, on average, compared with a 1.9 percent decline for the biggest endowments.Results were even worse for endowments of $500 million to $1 billion, which lost on average 2.2 percent.Houghton emerged in the top quartile of all endowments, according to Nacubo, with a return of 11.85 percent for the year ended Sept. 30. (Houghton uses a different fiscal year.) For the calendar year, the results were also impressive, at 7.45 percent. Houghton has been able to lower its spending rate \u2014 the amount it withdraws each year to fund operations \u2014 to an enviable 4.5 percent, and may be able to lower it further, to 4 percent.How did tiny Houghton do it?The answer is pretty simple: Houghton got out of hedge funds and all alternative investments a year and a half ago, and moved the entire portfolio to a mix of low-cost index funds and mutual funds at the fund giant Vanguard.Houghton\u2019s investment committee met this week, and is likely to move even further from active management, Mr. Morris said. \u201cI went to the University of Chicago, where I sat in a lot of investment classes,\u201d he told me. He learned how difficult it was for active managers to outperform market averages, \u201cespecially year after year,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in passive investment.\u201dAs for hedge funds and other high-cost alternatives, \u201cthe whole two-and-20 model\u201d \u2014 in which investors typically pay 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gains \u2014 \u201cis ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Morris said. \u201cThe cost structure is outrageous. As they say on Wall Street, \u2018Where are the customers\u2019 yachts?\u2019 I\u2019m not going to play that game.\u201dHoughton\u2019s experience with hedge funds predates Mr. Morris\u2019s arrival on campus, but their performance was \u201cmediocre at best,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe investment committee and I are on the same page about moving to less active management and lower costs.\u201dAs Houghton\u2019s experience suggests, the past year\u2019s disparity in results between the large and small endowments can almost entirely be explained by the differing allocations to alternative investments, especially hedge funds.According to the association\u2019s survey, endowments larger than $1 billion had 58 percent of their assets in alternative strategies on average, with 20 percent in hedge funds and 12 percent in private equity.The smallest endowments \u2014 those of less than $25 million \u2014 had just 10 percent in alternatives, with 6 percent in hedge funds and a mere 1 percent in private equity.Stung by overexposure to the troubled pharmaceutical company Valeant International, and taken by surprise by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, hedge funds, on average, lagged far behind both the S.&P. 500 and fixed-income returns in fiscal 2016.As a result, the performance of a simple low-cost mix of stocks and bonds, much like the portfolio Houghton assembled, has streaked past the more complex portfolios laden with hedge funds and other alternative investments.Vanguard said a simple mix of index funds with 70 percent in equities and 30 percent in fixed-income assets delivered an annualized return of 7.1 percent over the past five years, and 6.1 percent over the past 10. For a mix of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, the returns were 6.7 percent for five years and 6.1 percent for 10.By comparison, the annualized returns for the billion-plus endowments were 6.1 percent for five years and 5.7 percent for 10.Hedge funds, however, have successfully marketed themselves as offering higher risk-adjusted rates of return, in part because they supposedly minimize losses in down years. But according to Vanguard\u2019s calculations, its simple, low-cost model portfolios have provided higher returns even after adjusting for risk in eight of the past 11 years.Most investors \u201cwould have been much better off in a low-cost, broadly diversified portfolio than in these other complex vehicles,\u201d Christopher Philips, head of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services, said.Harvard reported its hedge fund portfolio lost 1.2 percent for the 2016 fiscal year. The university said it had 14 percent of its assets in \u201cabsolute return\u201d strategies \u2014 meant to ensure that the return is always positive, rather than pegged to a benchmark \u2014 a category that includes hedge funds.Nonetheless, in a report written by the previous chief executive of Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university\u2019s endowment, Harvard said that \u201cwe continue to believe that partnering with best-in-class managers will lead to attractive risk-adjusted returns.\u201dWhy Harvard would harbor such a belief after years of hedge fund underperformance remains a mystery to some.\u201cSupposedly the big endowments have access to better managers,\u201d Mr. Morris said. \u201cI may be more cynical, but I\u2019m not sure I buy that. How do you know who the better managers are? I\u2019m not convinced that any manager can outperform\u201d over the long-term horizons of most endowments.Mr. Philips of Vanguard agreed. \u201cThe ultimate challenge is picking the hedge fund managers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many, you end up seeing the same distribution of returns that you see in mutual funds except there are twice as many hedge funds.\u201dMr. Narvekar has already shaken up the endowment\u2019s management, saying Harvard will lay off roughly half its 230 employees by the end of the next fiscal year, including all of its internal hedge fund managers. He promised to outsource more of the endowment\u2019s investment decisions.Even so, no one expects Harvard \u2014 or any other major endowment \u2014 to ditch hedge funds anytime soon. Hope springs eternal, and the allure of potentially higher returns is paradoxically more potent the lower the actual returns are.\u201cIf I put myself in the shoes of an endowment manager, I can sympathize,\u201d Mr. Philips said. \u201cYou have to keep ahead of inflation and contribute to the operating budget at a time when return expectations are muted. So you feel compelled to reach for hedge funds or private equity in the hope you\u2019ll outperform.\u201dWhile Vanguard hasn\u2019t seen any stampede out of hedge funds and other alternatives among college endowments, \u201cthose hopes are starting to come up against reality,\u201d Mr. Philips said.The Common Sense column on Feb. 10 discussed the investing success of endowments at small colleges compared with those at larger institutions. The column cited Houghton College, in western New York, which reported an investment return of 11.85 percent for the year ended Sept. 30. Because that period was different from the one reported by other colleges, however, the column did not give a clear picture of Houghton\u2019s relative performance. In a more comparable period \u2014 from August 2015 (when Houghton changed investment managers) to June 2016 (the end of year reported by most other colleges) \u2014 its return for 10 \u00bd months was 2.98 percent. The column also misstated, using information from the college, the return for the calendar year. It was 7.45 percent, not 7.54 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Who Lives by the Stock Market Rally \u2026", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsSteven Mnuchin\u2019s stock-market brag could turn out to be a double-edged sword. The new Treasury secretary says the postelection rally in the equities market reflects faith in President Trump and his promises for tax changes and fiscal stimulus. Both plans need approval from Congress, and may be accompanied by higher inflation. Anti-immigrant and trade policies could also mute market gains.Secretary Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday that he hoped to have a tax-overhaul bill passed by Congress by August. That is an ambitious timetable, even with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House. There are major differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate, which will most likely come up with a separate proposal. One senator said current House tax proposals would be lucky to draw 10 votes out of 100. The administration will use its own rosy growth forecasts rather than the Congressional Budget Office estimates on which lawmakers rely.Congress already has a full agenda. Its first priority is repealing and replacing Obamacare, but lawmakers have yet to present a plan as disagreements continue. The Senate is also considering Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, who needs 60 votes to beat a filibuster. Republicans are eight votes shy of that number. Lawmakers are already considering pushing President Trump\u2019s plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure to next year, and Secretary Mnuchin did not highlight it on Thursday.Yet investors betting on a fiscal stimulus and tax overhaul have pushed the S.&P. 500-stock index up by more than 10 percent since the November election. Secretary Mnuchin said the performance reflected confidence in President Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cThis is a mark-to-market business, and you see what the market thinks,\u201d he said.Carrying out President Trump\u2019s campaign pledges could spur inflation, which is already creeping up. Consumer spending has been healthy, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported last week that inflation expectations hit 1.92 percent. That is still shy of the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target but higher than the 1.6 percent reported at the end of December. Rising inflation could put the Fed on a quicker path for raising interest rates.While action on taxes and infrastructure remains iffy, President Trump\u2019s concrete moves to crack down on immigration and pull out of trade deals will hit the economy. When stock prices fall, as stock prices do, Secretary Mnuchin may find claiming credit for the market\u2019s rise was a risk not worth taking.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Look Past Headlines as Bull Market Roars Ahead", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkets hate uncertainty. It is one of the oldest saws in finance.Yet even as a series of political scandals flare up in President Trump\u2019s nascent administration, raising questions about his ability to pursue an investor-friendly agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal spending, the stock market just roars ahead.For the most part, the stumbles by the administration have not been related to promises that Mr. Trump made \u2014 and that investors embraced \u2014 to recharge an economy that most economists believe is growing at subpar levels.Still, that investors have chosen to ignore the chaos in Washington highlights just how deep is the belief (others might consider it wishful thinking) that Mr. Trump, at his root, is a president who will deliver market-friendly policies.\u201cI fully get the euphoria \u2014 there has probably never been a more business-friendly president,\u201d said Adrian Helfert, the head of global fixed income at Amundi Smith Breeden. \u201cLower taxes and less regulations are good for corporations and equity holders.\u201dSince Election Day, the S.&P. 500 index is up over 9 percent, and with money continuing to pour into stocks from bond and money market funds, the bull market is showing few signs of letting up.On Wednesday, stocks continued their run for a seventh consecutive session \u2014 the longest winning streak since September 2013, according to Bloomberg data. The S.&P. 500 gained 0.5 percent, led by health care and financial stocks.But as the markets climb and corporate borrowing rates remain historically low, Mr. Helfert worries that investors are taking too lightly the possible pitfalls of this high-risk, high-return Trump presidency.\u201cHe is pulling out all the stops,\u201d he said, \u201cand I just don\u2019t think that investors are being compensated for the downside risks.\u201dMr. Helfert points to the VIX index, or Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d which measures the expectations investors have that markets will convulse sharply in the future. Since Mr. Trump became president, the index has been trading at very low levels, unperturbed by political histrionics.Of course, it is also true that a market that goes up for a sustained period, without the wild swings that have characterized past run-ups, will not set off volatility alarm bells.And in that regard, Mr. Trump\u2019s political supporters on Wall Street say they are not surprised by the market\u2019s willingness to charge ahead.What is driving enthusiasm, some investors say, is not so much that Mr. Trump is pressing down on the gas pedal with promises to increase spending and cut taxes, but rather his desire to take his foot off the brake and remove investor and business restrictions. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said his top priorities include rolling back regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama to keep large banks and funds in check.That Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president, has emerged as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and most influential advisers in this regard, is also seen as a sign that deregulation will remain at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda.And risk takers have not just taken heart in the administration\u2019s pledge to dismantle the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Some smaller loosening of financial regulations has also provided encouragement.This week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main derivatives regulator, said it would not penalize institutions for violating new derivatives standards.And a Dodd-Frank rule that required energy companies to disclose whether they made payments to foreign governments was recently voided by Congress.These are by no means giant moves, but they send a powerful signal all the same to investors frustrated by Obama-era restraints.One money manager and active fund-raiser for Mr. Trump during the election said that while many have seen disorder and disarray in the White House, he has seen a man of action doing whatever is needed to get the economy to grow faster.But here is another thought.Perhaps investors, after 10 years of living in constant fear over a succession of financial and political cataclysms, have finally decided to tune out the headlines and focus instead on an economy that, while not great, is not doing so bad, either.Ed Yardeni, a stock market strategist, calculates that savings deposits and money market funds, the two safest and lowest return options for the risk-wary, doubled to nearly $9 trillion at the end of last month from $4.5 trillion in early 2009.A lot of this caution was driven by the trauma of the financial crisis, of course, but it has been sustained in the years since by persistent worries (political and otherwise) that the markets will collapse again or the economy will tank. These anxieties have been reflected in persistent swings in the VIX index in recent years.Now, a lot of this pent-up cash earning close to zero in terms of interest rates is looking for higher returns in the stock market \u2014 with pension funds in particular leading the way.\u201cThe reality is that the real G.D.P. of the economy has never been higher and that consumer spending per household is at an all-time high,\u201d said Mr. Yardeni, who has been arguing for some time that markets have been obsessing needlessly over worrying headlines.\u201cThroughout all these corrections, people have been talking about an endgame,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe people have figured out that you can watch the news all you want and get upset, but that has nothing to do with earnings and the valuation of earnings in the stock market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Case Study in Chaos: How Management Experts Grade a Trump White House", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor someone who promoted his management skills and campaigned as an \u201corganizational genius,\u201d as Anderson Cooper of CNN put it, it has been a rocky White House debut for Donald J. Trump, the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the Oval Office.\u201cChaos\u201d seems to be the word most often invoked, closely followed by \u201cturmoil.\u201d (One exception: the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, who said he preferred \u201caction-packed.\u201d)In less than two weeks, Mr. Trump created upheaval at the nation\u2019s borders, alienated longtime allies, roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced.All new presidents undergo a learning curve. But Mr. Trump promised a seamless transition and, with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician, an administration that would function as a well-oiled machine.So it doesn\u2019t seem premature to ask some leading management experts for an assessment of Mr. Trump\u2019s first weeks, purely from the viewpoint of organizational behavior and management effectiveness, as I did this week.The unanimous verdict: Thus far, the Trump administration is a textbook case of how not to run a complex organization like the executive branch.\u201cOf course, this isn\u2019t new,\u201d he told me. \u201cHis campaign also violated every prudent management principle. Everyone including our friends on Wall Street somehow believed that once he was president he\u2019d change. I don\u2019t understand that logic.\u201d\u201cIf you thought immigration was bad, just wait for health care,\u201d Mr. Pfeffer warned.The White House did not respond to requests for comment.This is often easier said than done. It \u201crequires an openness to being challenged, and some self-awareness and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do,\u201d Mr. Polzer continued. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean decisions are made by consensus. The person at the top makes the decisions, but based on the facts and expertise necessary to make a good decision.\u201dNot to consult thoroughly with top cabinet officers before deciding on the order \u201cis insane,\u201d since they \u201chave the expertise and should be on top of the data,\u201d Ms. Greer said. \u201cIgnoring them leads to bad decisions and is also incredibly demoralizing.\u201dAnd there\u2019s another reason to consult, Mr. Polzer said: \u201cWhen people are genuinely involved in a decision and their input is heard and valued and respected, they are more likely to support and buy into the decision and be motivated to execute to the best of their abilities, even if the decision doesn\u2019t go their way.\u201dConversely, people who aren\u2019t consulted feel they have no stake in a successful outcome.\u201cDebate and dissent are essential to reaching any thoughtful outcome,\u201d Ms. Greer said. Comments like Mr. Spicer\u2019s \u201cwill discourage anyone from speaking up. You end up with group think, an echo chamber where people only say what they think the president wants to hear.\u201dAnd while it\u2019s understandable that the president was eager to act swiftly to follow through on his campaign promises \u2014 he had made a long list of actions to be carried out on \u201cDay 1\u201d \u2014 his directives came across as needlessly hasty and poorly thought through. Some had to be reframed (talk of a Mexican border surcharge) or significantly modified and clarified after the fact (immigration policy).I asked the management experts to ignore their views about the merits of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, but all said that execution and substance are inextricably linked.\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the receiving end of a policy decision, the merits of the decision and the execution go hand in hand,\u201d Mr. Polzer said. \u201cIf either one is done poorly, the outcomes will be bad. Even good plans that are poorly rolled out aren\u2019t going to work well.\u201dThat prompted even Mr. Ryan to say, \u201cNo one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this.\u201dSome Trump defenders have said that the president thrives on chaos, and it has proved to be an effective management approach for him in the past. But every expert I consulted said there is no empirical data or research that supports the notion that chaos is a productive management tool.\u201cI\u2019m not aware of anyone who advocates that,\u201d Mr. Polzer said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on in the White House, so I don\u2019t feel comfortable commenting on that specifically. But I can say in general that in organizational settings, less chaos is a good thing.\u201dEveryone agreed that there was still time for Mr. Trump to right the ship. Other administrations have had course corrections and personnel shake-ups. But having to reorganize only weeks into a first term is not promising.If this were the private sector, \u201csomeone would be fired,\u201d Ms. Greer said.That seems highly unlikely, since Mr. Trump has not even acknowledged a problem, instead blaming the media for an impression of upheaval in the White House.That is a fundamental problem, Mr. Pfeffer said. \u201cNo good business makes decisions that are based on falsehoods,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sense is that Trump takes no one\u2019s counsel but his own. That\u2019s bad management, period.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Profits? Nice, but for These Investors, Conscience Matters More", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSeth Holehouse, who owns an auction house in New York City, has focused his investments on renewable energy and recycled products. He has done so for the last five years \u2014 despite steadily losing money on the strategy.It is passion, not profit, that guides him. And he is not about to let up. Instead, he is prepared to keep losing money in the near term with the expectation of gains down the road.\u201cWe\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d he said. \u201cThis philosophy is how we\u2019d like to invest in 20 years.\u201dInvesting with a guiding passion isn\u2019t the same as being an impact investor, who aims to effect social change while earning a solid return. Passion investing is purer \u2014 if not puritanical. And seeing how people who embrace it deploy their strategies shows just how hard it is to follow a passion in investing without some level of compromise.Its better-known cousin, impact investing, tends to attract people who are pragmatic. They are looking for the best possible investment in a sector, based on established criteria.In terms of its volume of greenhouse emissions, for example, a consumer packaging company will most likely score much higher among environmentalists than every company in the oil and gas sector. But a certain type of impact investor might look for the oil and gas company that has improved its business practices the most or is as environmentally responsible and progressive as such a company can be.Instead of swearing off whole sectors, this type of impact investor is looking to make a practical accommodation between today\u2019s reality and tomorrow\u2019s aspiration.Passion investors spurn such accommodations. They are driven by a belief in the primacy of a cause \u2014 animal rights, climate change, reducing waste \u2014 and try to apply that desire to all investment types. It\u2019s not easy.\u201cI have a conversation about this quite often,\u201d said Mark Doman, chief executive of the Doman Group, an investment adviser. \u201cClients talk about how their ethics and morality guide their portfolio. I tell them it\u2019s a very slippery slope to find companies that meet their ethical bar while keeping in mind their goal is to grow their assets.\u201dMr. Doman added, \u201cIf you can find me a morally and ethically pure blue-chip company, that\u2019s more the exception than the rule.\u201dRoyce Pinkwater, a real estate broker in Manhattan, is trying to find such companies that align with her passion \u2014 reducing pollution \u2014 but are also profitable. She has taken to analyzing individual securities through the lens of pollution. This has led to tough choices.She had been earning solid returns investing in Amazon when she began to be concerned about the company\u2019s relationship with its vendors and how those vendors sold and packaged products. Was Amazon monitoring how they did business? How concerned were Amazon and its vendors with reducing the waste caused by their packaging?When people make private investments guided by passion, the risk can seem higher. Losing all of your money in any private investment is always a possibility, particularly in early-stage ventures.But when people assess a private investment primarily on their perception of its underlying merit, it also narrows their options. Their passion, in effect, has limited what may already be a small field of suitable investments.\u201cI have to be willing for the money to go down the drain completely,\u201d he said.It has happened once, with an investment in a food technology company. \u201cIt was a good idea, basically trying to create a more automated supply chain for small farms and organic farms,\u201d Mr. Baltzell said. \u201cThat did not work out.\u201dHowever difficult investing with a pure vision may be, it also comes at the risk of hypocrisy. Mr. Doman has clients passionate about avoiding investments in fossil fuels who have duly refused to put money into oil and gas companies. But one of those clients was comfortable owning stocks in airlines, which, of course, need fossil fuels to fly.\u201cWe talked it through and they said: \u2018Aviation and air travel are an essential part of the economy, and it\u2019s something I use \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity. I guess I can\u2019t go that far,\u2019\u201d Mr. Doman said of the client. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to own BP, Royal Dutch Shell or Mobil, but they\u2019d own American Airlines or Delta. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s a very subjective assessment.\u201dSome investors have put parameters in place to stay focused on their passions but not to go broke.A strategy that loses money for years, like Mr. Holehouse\u2019s focus on renewables, is not one any professional investor could sustain and still be in business. But he said he and his wife did not need their investments to live. And being tied to the jewelry business, he said, has allowed them to invest in gems and rare metals that regular investors cannot access.\u201cKashmir sapphires have gone up 500 percent in the last decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, it gives us more room to let our conscience drive things.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Baltzell\u2019s approach in choosing his angel investments is, by his own admission, one of convenience: He looks at deals that come to him and meet his criteria of reducing waste.

{"Headline": "Oil Producers Comply With OPEC Deal to Cut Output, but for How Long?", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat perception, though, has changed. And oil prices are up 20 percent since the agreement was reached.New data published on Monday by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shows that the cartel\u2019s 13 members have largely complied with the production cut.\u201cSo far this is holding up way better than any previous agreement had,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the research firm IHS Markit.Still, questions remain about how such a disparate group of countries will be able to hold together, and how much clout OPEC has in a market that has changed radically in recent years.Here is a quick rundown of the deal, its implementation, and its implications:In short: financial pain.That played havoc with the government budgets of major oil producers, pushing even Saudi Arabia \u2014 OPEC\u2019s biggest member by oil output \u2014 to borrow large sums in financial markets and to risk antagonizing its citizens by raising energy prices and cutting government salaries.Had the producers not agreed, prices could have fallen further. \u201cPeople got pretty close to the abyss and looked down, and it was pretty deep,\u201d Daniel Yergin, an oil historian, said in an interview. \u201cAs a consequence they stepped back and did something.\u201dRussia\u2019s shift to looking for production curbs was crucial, OPEC officials say. It gave the Saudis, who had insisted they would not cut output on their own, the comfort to agree to limits.The early results indicate, for the most part, yes.The estimates released by OPEC on Monday showed that its members made more than 90 percent of the agreed cuts in January, the first month that the deal was in force. OPEC says the figures are based on secondary sources, rather than on data from the members themselves, and that the figures largely confirm data published on Friday by the International Energy Agency in Paris. That monitoring group said OPEC had reduced its production 3 percent, equivalent to 90 percent compliance.\u201cWe are pretty confident that the picture we have come up with in January is not going to change very much,\u201d said Neil Atkinson, head of oil markets at the agency.Big countries appear to be holding to the deal. Saudi Arabia cut its output by more than it had initially promised, to less than 10 million barrels per day. Kuwait, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates also made large reductions, although Iraq and the U.A.E. both fell short of their pledges.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Russia, which is not a member of OPEC but which did sign the deal to cut production, also lowered its output in line with promises, according to the International Energy Agency. How much was cut by other producers outside the cartel is not yet clear.In a narrow sense, it is. Prices rose after the deal was announced, and they have largely held steady, around $55 a barrel.But oil producers also had another goal: to drain the huge stocks of crude oil and refined products, like gasoline, that have built up in recent years and are blamed for keeping prices low.It is unclear, however, if that strategy will work.The I.E.A. estimates that if OPEC maintains its current level of compliance with the Vienna deal, demand would outpace supply, helping to reduce those stocks. But, the agency says, it could take more than a year to bring inventories down to longer-term averages.And while OPEC and Russia are cutting back, other producers are trying to take advantage of the higher prices.That depends. Most analysts think they will stay relatively close to the agreed targets for the next few months. And there is also a good chance that the agreement will be renewed when it expires at the end of June, especially if it is seen as working but in need of more time.\u201cSaudi Arabia and other producer countries are feeling the pain of low oil prices and thus will likely stay the course if cuts prop up prices,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cBut the deal may unravel if those cuts are just offset by strong non-OPEC production growth in places like the U.S., Canada and Brazil that keeps prices low.\u201dIn the longer term, keeping output low may not be in the interests of major producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia. Those countries have large reserves and can extract oil at low costs.In the past, they have calculated that oil in the ground would be worth at least as much in the future. But that trade-off has shifted as new technology has made more oil available and as renewable energy and electric cars have appeared to reduce long-term demand.It may make more sense for the major producers to pump as fast as they can, to try to gain market share rather than risk leaving oil in the ground.A lot.Gasoline prices in the United States have risen about 7 percent since the deal was made, to an average of $2.29 per gallon for regular gasoline, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.Crude oil accounts for a little over half the price of gasoline, with the rest coming from costs like refining, distributing and marketing the product, as well as taxes.Therefore, gasoline prices are likely to follow those of crude. And oil prices also influence the costs of other energy sources like natural gas.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Manage a 529 Plan for Your Child\u2019s Education", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserSaving money in a 529 plan offers families a way to put cash away for college and save on taxes as well. But if your child is entering high school soon, it\u2019s time to double-check the allocation of your investments.Funds in state-sponsored 529 accounts, typically invested in mutual funds, grow tax-free. When you take the money out, funds aren\u2019t taxed as long as the money is spent on eligible education costs, including tuition, room and board and books. Total investment in 529 plans reached $253 billion in 2015, according to the College Savings Plans Network.Investments in 529 plans generally have a shorter window of time to grow than money in a retirement account does. And once a child enters high school, college is just four years away. A steep drop in the market could leave you short of funds when your child heads to campus \u2014 so scaling back high-risk investments is often a good idea, unless you have other funds available to pay for college.To help avoid that situation, most 529 plans offer age- and risk-based investment options, designed to automatically shift funds to more conservative investments as the child grows. Plans typically begin with a majority of funds in stocks, then shrink the allocation over time and add more bonds.Still, some advisers suggest that families \u2014 even those using age-based portfolios \u2014 double-check the specifics of their 529 holdings as college nears. The mix of investments and the shift in allocation, sometimes called a glide path, vary greatly by plan.\u201cI\u2019d want to look under the hood and make sure it makes sense for my particular circumstances,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman.P. J. Wallin, a financial planner at Atlas Financial in Richmond, Va., said that while age-based portfolios shift more money into bonds over time, fixed income doesn\u2019t always equal \u201csafe.\u201dFor instance, Mr. Wallin said, the 2021 age-based portfolio in Virginia\u2019s 529 inVest plan now has 70 percent in fixed-income investments. But with about 36 percent in \u201cstable market\u201d bonds, the mix also includes 5 percent in high-yield bonds and 10 percent in emerging market bonds, he said, which may be riskier than some investors want with college four years away.Mr. Wallin generally advises clients to move half of their holdings into a money-market fund within the 529 plan when the child enters high school, and even as early as the eighth grade. \u201cI like to put it in cash,\u201d he said.The point of a 529 plan, he noted, is that growth is tax-free \u2014 but it\u2019s risky to seek a lot more growth during the high school years. \u201cThe last thing we want is to stretch for an extra $5,000 of appreciation,\u201d he said, but lose 20 percent in a market downturn.Christopher Parr, a financial planner in Columbia, Md., recalled that his daughter\u2019s 529 fund lost a year of savings when the market dropped in 2008. \u201cYou better understand what\u2019s under there,\u201d he said.Steve Stanganelli, a financial planner in Amesbury, Mass., suggests that families consider moving funds for at least the coming year\u2019s college costs into cash. Connecticut\u2019s 529 plan, he said, generally offers a high-yield money-market option. And Ms. Lankford notes that some 529 plans even offer savings accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as an option.By moving to safety, families may miss out on market gains. Barry Korb, a financial adviser in Potomac, Md., said a couple came to see him a year ago, having saved the equivalent of four years of tuition at a private college in a 529 plan. The child was starting school in six months \u2014 and 90 percent of the money was in equities.On Mr. Korb\u2019s advice, they agreed to shift most of the funds to short-term fixed investments. Even though in retrospect the couple would have been fine if they had left the money in stock over the past year, Mr. Korb is firm that money needed within five years shouldn\u2019t be in the market. \u201cI do not regret my advice,\u201d he said.Here are some questions and answers about 529 savings plans:Can I deduct contributions to a 529 plan?Contributions are not deductible on your federal tax return. But many states offer a deduction on your state tax return.How many times can I change my 529 investment allocations?You can change them twice a year.What if my child doesn\u2019t go to college?The College Savings Plans Network says that you can change the plan\u2019s beneficiary to another family member, and they can use the funds for college. If you withdraw the money for noneducational purposes, the earnings \u2014 but not your contributions \u2014 will be subject to income tax, plus a 10 percent federal penalty. Some plans may charge extra fees or penalties.Advertisement"}

The company has created triggers for all sorts of market-moving signals \u2014 like changes in Federal Reserve policy and big stock price moves \u2014 but the triggers that Ms. Mayer\u2019s company has built around Trump\u2019s Twitter account have been by far the most popular, gaining 10,000 subscribers.Ms. Mayer, who used to be a currency trader at JPMorgan Chase, said there were a number of indications that many of her subscribers saw the tweet about Nordstrom and decided to buy the stock as a form of protest, just as many consumers said they would support the store after the president\u2019s attack.Ms. Mayer said that over time the market responses to Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamations seemed to be more restrained, which may reflect a recognition that the president\u2019s bark is worse than his bite.\u201cThe market doesn\u2019t seem to think that he\u2019s going to do anything else except complain,\u201d she said.Trump2Cash, Mr. Braun\u2019s bot, is set to hold the stock only until the end of the same trading day as the tweet. If the sentiment is negative, it places a short sale, or a bet that the price will fall, to take advantage of the stock going down.Mr. Braun has continually tweaked the rules governing Trump2Cash. He has, for instance, programmed the bot to ignore mentions of media companies, including The New York Times Company, because they amounted to more market noise than signal.But Mr. Braun says he will not mind if the bot ends up losing money \u2014 he is thinking about Trump2Cash as more of an art project than an investing strategy, and he plans to donate any money he makes from the few thousand dollars he has invested to Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, as a rebuke to Mr. Trump\u2019s politics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, Mr. President, Banks Are Lending", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThis is the party line: Banks aren\u2019t lending nowadays because the regulatory burden they face is too onerous. And that is hurting the economy and job creation.Articulating this view, President Trump has vowed to slash financial regulations to fix the problem.\u201cFrankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can\u2019t borrow money,\u201d he said in early February. \u201cThey just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank,\u201d the Wall Street reform law of 2010.Anecdotes can be compelling, of course. So many people with nice businesses who can\u2019t borrow money. That sounds very bad.But the actual figures tell a different story.Indeed, a look at recent bank results shows that lending among the big institutions is rising, not falling. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the most recent period, Bank of America, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and Wells Fargo all reported increases in their average loan figures.So banks are not lending less.Still, they could be doing more lending, says the veteran bank analyst Richard Bove, of Rafferty Capital Markets. And higher volumes of lending \u2014 of course, assuming the loans are appropriate \u2014 would help create jobs and fuel economic growth.There is no doubt that Congress\u2019 regulatory response to the financial crisis of 2008, which was largely fueled by reckless mortgage lending, tightened the rules for banks. Chief among them was a requirement that these institutions set aside greater amounts of capital to cover potential losses. That was justified, but it is crimping lending.And there are other reasons these institutions are relatively restrained in their lending, Mr. Bove said.\u201cYou cannot make the case that bank loans have not grown as a result of Dodd-Frank,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only case you can make is that Dodd-Frank has been a depressant on bank loans because of the increase in capital ratios and the need to put more money into liquidity.\u201dOther drags on loan growth, Mr. Bove said, include rising interest rates, which reduce the value of the securities these banks hold. Increasing interest rates contributed to diminished common equity positions at a group of banks Mr. Bove follows.Bank managers cannot control interest rates. But they can control the amount of dividends they pay out to shareholders, and the amount of stock they buy back in the open market. And generous distributions to shareholders by bank officials are a big factor in diminishing the money left over for making loans.Stock buybacks and lush dividends come out of a bank\u2019s retained earnings, also its source for increased lending. And Mr. Bove characterizes these payouts as financial engineering, pursued by bank executives interested in making their stocks perform better. He criticizes this practice, because while dividends and buybacks are good in the short-term, fewer loans will translate into reduced long-term earnings power at a bank.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that stock buybacks and high dividend payments eat into banks\u2019 common equity and slow down their ability to make loans,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis also slows down the secular growth rate of the company.\u201dThe amounts being paid out are considerable. During 2016, Wells Fargo returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases net of stock issued to employees. And in the most recent quarter, J. P. Morgan returned $3.8 billion to shareholders. That included $2.1 billion of net stock buybacks.Representatives for the banks declined to comment for this column. But officials at these institutions often contend that buying back stock and paying rich dividends are ways of returning excess capital to their shareholders, who are entitled to that money.At a presentation in 2014, for example, Marianne Lake, J. P. Morgan\u2019s chief financial officer, described the bank\u2019s capital allocation decisions: \u201cThe first priority is to support appropriate business growth and to provide a healthy dividend payout with the potential to increase over time,\u201d she said.Shareholders love their dividends and stock buybacks, of course, so none are likely to complain about these practices. Both help to keep share prices aloft as well.But buying back shares and paying rich dividends to shareholders diminishes a bank\u2019s common equity. And among 18 large banks that Mr. Bove follows, 14 showed declines in common equity in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of increased interest rates, buybacks and dividends. The combined decline in equity totaled almost $18 billion; in his view, that means the banks have lowered their ability to lend by $250 billion.To be sure, none of these banks are paying out all of their excess capital in dividends or stock buybacks. And that leaves them with a much fatter cushion for bad times.But Mr. Bove said that he had recently spoken with some bank executives who are considering paying out all the growth they report in retained earnings or common equity. \u201cThis would effectively negate any contribution that profits would make to retained earnings,\u201d Mr. Bove wrote in a recent research note. \u201cThe combination of further interest rate increases and large buyback programs would accelerate the decline in common equity and the ability of banks to make loans.\u201dIt is nothing new for the private sector to complain that regulations are cutting into their businesses. Given that the Dodd-Frank law runs to over 1,500 pages, undoubtedly some of its rules could be eliminated without bringing back reckless lending. This is especially true for smaller institutions. One of Dodd-Frank\u2019s bigger errors was to require smaller banks that had played no role in the crisis to ramp up their compliance duties as well. This was unfair and, yes, burdensome.Mr. Bove said he believes that some of the regulations should be reversed, but the elements he cited are not those that Republicans are focusing on.\u201cThe Republicans in the House and Senate cannot even agree with each other as to what should be deregulated,\u201d he pointed out in a recent research note. \u201cIn the Senate, they want a big-government approach to change the structure of the industry. In the House, there is a desire to get rid of irritating amendments to Dodd-Frank. Nothing is going to get done.\u201dIf Mr. Bove is right, that might be a good outcome. But this much is clear: The next time someone tells you that a wide swath of financial regulations needs to be reversed because they are crimping bank lending, you can tell them they\u2019ve got only part of the story.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
