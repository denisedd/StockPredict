{"Headline": "The Jobs Americans Do", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "The Future of WorkPopular ideas about the working class are woefully out of date. Here are nine people who tell a truer story of what the American work force does today \u2014 and will do tomorrow.Supported byThe decline of the old working class has meant both an economic triumph for the nation and a personal tribulation for many of the workers. Technological progress has made American farms and factories more productive than ever, creating great wealth and cutting the cost of food and most other products. But the work no longer requires large numbers of workers. In 1900, factories and farms employed 60 percent of the work force. By 1950, a half-century later, those two sectors employed 36 percent. In 2014, they employed less than 10 percent.For more than a century, since the trend was first documented, people have been prophesying a dire future in which the working class would no longer work. In 1964, a group of prominent liberals wrote President Johnson to warn of a \u201ccybernation revolution\u201d inexorably creating \u201ca permanent impoverished and jobless class established in the midst of potential abundance.\u201dMachines have taken the jobs of millions of Americans, and there is every indication that the trend will continue. In October, Budweiser successfully tested a self-driving truck by delivering beer more than 120 miles to a warehouse in Colorado. In December, Amazon opened a small convenience store near its Seattle headquarters that has no cashiers. Customers \u2014 for now, Amazon employees only \u2014 are billed automatically as they leave the store. In January, Bank of America opened branches in Denver and Minneapolis that are staffed by a lone employee, A.T.M.s and video terminals. And Americans are making a growing share of purchases online: about 8.4 percent of retail sales in 2016. These changes are driven by consumer preferences, not just by corporate cost-cutting imperatives. People like shopping in bed in the middle of the night. People like that computers make fewer mistakes. And people grow accustomed to computers. A few years ago, I watched a woman walk up to a bank teller and ask where she could find an A.T.M. The teller asked if she could help. No, the woman said, she just needed to withdraw some money.But the forecasters were wrong in the most important respect. Workers continue to find work, but now the jobs are in service. Taking care of aging baby boomers, in particular, has become by far the largest driver of job growth in the American economy. Among the occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects to grow most rapidly over the next decade: physical-therapy assistants, home health aides, occupational-therapy assistants, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, occupational-therapy aides, physician assistants. ... You get the idea. Nine of the 12 fastest-growing fields are different ways of saying \u201cnurse.\u201dIn 1950, service work made up about 40 percent of working-class labor in the United States. By 2005, that share had climbed to 56 percent, according to data from a 2013 analysis by the economists David Autor at M.I.T. and David Dorn at the University of Zurich. The available evidence, Autor said, suggests that this trend has continued \u201cvery rapidly\u201d over the last decade, increasing the share of American workers who work in the service industries.The rise of service-sector employment reflects the fact that Americans on average have more money to spend and that we are spending relatively less of that money on physical goods, because those goods have become cheaper. It took 10.5 hours of work at average wages to buy a bicycle in 1979; it took just four hours in 2015. Most Americans don\u2019t want a second and third bicycle, so that leaves more money for other purposes. And increasingly, the money is spent on services: help around the home, entertainment and vacations and, most of all, education and health care.These jobs are difficult to mechanize or to perform with greater efficiency. Convalescents cannot be trained to eat more quickly. A phlebotomist cannot draw blood from two arms at once. Robots, as yet, cannot change diapers. Moreover, consumers may have an emotional investment in seeing this caring work performed by people rather than machines. They may be willing to pay for a personal touch.Another limitation on our ability to program computers to do the work of people is summarized by the observation of the Hungarian scientist Michael Polanyi that \u201cwe can know more than we can tell.\u201d Consider the work of a security guard, who is basically tasked with sounding the alarm if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Technology improves security, but it is not easy to write a formula approximating intuition.The Cassandras, however, were right to warn about poverty in the midst of abundance. Personal-service providers \u2014 \u201cservants,\u201d as they once were called \u2014 tend to be poorly paid. There is little job security; the benefits are meager; the work is physically demanding and emotionally draining. It is not particularly surprising that women and immigrants have been more likely to take these jobs than native-born men. For many of the caretaking service jobs, less than 10 percent of the work force is male.The wages of service work increasingly determine the welfare of the American working class and, to a substantial degree, the broader economy. But politicians have paid little attention. That\u2019s partly because Americans continue to view service work as a way station, not a way of life. Teenagers get their first job at McDonald\u2019s; mothers dip back into the work force as receptionists; seniors make a little extra money as Walmart greeters. The reality is that these are the kinds of jobs millions of Americans hold for their entire working lives. And increasingly, these are the jobs their children will perform, too.\u2014Binyamin Appelbaum Santa Clara, Calif. \u2022 The Home Health AideBy Elise CraigNine years later, at age 69, Bersabe is among nearly a million Americans who work as home health aides, a field that is expected to grow 38 percent by 2024, faster than most other occupations, thanks in large part to the aging baby-boom population. Already a senior herself, Bersabe works 65 hours a week caring for two elderly clients with dementia. She spends five 12- and 14-hour night shifts in her clients\u2019 homes, providing companionship, reminders to take medicine and light housekeeping for one client, and everything from bathing and dressing to diaper changing for the other.Having two jobs is partly a necessity and partly a hedge; should one of her clients die, she can still rely on income from the other. She also needs the money. Because she is a member of the Service Employees International Union Local 2015, the agencies that Bersabe works for pay her $16.13 and $11 an hour. California\u2019s current minimum wage is $10.50, but the living wage for someone like Bersabe is $11.29.Bersabe is grateful for the money and has no complaints about her wages, but she acknowledges that making a living in the Bay Area\u2019s technology bubble is tough. She lost her house after the 2008 layoff, and she and her husband, who works nights as a security guard, now share a three-bedroom apartment rental behind Levi\u2019s Stadium, where the 49ers play, with two other elderly couples.The gratitude Bersabe\u2019s clients show her \u2014 one kisses her when she arrives \u2014 is incredibly fulfilling, she said, but the work is hard. Dementia patients can be very unpredictable. \u201cI have a very tame cat, and when they start to have sun-downing\u201d \u2014 the late-afternoon confusion that can be a symptom of dementia \u2014 \u201cI have a wild tiger,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the person herself, it\u2019s the sickness.\u201d Once, when a client began to get agitated and yell at Bersabe, she sneaked around to the front door and rang the doorbell. The client welcomed Bersabe as an old friend that she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.Bersabe expects to work through her 70s and 80s and maybe even into her 90s. \u201cI\u2019ll work as long as I can stand on my own two legs,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as I can drive and walk and God permits me, I\u2019ll enjoy the job I love.\u201d Bersabe has no intention of being a burden to her three children, who have families of their own and are scattered from Kentucky to the Philippines. \u201cHonestly, I am thinking, when the time comes, who is going to take care of me?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bother my kids. I want them to see me as a kicking woman, like I was before.\u201dElise Craig is a freelance writer and editor based in San Francisco.Brooklyn \u2022 The Hair BraiderBy Jazmine HughesUfot, 38, has known how to braid since she was 15; she picked up the skill in Warri, Nigeria, where she was born. A family friend owned a braiding shop, and she visited every day, watching the women do their work and, eventually, persuading them to let her practice on their customers\u2019 heads. She majored in economics at Delta State University in Nigeria, but while she was at school, she found out she had thyroid cancer and eventually moved to the United States for treatment. She started braiding hair for the money and never returned to economics. \u201cThere\u2019s more money doing hair,\u201d she told me. And because she\u2019s in such high demand, Ufot can work 12 to 15 hour days, sometimes seven days a week, depending on appointments. She charges between $100 to $250 for each style, depending on its intricacy. She hasn\u2019t gone on vacation in five years.Unlike most people trained in cosmetology, braiders, many of whom are immigrants, don\u2019t use chemicals, sharp objects or heat; just a comb, oil, water and their hands. Individual states legislate the requirements for becoming a licensed hair braider; in several, braiders \u2014 even those with a pre-existing knowledge of braiding \u2014 are required to complete more than 2,000 hours of training at cosmetology schools, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars and whose classes have almost nothing to do with styling black women\u2019s hair. Many cosmetology schools don\u2019t even offer braiding instruction.In 2016, Iowa ended its cosmetology-license requirement for hair braiders, allowing them instead to pass basic health-and-sanitation exams with the state; Nebraska, too, recently ended its laborious stipulation of 2,100 hours of cosmetology training for natural hair braiders. In New York, braiders are required to obtain a natural-hair license, which allows the stylists to perform the chemical-free techniques of styling black hair \u2014 for example, shampooing hair, applying extensions, making dreadlocks, braiding \u2014 and not much else. It costs about $70 and mandates schooling, which costs more. But many braiders operate without licenses.Ufot wants to go to cosmetology school; her goal is to enroll by year\u2019s end, if she can get enough financial aid. She figures it will cost her about $15,000, so she\u2019ll continue braiding and attend night classes as long she can get someone to look after her 6-year-old daughter. She told me that she wants to learn how to do all types of hair \u2014 dyeing, perms \u2014 and dreams of owning her own shop. \u201cI want to get my cosmetology license so I\u2019m able to do all of the things,\u201d she told me, laughing. \u201cI want to be able to cut white people\u2019s hair!\u201dJazmine Hughes is an associate editor for the magazine.Cicero, Ill. \u2022 The Fast-Food WorkerBy Ben AustenA few weeks after meeting the organizer, Alvarez said, she and her co-workers handed in a petition demanding that the store manager show them more respect in front of customers. Not only did the yelling stop, she said, but they soon received a raise of as much as 75 cents. \u201cPushing works,\u201d Alvarez says she learned. In March 2014, she joined her first rally, a multicity coordinated Fight for $15 day of action.Alvarez is now 24 and still works at the same McDonald\u2019s. Nationally, jobs in retail and food services outnumber those in manufacturing by more than two to one. The country\u2019s largest private employers include Walmart, McDonald\u2019s, Kroger and the conglomeration of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. These chains are no longer places just for teenagers to work part time: The average age of a fast-food employee has climbed to 29; like Alvarez, a third of them have spent some time in college.Fight for $15 doesn\u2019t operate like a traditional union: There are no contracts with employers, and Alvarez and others pay no dues. The Service Employees International Union has been its primary source of funding from its inception in New York City, in 2012. Yet Fight for $15 organizers take credit for winning wage increases for 22 million workers in America. Although the federal minimum wage of $7.25 hasn\u2019t budged since 2009, numerous cities and states since 2012 have raised their base pay to $12, $13 and even $15 an hour. Under President Trump, the effort is sure to face additional hurdles. But Fight for $15 helped lead the campaign to derail Trump\u2019s first pick for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, organizing workers from his fast-food chains to march on their stores and to share their stories of wage theft. Low pay is an issue that crosses party lines: Two of every five U.S. workers earn less than $15 an hour.Today Alvarez makes $11 an hour at McDonald\u2019s. She has never been put on the schedule for a full 40-hour week; she receives no benefits, health coverage or overtime. Yet the raise has allowed her to replace the moldering floorboards in her basement apartment. And Alvarez has been transformed in other ways by the labor fight. She has emerged as one of its spokeswomen, and the job has taken on a new significance. \u201cWhen people say we should go back to school, I say the adjunct professors who joined us went to school,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cHow come they\u2019re not doing better? I\u2019m not just serving customers. I\u2019m also serving these innocent ladies\u201d \u2014 her co-workers \u2014 \u201cwho might not be conscious of their rights. I\u2019m like their protector.\u201dBen Austen is working on a book about Chicago\u2019s Cabrini-Green public-housing complex.Brooklyn Park, Minn. \u2022 The Delivery DriverBy Jaime LoweIn recent years, online giants like Amazon have pushed for ever-faster delivery times, sometimes delivering orders on the same day. As consumers increase their online shopping \u2014 total retail sales in the United States increased only 2.9 percent last year, but online sales rose 15.1 percent \u2014 distribution networks have adapted by integrating more and more consumer destinations into their systems. Mark Merz, a spokesman for O\u2019Reilly, attributes part of the company\u2019s success to \u201chaving inventory immediately available when a customer needs those parts.\u201dThough O\u2019Reilly extended its reach to 4,829 stores in 47 states last year and revenue surpassed $8.5 billion, that growth hasn\u2019t led to an expansion of its work force or changed the nature of its jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been short-staffed for over six months,\u201d Culver says. \u201cGuys are doing extra work and taking on extra stores for their routes.\u201d Culver, who belongs to the Teamsters Local 120, says he is not paid by the amount of time it takes him to complete his deliveries but according to the route driven, which varies from year to year. Culver says he made roughly $53,000 last year, earning almost $23 an hour. \u201cOur wages haven\u2019t really gone up in the same way that other jobs\u2019 wages have gone up,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to go to special school to get my license, and how we\u2019re treated and looked at hasn\u2019t really changed in 20 years.\u201dCulver, who is 56, doesn\u2019t expect that technology will eliminate work like his. \u201cI don\u2019t see how automatic truck drivers are going to work,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many variables.\u201d O\u2019Reilly still needs people to operate the electric pallet jacks and hydraulic liftgates at the rear of their delivery trucks, still relies on backs and arms to unload and inspect orders. Despite the toll the work has taken on Culver \u2014 two operations to fuse vertebrae in his neck and a lower-back operation \u2014 he says he likes the job. \u201cI\u2019m happy doing this, I enjoy what I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope I can make it to 65.\u201dJaime Lowe is a freelance writer and a frequent contributor to the magazine.Las Vegas \u2022 The Customer-Service RepBy Eric SteuerNot long after landing in Las Vegas, Dolan started looking for a job. She found a call-center opening with Zappos, the online shoe-and-apparel retailer. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know anything about the company,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after I was hired, I started talking to locals, and people were like: \u2018You have no idea, do you? We all tried to get in there.\u2019\u2009\u201dZappos has more than 500 people on its customer-service team, about a third of the company\u2019s total staff. Most employees work together in the company\u2019s headquarters, a 10-story building downtown that used to be Las Vegas\u2019s city hall. Employees like Dolan, who work the phones, start at $14 an hour, about a dollar less than the median wage earned by the more than 2.5 million Americans who work as customer-service representatives. But Dolan, who makes slightly more than that, points out that, unlike at many other companies, most Zappos workers are full-time employees who receive benefits like health insurance and retirement plans.At Zappos, employees are encouraged to interact with co-workers throughout the business and eat together on campus. The company frequently hosts events, ranging from product demonstrations to scavenger hunts, which are open to all employees. Dolan said this is one thing that makes her current work so much better than previous jobs. \u201cI\u2019ve been in places where I wasn\u2019t even allowed to take a break with someone if they were a different pay grade than I was,\u201d she said.Another difference from Dolan\u2019s previous call-center jobs is that Zappos reps aren\u2019t limited in the amount of time they are allowed to spend on each conversation. \u201cAt other jobs, I\u2019d be stressed because I\u2019d have to resolve each call in about five minutes in order to make my numbers,\u201d Dolan said. She knows she could be making more money somewhere else, but she wouldn\u2019t enjoy her day as much. \u201cI figured I\u2019d do this for six months just to get something local on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 so I could look for something else,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t looked for a job since I stepped foot in here. I don\u2019t plan on it.\u201dEric Steuer is a contributing writer for Wired based in San Francisco.Columbus, Ohio \u2022 The Meat CutterBy Abe StreepCentral Ohio is particularly welcoming to refugees, having resettled more than 17,000 since 1983. In November 2016, the region became a flash point for those opposed to resettlement when a Somali-born Ohio State University student was killed by police after attacking pedestrians. Still, in early February, the Columbus mayor, Andrew Ginther, signed an executive order supporting the resettlement of refugees. His reasons were economic as well as altruistic. Nearly 12 percent of Columbus is foreign-born. According to a recent study from the New American Economy, a nonprofit research-and-advocacy group, Columbus-area immigrants pay $1.2 billion a year in taxes and have an annual spending power of $3.2 billion. They work as doctors and engineers, open small businesses employing thousands, perform manual labor in warehouses and frequently do the jobs that many other Americans will not, like meatpacking.SugarCreek is one of many meatpacking businesses nationwide that have turned to refugees. Last spring, the company approached Community Refugee and Immigration Services (CRIS), a Columbus refugee- resettlement agency. \u201cThey needed people,\u201d said CRIS\u2019s Marcus Gorman, who arranges employment for the newly resettled. \u201cThey had a lot of opportunities for entry-level workers, and they were accustomed to working with folks that spoke little to no English.\u201d Now, Gorman said, about 65 of CRIS\u2019s clients work at SugarCreek. Since Sebatutsi started last November, he has opted to work every day, which he said is the best part of the job. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of overtime, and you can make money.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthat\u2019s also the worst thing.\u201d He is no longer able to join his family at church. All that pushing, slicing and packaging is repetitive, but it\u2019s far better than life in Gihembe. \u201cThe kids can ask you for something, you cannot provide,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here you work, you take care of your problems, you do something for yourself.\u201dAbe Streep is a contributing editor for Outside and a contributing writer for The California Sunday Magazine.Dalton, Ga. \u2022 The Carpet WhispererBy Lizzie O\u2019LearyGuido, who is 23 and goes by Lupe, has been working at Engineered Floors for almost two years. She has risen quickly, starting on yarn machines, before driving a Hyster forklift, working as a production clerk and now serving as a tufting scheduler. She creates orders, dictating the type of yarn to use and how much footage of carpet each job will need. \u201cWithout this person,\u201d she said of her role, \u201cthere really is no show.\u201dIn the political sphere, manufacturing work is often associated with men, and specifically white men. But women have always worked in carpets in Dalton and at Engineered Floors. And Dalton is about 50 percent Latino, which is reflected in the work force here. Many people in the city came from Mexico in the 1970s and \u201980s to work in the industry, including Guido\u2019s parents, Jose and Martina.Lupe Guido was born in Dalton and dreamed initially of becoming a lawyer. \u201cI talk a lot,\u201d she said with a laugh. But at 18, she wanted independence and her own money and went to work at Mohawk Industries, one of the largest carpet companies in the city, where her mother still works. It was not what her parents had in mind. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was always: \u2018Go to school, go to school,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. \u201c\u2009\u2018You don\u2019t want to be working how I\u2019m working.\u2019\u2009\u201dBut the carpet industry, like most of American manufacturing, has undergone radical changes. The hardest and most dangerous jobs are now performed by machines that are mostly run by computers, and those computers are watched over by people like Guido.Engineered Floors is new in comparison to Mohawk or Shaw Industries, the two companies that have dominated Dalton for decades. But Guido has been able to move up quickly. She earns $15.50 an hour, up from $11 an hour when she started in 2015. At the end of each year, she gets a $500 bonus.Guido said she would like to stay at Engineered Floors if she can. To do so requires vigilantly managing her time so that she can move up. She\u2019s awake at 6 a.m., clocks into her job at 7 and works a 10-hour shift until 5 p.m. After dinner with her fianc\u00e9, who also works in the carpet industry, Guido spends her nights studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree in human-resource management at Georgia Northwestern Technical College. One day, she wants to be a department manager or a plant manager. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve been growing and growing,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want for that to stop.\u201dLas Vegas \u2022 The Hotel CleanerBy Amanda FortiniSometimes the job is that straightforward, but often she opens the door to find what all G.R.A.s dread: a \u201ctrashed\u201d room. \u201cThey eat and they leave all the trash everywhere: cans, food,\u201d she said, gesturing with her hands. She was seated at a folding table in a trailer parked in the lot of the Las Vegas Culinary Workers Union. \u201cEspecially the bachelor party. Oh, my God, those are bad.\u201dBecause she is a member of the union, the job pays her $17.65 an hour. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226, chartered in 1935, is the largest union in Nevada, representing 57,000 men and women from 167 countries (its membership is 56 percent Latino and 81 percent people of color), among them cooks, bartenders, cocktail servers, porters, bellmen and guest-room attendants. The average wage of a culinary-union worker is $23 an hour, compared with the $10 an hour made by a nonunionized Las Vegas hospitality worker or the $6 an hour Almada, who is 42 and who moved to the United States from the Mexico border town of Agua Prieta (she got her green card when she was 11, and became a citizen when she was 22), was paid at her last job in a coffee-cup-making factory in Tucson.She said she was fired from that job for taking two months\u2019 maternity leave, which prompted her and her (now former) husband to move to Las Vegas. They had heard that there were jobs at the casinos, where 90 percent of the hospitality work force on the Strip belong to the culinary union. But it was only after they divorced and she needed to support herself and her three children that Almada applied for her job at the Aria.That was six years ago. Almada enumerates all the ways that the job and its attendant union membership has improved her life: free health insurance and pharmacy benefits; a pension; job security; and soon a $20,000 down payment she will use to buy her first house. Initially she didn\u2019t understand the benefits and regulations the union conferred. This is a common reason workers can still be taken advantage of, particularly those who don\u2019t speak English. For the past seven months, though, Almada has been on an extended, contractually allowed, union-sanctioned leave of absence to serve as an organizer at Mandalay Bay Casino; she is teaching other workers to read and understand their own contracts. \u201cI never had these rights in Arizona,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I had my little one, they fired me and nobody helped me. If I was working here with the union, that doesn\u2019t happen to me.\u201dAmanda Fortini is a contributing editor at Elle magazine and a visiting lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.Boston \u2022 The Pipe FitterBy Carlo RotellaThe fifth child of an overwhelmed single mother, Awan was kicked out of four schools and took a bullet in the shoulder before going to prison at 18 for trying to shoot a rival gang member. While serving a three-year sentence, he resolved that he would change his fate.With the help of a former prosecutor who took an interest in his rehabilitation, Awan found his way into Operation Exit, a program founded in 2014 in which the city of Boston partners with unions to channel residents with criminal backgrounds into the trades. Having sampled carpentry, sheet-metal work and other options, Awan, who had always been fascinated by welding but doesn\u2019t like heights, chose pipe fitting over iron work.There\u2019s plenty of politics in the building trades, but there\u2019s also an ethos of craft meritocracy. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you look like, it\u2019s what your clevis hangers look like,\u201d Awan said, referring to the brackets used to support pipes. \u201cAll at the same level, nothing crooked. It\u2019s about your work ethic.\u201d He\u2019s already planning to get his 5-year-old son into the local when he\u2019s old enough.Awan, who is 28 and currently a second-year apprentice making $30 an hour plus benefits, can become a journeyman in three years, and he looks forward to continuing up the scale of seniority and pay toward the top rate of $50 or so an hour. He still lives near the Four Corners section of Dorchester where he grew up, but he\u2019s shopping for a house outside the city. \u201cYou come from no money for food, nothing, to where you\u2019re buying a house, buying a car,\u201d he said. \u201cYour son needs a school uniform, you can get him one.\u201dBoston\u2019s mayor, Martin Walsh, intends Operation Exit to enable this kind of transformation of prospects and consciousness. Walsh, who also grew up in Dorchester and had his own troubles (a bullet grazed his leg) before putting his life on course in the building trades, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had 80 graduates come through this program, and we\u2019re expanding from the building trades into coding and culinary arts. Some of these guys were impact players on the street. It has an effect.\u201dPrograms that reduce crime by connecting offenders and potential offenders to meaningful work are getting more attention across the country. Some, like Operation Exit, focus on re-entry after prison; others, like the Chicago CRED initiative recently started by the Emerson Collective and Arne Duncan, the former U.S. secretary of education, try to reduce gun violence by teaching job and life skills to young men adrift from both school and the labor market.

The company was founded 40 years ago by his father, Peter, and Peter\u2019s friend Dave Kalina, both tool and die makers, in Kalina\u2019s basement. Machining like theirs is labor-intensive. Even as the business expanded to more than 100 employees in two warehouses in Ramsey \u2014 a manufacturing town founded by French traders and settled in the 1850s on the banks of the Mississippi River \u2014 many of its customers switched to competitors overseas, induced by improvements in the technologies of developing nations coupled with falling trade barriers. But McGillivray and Kalina found a lucrative niche making molds for the most intricate medical products. Orthodontic braces, for example, use brackets that have unique shapes based on the angles of the teeth to which they will be affixed; the bracket molds, which are injected with powdered steel, must be cut to a degree of precision 40 times thinner than a hair. Thanks largely to the skill of Dynamic\u2019s machinists, the company did more than survive; it prospered. Then came the Great Recession. For the first time, McGillivray and Kalina, once able to offer bonuses, struggled to make payroll. To keep going, they needed to produce more molds or cut costs, or both.Last month, on a damp, gray day, Joe McGillivray took me on a tour of one of Dynamic\u2019s facilities, a former steel factory adjacent to a railroad track. The walls were painted cream with green trim, and the thick hum of motors made the cavernous space feel almost cozy. He led me to an injection press the size of a bakery oven. Inside, a nozzle moved up and down, shooting molten plastic into a mold, where it cooled around the end of a catheter tube. The resulting piece, when the tube was placed in a patient, would be used as a connector by a surgeon threading tools like scopes or stents into his or her body. A young man in a hairnet, gloves and goggles sat at a table facing the press. The robot was beside him.Before the robot arrived, McGillivray told me, four people worked the press. One inserted the catheter tubes into a frame that held them still; one set the frame on a mold, ran it through the press and took it out; one removed the finished tubes from the frame and trimmed away excess plastic; and one inspected the final products. The process was unforgiving: If an operator hit the stop button an instant too late, the plastic burned, ruining the part. Inevitably, even the nimblest foursomes produced lots of scrap.Now, as we watched, the operator inserted two tubes into a frame and put it on a rack. The robot, which had a sensor and a magnetic pad attached to its end, tapped the frame with its pad to pick it up, pivoted and gently placed the frame on a mold inside the press. Then it cocked its wrist and nudged a button with one of the pad\u2019s corners. A wheel inside the press spun like a lazy susan, 180 degrees, positioning the mold beneath the nozzle and bringing around a second mold with a frame of cooled catheters. Next the robot lifted this frame and moved it to a trimmer that ejected the catheters. Finally, it stacked the empty frame beside the operator. The cycle took 35 seconds. All the while, the operator examined finished catheters and inserted tubes into frames at a steady but unhurried pace.It wasn\u2019t the robot\u2019s speed that was revolutionary, McGillivray said; other automated machines could do the same things faster. The innovation was its \u201ccollaborative\u201d ability: This robot is safe to work with. If it bumps into someone, it stops. (McGillivray, a father of three young daughters whose standards of personal responsibility are marked even by Minnesotan standards, tested this feature on himself first: \u201cLet\u2019s just say it hit a fleshy part of my body, and I didn\u2019t like it. But it didn\u2019t leave a bruise.\u201d) This meant that he didn\u2019t have to build an expensive, semi-permanent safety cage around it. And because the robot is easy to move and reprogram, it can quickly be reassigned to whatever unique processes are required to fill the one-off orders Dynamic typically receives.The robot\u2019s price tag was $35,000, and within two months, it paid for itself by quadrupling the efficiency of the press and eliminating scrap. There was one caveat, though: \u201cProductivity did decrease when we first put the robots in,\u201d McGillivray said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re so dang fun to watch.\u201d He has since purchased two more of them from Universal Robots, a Danish company, and hired a technician to maintain them. No one was laid off, and the company\u2019s finances are sounder than they have been in nearly 20 years. \u201cI guess I\u2019m kind of an evangelist,\u201d he told me.The more I talked with engineers and civilians alike, the more I came to believe that this feeling was hardly unusual and that it went beyond the perfectly rational fear that a robot might take your job. \u201cMy deep worry is that every time you see a robot doing what a human does, there\u2019s this visceral response \u2014 it\u2019s human nature,\u201d Julie Shah, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at M.I.T. and the leader of its Interactive Robotics Group, told me. This response is so intense, and so crucial to people\u2019s acceptance or rejection of robots, that Masahiro Mori, a Japanese robotics professor, famously graphed it in 1970. He found that our affinity for robots increases as they come to look more and more human \u2014 until the point when the likeness is similar enough to momentarily fool the eye. Once the illusion is discovered, the viewer is unsettled and affinity plunges, a dip Mori dubbed \u201cthe uncanny valley.\u201d The danger is that our uneasiness will prevent us from preparing for a future in which robots interact with humans in increasingly sophisticated ways, and one that \u2014 thanks to rapid advances in computing and mechanical engineering \u2014 is coming, and coming soon.Much of the current political upheaval in the United States and other Western democracies can be traced to how threatened we feel when faced with this future. Central to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and presumably to his victories in manufacturing states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, was his promise to bring back the 10 percent of factory jobs that have disappeared in the wake of the Great Recession. But the fact is, American manufacturers are producing more products now than they were before the crash, with fewer workers, which suggests that those missing jobs have been automated. And while collaborative robots are showing up on factory floors first \u2014 where automation has always debuted, taking on repetitive, heavy and hazardous work \u2014 they are likely to find their way into other workplaces soon. (The \u201ccollaborative\u201d label, widely used to imply coexistence, is a bit misleading; robots that can learn, problem-solve and simulate human emotion are still confined mostly to laboratories.) Already, surgical robots make it possible via remote control to perform low-risk operations in outpatient settings; robot home-health aids may soon help people with limited mobility get out of bed, cook meals and perform other routine tasks; and driverless vehicles are poised to take over the transportation and trucking industries. It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to see how similar algorithms, or operating instructions, could enable robots to do many of the tasks required of waiters, maids and hospital workers. A few years ago, Amazon purchased Kiva Systems, which coordinates warehouse robots whose job is to move heavy boxes to stations where human stockers, whose fine motor skills have yet to be affordably mechanized, transfer the boxes to shelves.\u201cWe\u2019re moving into an era where people and infrastructure are in a more fluid relationship,\u201d says David Mindell, a professor of aerospace engineering and the history of technology at M.I.T. The question is who will reap the economic rewards of that change. \u201cWe tend to think that automation, generally speaking, replaces humans, but really in the big picture that isn\u2019t true,\u201d James Bessen, an economist at Boston University, told me. Instead, it makes goods cheaper, increasing demand and creating more jobs. Only when a product or service becomes so cheap and ubiquitous that lowering its price can\u2019t get people to buy any more of it does automation result in significant unemployment \u2014 unless the displaced workers are absorbed by a growing market for a different product or service, or the labor force shrinks.Collaborative robots, designed to fill flexible roles and be smaller and easier to integrate among employees and existing machines, may have a subtler effect, raising the need for more nuanced measures of their socioeconomic impact. In one recent study, Carl Frey and Michael Osborne of the University of Oxford broke down 702 occupations in the United States in detail and analyzed the probability that they would be computerized. Nearly half of those jobs were found to have a \u201chigh risk\u201d of being automated within the next few decades. Telemarketers, accountants, retail salespeople, technical writers and real estate agents would be first; chemical engineers, clergy, athletic trainers and dentists last. Conversely, a new McKinsey Global Institute report argues that we should stop considering \u201centire occupations\u201d and instead focus on \u201cindividual activities.\u201d A server must deliver and clear plates (tasks a robot might take over), but he or she also observes diners and anticipates their needs (tasks at which people are still far superior). From this perspective, fewer than 5 percent of careers can be completely automated using existing technology \u2014 but \u201cabout half of all the activities people are paid to do in the world\u2019s work force could potentially be.\u201dEver since the invention of the transistor in 1947 started the transformation of computing \u2014 just a couple of years after the United States destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs \u2014 philosophers have anticipated a day when intelligent machines would do all our work for us. Some pictured a dystopia like the one Jeremy Rifkin described in his 1995 book, \u201cThe End of Work\u201d: \u201cLike a deadly epidemic inexorably working its way through the marketplace, the strange, seemingly inexplicable new economic disease spreads, destroying lives and destabilizing whole communities in its wake.\u201dOthers envisioned a society in which profits were distributed evenly in the form of a basic income, leaving people to spend their time as they pleased. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in his final sermon, exhorted his congregation toward this idyll of equality and freedom. \u201cYes, we do live in a period where changes are taking place,\u201d he said, naming \u201cautomation and cybernation\u201d among them. \u201cAnd there is still the voice crying through the vista of time saying, \u2018Behold, I make all things new; former things are passed away.\u2019\u2009\u201dStill others believed both scenarios were equally plausible and the outcome would depend upon how judiciously we regulated new technologies, nuclear fission being a powerful example, so that they reduced, rather than increased, human suffering. Chief among them was Norbert Wiener, a mathematics professor at M.I.T., who coined the term \u201ccybernetics\u201d to describe the study of the relationship between living beings and robots. \u201cWe can be humble and live a good life with the aid of machines,\u201d he wrote, \u201cor we can be arrogant and die.\u201dThe physical world presents robots with challenges that most toddlers navigate with ease: selecting a Lego from a bin, falling over and standing back up. The foundation of computing, transistors, are made of hard, rigid silicon, a substance at odds with the soft, flexible contours of our bodies \u2014 and the world we\u2019ve designed to conform to them. \u201cI\u2019m just teaching robots how to pick up stuff, and I think it brings to light how much we take for granted about these things,\u201d says Siddhartha Srinivasa, a computer-science and engineering professor at the University of Washington, who designs robots to help people with spinal-cord injuries navigate everyday environments. \u201cWhen you make coffee or you pick up something, you\u2019re performing these beautiful intricate maneuvers.\u201dThe collaborative robots entering manufacturing today are not doing anything nearly as elaborate. In fact, much of the technology they use is decades old. What\u2019s new is the conviction that they are safe, a position largely cemented in 2011, when the International Organization for Standardization added new language to its industrial-safety guidelines to address their implementation. Soon afterward, General Motors and its partner Fanuc (Fuji Automated Numerical Control), a Japanese robotics company whose American headquarters is a few miles from Lake Orion, initiated their first collaborative-robot project.At 4.3 million square feet, Lake Orion is one of G.M.\u2019s smaller plants and the only one in the United States efficient enough to produce compact cars, for which profit margins are much thinner than those of larger vehicles. Overhead, candy-colored Chevy Sonics and electric Bolt EVs travel in cages hanging from tracks near the ceiling as if en route up a ski slope. Their serene pace belies both the bodily risks posed by large moving objects that are insensitive to obstacles and the disaster lurking within all such circuits: a short anywhere along the line that decommissions the whole. On an assembly line turning out a $50,000 vehicle every minute, for instance, six hours of \u201cunscheduled downtime\u201d for repairs represents a potential loss of $18 million. A major benefit of Fanuc\u2019s robots, 30,000 of which are already working in G.M. plants noncollaboratively, is that 8,000 of them are linked to the internet via cloud computing, so engineers can monitor their health and recommend preventive maintenance.The streamlined nature of operations at Lake Orion makes it an ideal testing ground for new production tools, including G.M.\u2019s first collaborative robot, a supersize version of Dynamic\u2019s but with an exterior like that of a foam pool noodle. The engineers at G.M. and Fanuc agonized over what color it should be. Orange screamed \u201cdanger\u201d; yellow suggested \u201ccaution.\u201d They settled on a neon-lime hue they dubbed \u201csafety green.\u201d It stood next to a conveyor belt, lifting 35-pound tires and stacking them on a cart. The employees who once performed this duty had relinquished it gladly; even with the assistance of a lift, twisting to move the tires from belt to cart was the stuff of ergonomic nightmares.On the day I visited, the area supervisor was Diana Reed. A Detroit-area native, she had worked at the plant for more than a decade. Every two hours, she leaned under the robot to check tire pressures. When I asked what it was like working with it, she gestured to an earlier section of the conveyor, where behind a fence, a hydraulic press was picking up wheels and slamming them into tires with a hiss. \u201cThat one I\u2019m scared to death of; it could crush me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis one is completely safe. It\u2019s kind of like a pet dog. I forget it\u2019s there.\u201dWhereas the exoticism of a collaborative robot in Dynamic\u2019s workplace caused employees to stop and stare, G.M.\u2019s robots fit right in to an already heavily automated environment. At a glance, it was actually Reed, a petite woman in a ponytail, who looked most out of place amid stacks of tires that were almost as tall as she was. I had been reading Karl Marx, who, in the wake of the Industrial Revolution, accused machines of \u201csupplying capital with weapons against the revolts of the working class.\u201d But observing Reed in action with her robot, I could also see how collaborative robots might have a democratizing effect, giving people of various ages, sexes, dexterities and sizes an equal shot at excelling at all sorts of physically demanding careers. True democratization would require access to collaborative robots across industries, and it occurred to me that perhaps the profoundest difference between the coming wave of robot-driven automation and industrial revolutions of the past is that both Joe McGillivray and G.M. can afford to participate.And to the extent that collaborative robots are blank slates \u2014 multifunctional and reprogrammable as opposed to major investments whose functions are determined at purchase \u2014 they offer employees an opportunity to experiment. Far more than past automations did, they give their operators, as much as their owners, the power to influence how they will be used to maximize the time the operators spend on the facets of their jobs that they find most fulfilling.Later that afternoon, up the road, Fanuc\u2019s executives delighted in Reed\u2019s pet metaphor. She was exactly the sort of tech-savvy employee they were hoping to recruit to build, maintain and program their growing fleet of robots. We meandered through their machine shop, where classes were underway. Over the past decade, Fanuc has trained 47,000 students to use its equipment; nonetheless, the consulting firm Deloitte recently projected that two million manufacturing-related jobs will lack qualified applicants by 2025.In the Fanuc showroom, \u201cdelta\u201d robots \u2014 upside-down pyramids of springy arms \u2014 sorted fake batteries, EpiPens and prescription pills by shape and color, pecking at them with the speed of sewing-machine needles. Nearby, the world\u2019s largest robot arm with joints was swinging a Corvette through the air. One potential customer had debated attaching a nozzle that would allow the robot to 3-D-print a concrete house.\u201cMy confidence in having the robots do whatever we want is through the roof,\u201d Richard Maxwell, the company\u2019s engineering director, said. The only limiting factor he could see was cost.Fanuc\u2019s chief executive, Mike Cicco, was eager to dispel the notion that manufacturing jobs are sweaty and boring. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool alternative for someone who doesn\u2019t want to be a lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s rewarding \u2014\u201dClaude Dinsmoor, Fanuc\u2019s general manager, finished the thought: \u201cIt\u2019s not your grandfather\u2019s manufacturing.\u201dMy father took considerable satisfaction in my assignment to, as he saw it, report his life story. For a couple of weeks, I called to regale him with visions of a future in which robots become so much like us that they teach us about ourselves. At the M.I.T. Media Lab, researchers have programmed a \u201cgrowth mind-set\u201d into robots that have enough personality to engage preschoolers in puzzle games. An initial study showed that playing with these robots, which respond to adversity with statements like \u201cI will do better next time,\u201d increased the likelihood of children\u2019s believing that they can improve with practice: The robot was a teacher but also an experimental control for testing theories of mind. Across the street, Julie Shah is designing robots that can shadow people in highly instinctual jobs, like head nurses, and detect patterns in how they make decisions. This would enable the nurses to use them to help train rookies.Why wouldn\u2019t such a robot just do the job itself? The number of data points required for one to \u201clearn\u201d to fold a towel autonomously, let alone run an E.R., is staggering. But it would be relatively easy for a person wearing virtual-reality goggles \u2014 anywhere in the world \u2014 to inhabit a robot and fold towels until enough points were collected, Louis Hyman, an economic historian at Cornell University, told me. Would-be immigrants could physically occupy jobs here from home.Ultimately, the only impediment to the total dissemination of robots may be our appetite for human interaction. \u201cWe want a salesperson we can relate to,\u201d James Bessen told me. \u201cWe like to have a financial adviser whom we personally trust.\u201d Similarly, David Mindell said, we feel more comfortable when people help us interface with automation at places like airports.\u201cI think people still have value,\u201d Hyman added. \u201cIf the answer to everything is that the only people who have value are the programmers, we might as well give up.\u201dIn January, at Dynamic\u2019s annual company meeting, Joe McGillivray gave a speech. He described his vision of a system that transforms raw materials into finished products by itself. \u201cOne-touch manufacturing,\u201d he called it. He believed it would create more jobs that would pay better and be more fulfilling. \u201cThere\u2019s a knowledge they have,\u201d he said of his machine operators, \u201cfrom doing this by hand for so many years, invisible algorithms they know, and none of those machines would work without that.\u201d Still, he acknowledged that even with training, not all of his employees would succeed at translating their experience into binary language. \u201cI hope that number is very small for us, but it\u2019s troubling,\u201d he said. \u201cMy big question is: Are we going to be happy? I get a lot of fulfillment from what I do. Will I have that if I work 20 hours a week?\u201dThere\u2019s a good chance that the greatest struggles over how to incorporate collaborative robots into the work force \u2014 and possibly the most ingenious solutions \u2014 will happen at small-to-medium-size businesses like Dynamic, where the relationships among owners, workers and robots are most intimate. In the Dynamic conference room, dubbed the Think Tank, an aquarium is populated with guppies, and the words \u201cCreating what you imagine\u201d are painted on the wall. It seemed a little corny, but as McGillivary described how the company had switched from a \u201csuggestion box\u201d to an \u201cIf you see something you can change to make your job better, just do it\u201d mandate, a policy that by his calculations had resulted in 1,800 improvements over four years, I was reminded that engineers can solve problems only if they know about them. An inventor who has never been a server or talked at length with one is blind to the invisible preparations and attentions that make a meal in a restaurant go smoothly, and thus apt to believe that a robot need only handle plates and credit cards to do a server\u2019s job.My father, who often puts in 70-hour weeks while contemplating retirement, felt an instant bond with McGillivray as I described him and the way he talked about his own small business. He understood the satisfaction, my father perceived, even pleasure that comes from tracing a path with your fingers so many times that your thoughts drift and for a moment you become inseparable from the thing you are making. On weekends, my father rises early and goes to work so that he can set up and run his machines alone, spinning copper wire into coils that will lie on an eyeball or fit in medical implants. When he returns home, his Levi\u2019s hold the same faint aroma of industrial glue I remember from childhood, when the front door opened in the evening and I threw my arms around his legs.But as my father and my grandfather and pretty much any engineer would tell you, sentimentality is the enemy of progress. My grandfather hated the machine grease that lodged under his fingernails \u2014 that he spent hours scrubbing away. He would have loved the new robots.\u201cThat future is coming,\u201d McGillivray told me, when I asked him how his speech was received. \u201cWe can be among the first to do it and get so far ahead that it will be hard for anyone to catch us. We can do it along with everyone else and remain competitive. Or we can not get on the train and get left behind. And I didn\u2019t see anyone disagreeing with that.\u201dKim Tingley is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "And the Oscar Winners Will Be ...", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CarpetbaggerSee this year\u2019s Oscar nominees and make your picks.This category was locked up from the word go. Viola Davis could have easily run for best actress for her performance in \u201cFences\u201d \u2014 and arguably should have, given that she won the Tony for a lead role for the same part when \u201cFences\u201d ran on Broadway. But Ms. Davis is said to have chosen to run for supporting actress, a less competitive category. Regardless, few doubt it is high time that she won an Oscar. This is her third nomination, and she has already landed more than two dozen awards this season. While her fellow competitors have all gamely shown up to support their films, Ms. Davis owns the category.While there are indications of a possible upset \u2014 Dev Patel won the Bafta for \u201cLion\u201d \u2014 odds favor Mahershala Ali from \u201cMoonlight.\u201d Though Mr. Ali spent far less time onscreen than some of his fellow nominees \u2014 like Jeff Bridges, who dominated much of \u201cHell or High Water\u201d \u2014 his performance as the tenderhearted drug dealer Juan was one of the season\u2019s most talked about. He also brought peerless grace and elegance to his awards-show appearances, which are crucial to any campaign. It is hard to imagine anyone topping Mr. Ali\u2019s heartfelt \u201cI am a Muslim\u201d acceptance speech from the SAG Awards, except, come Sunday, Mr. Ali himself.\u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d was released 21 years before Damien Chazelle was born, yet the homage he pays to it and other musicals of yore in his hit, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d greatly endeared him to the academy. Although early chatter suggested his fellow nominees Kenneth Lonergan and Barry Jenkins were strong bets, Mr. Chazelle has mopped up big prizes: a Golden Globe, a Bafta and, crucially, the Directors Guild of America Award. The guild\u2019s membership overlaps with the academy\u2019s, and the D.G.A. Awards are largely predictive of Oscars. It also helps that Mr. Chazelle is a known quantity to the academy: His \u201cWhiplash\u201d took home three Oscars in 2015.Until a few weeks ago, Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia,\u201d about a plucky rabbit police officer fighting prejudice and a fear-mongering lamb, seemed a shoo-in for this prize, having collected a Golden Globe and a Producers Guild Award. But then \u201cKubo and the Two Strings,\u201d about a Japanese boy on a hero\u2019s quest to defeat an evil spirit, won the Bafta for animated feature, an accolade that usually foretells an academy win. \u201cKubo\u201d is also up for best visual effects, making it a very strong contender. But \u201cZootopia\u201d will probably benefit from its timing: It is a love letter to diversity and the triumph of acceptance over xenophobia, a message the film\u2019s campaigners have been pushing all season long.And the Academy Award for best documentary feature goes to \u2026 a nearly eight-hour television mini-series. Though the director Ezra Edelman and his backers at ESPN vigorously insist their virtuoso project \u201cO.J.: Made in America\u201d is genuinely a theatrical film rather than one made for TV, the fact is, it is both. And that has done nothing to stop Mr. Edelman from winning almost every major documentary award this season, among them a Producers Guild prize. While some believe the television lineage of \u201cO.J.\u201d will undercut its chances with the academy \u2014 and note that the Bafta for best documentary went to Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201c13th\u201d (\u201cO.J.\u201d wasn\u2019t eligible) \u2014 odds are that Mr. Edelman will be collecting an Oscar.Early in the season, the momentum seemed to be behind \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d a German satire with a run time of nearly three hours that thrilled critics. But that is long to sit through for a foreign film, especially for voters watching screeners. After France\u2019s entry, \u201cElle,\u201d failed to be nominated, energy seemed to shift to Sweden\u2019s \u201cA Man Called Ove.\u201d But then came the White House travel ban, which drew attention to Iran\u2019s much lauded entry, \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d by Asghar Farhadi, who announced that he would boycott the ceremony in protest. Mr. Farhadi won an Oscar for his 2011 drama \u201cA Separation.\u201d This time, voting for him has become political, which will probably give him the edge.\u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d a poignant and at times wry tale of a Massachusetts man gripped by grief, made history this year by becoming the first film to land a best picture Oscar nomination for a streaming service (its distributor is Amazon). Yet the film\u2019s best picture chances are slim, thanks to the juggernaut that is \u201cLa La Land.\u201d But Kenneth Lonergan, the \u201cManchester\u201d director, is expected to win the Oscar for best original screenplay. Few match his skills at capturing and conveying onscreen the idiosyncrasies, awkwardness and absurdities of everyday conversation and life. Also bolstering Mr. Lonergan\u2019s chances: His script isn\u2019t up against \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which was deemed an adaptation and has passionate support.Whether Barry Jenkins\u2019s screenplay for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a cinematic tone poem about growing up poor, black and gay, should be considered adapted or original is in the eye of the beholder. The Writers Guild of America and Bafta organizers deemed it original, but the academy decided it was an adaptation of an unproduced stage piece by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who receives story credit. The academy\u2019s designation certainly helped the film\u2019s chances in the adapted category by not pitting it against \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d which took home the original screenplay Bafta. Still, \u201cMoonlight\u201d ended up besting \u201cManchester\u201d for original screenplay at the Writers Guild Awards. Confusing? Sure.

{"Headline": "Review: Amazon\u2019s \u2018Patriot\u2019 Takes the Spy Thriller to a New Place", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow about a show that combines some of the better aspects of \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d \u201cFargo\u201d and \u201cThe Americans\u201d \u2014 in a comedy? Would that pique your peak-TV interest?In its baroque plotting and exploration of the comic possibilities of violence, it is reminiscent of a slightly less stylized \u201cFargo.\u201d The connection to \u201cThe Americans\u201d is more tenuous, but \u201cPatriot\u201d manages, despite its essential absurdity, to give the appearance of telling a credible story of international espionage.Instead of going in the direction of dystopian thriller (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d), morality play (\u201cFargo\u201d) or family drama (\u201cThe Americans\u201d), however, \u201cPatriot\u201d goes for a peculiar brand of earnest farce. John Tavner, played by Michael Dorman, a New Zealand-born actor new to American TV, begins the series in a funk because he has mistakenly killed a male hotel maid instead of the rogue physicist who was his target. Baked and moping in Amsterdam, he writes a plaintive song about his blunder: \u201cWondering why there are male hotel maids in other countries/You never see that/Never see that.\u201dBefore John can go all the way down the rabbit hole of guilt and shame, he is rescued by his father \u2014 who happens to be America\u2019s \u201cdirector of intelligence\u201d and is played by the wonderful Terry O\u2019Quinn \u2014 and sent on a new mission, which, like his earlier one, is aimed at stopping Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. It involves adopting a cover as an employee of a Midwestern pipe company, something John is perilously unequipped for, as a way to deliver large sums of money to allies in Luxembourg.The pilot, which was posted more than a year ago, gets the show\u2019s combination of black humor and wistful family dynamics just right. Exercises in sustained tone are tricky, though, and subsequent episodes (five were available for review) are less even. A reliance on long close-ups of pensive faces, and Mr. Conrad\u2019s fetish for scenes of group urination, start to pall. When the framework sags, you fall back on the casting: Mr. O\u2019Quinn, and Kurtwood Smith as John\u2019s skeptical boss at the pipe company, effortlessly embody the delicate balancing act Mr. Conrad is attempting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM Gives Watson a New Challenge: Your Tax Return", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its first steps toward commercialization, IBM\u2019s Watson took on grand, science-laden challenges like helping doctors diagnose cancer. But that is changing as IBM strives to build its artificial intelligence technology into a multibillion-dollar business.Today, companies including Geico, Staples and Macy\u2019s are adding the Watson technology to answer customer questions or to improve mobile apps that guide shoppers through stores.Now in its broadest deployment so far, Watson will be assisting H&R Block\u2019s 70,000 tax professionals this filing season at 10,000 branch offices across the country, where 11 million people file taxes.The H&R Block partnership with Watson, announced on Wednesday, is being presented to a wider audience with a 60-second television ad during the Super Bowl on Sunday.For IBM, the collaboration with H&R Block underlines its strategy in the emerging market for artificial intelligence technology. Watson will touch consumers, but through IBM\u2019s corporate clients.\u201cWatson will become a really smart, virtual assistant,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president of IBM\u2019s Watson business.The embedded-in-business formula is different from the path other technology companies are taking with digital assistants powered by artificial intelligence. Others are pursuing the broad consumer market directly with artificial intelligence software helpers like Siri from Apple, Cortana from Microsoft, Alexa from Amazon and Assistant from Google.In the corporate technology market, the major companies are racing to get on the artificial intelligence bandwagon, though they lack the early lead and powerful branding of Watson.Data-fueled artificial intelligence will be an ingredient in all kinds of software used in corporations, to streamline work, identify new customers, spot savings and guide product development, analysts say. By 2018, the research company IDC predicts that 75 percent of new business software will include artificial intelligence features.\u201cA.I. is becoming part of the mix, part of the infrastructure in consumer and business applications,\u201d said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.IBM is also banking on Watson as an engine of its corporate transformation. The company needs its new businesses like Watson, data analysis and cloud computing to more than make up for the erosion in its traditional hardware and software products.That has not happened yet. Two weeks ago, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarter of declining revenue.But there were encouraging signs in the last quarter of 2016.IBM executives noted that the company\u2019s newer businesses, including Watson, grew by 14 percent to represent 41 percent of total revenue. That was ahead of IBM\u2019s previous forecast that the 40 percent of revenue threshold would not be reached until 2018.But when Bill Cobb, chief executive of H&R Block, contacted IBM last summer, saying he wanted to use Watson to help \u201creinvent the retail experience for taxpayers,\u201d he heard what he called a candid assessment, not a sales pitch.\u201cThis is not magic,\u201d Mr. Cobb said the Watson team told him. \u201cYou have to teach Watson over time.\u201dWatson proved to be a quick learner. Its core skill is its ability to digest and classify vast amounts of text, using what is known as natural language processing. So, among other things, it was fed the 74,000 pages of the federal tax code and thousands of tax-related questions culled from H&R Block\u2019s data, accumulated over six decades of preparing tax returns.Then, H&R Block tax professionals were brought in to \u201ctrain\u201d Watson. They approved when Watson suggested a smart question for a particular tax filer and corrected it when a proposed question was off base. The tax professionals were not told they were working with Watson, just a software program.The technology was tested in about 100 H&R Block offices in January, and it will be available throughout the company\u2019s retail network next week. One goal, Mr. Cobb said, is to assist H&R Block\u2019s tax professionals and improve their chances of fairly increasing refunds and reducing tax liabilities for clients. Seventy-five percent of Americans who file taxes get money back. For H&R Block clients, the figure is about 85 percent, Mr. Cobb said.But Watson\u2019s other task was to make visiting H&R Block a more \u201cengaging and interactive\u201d experience, he said. Clients will be able to watch suggestions and questions on a separate screen, as the Watson-assisted tax professional works.Mr. Cobb said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with Watson\u2019s performance in the 100-office trial. But the test will come after this tax season, when H&R Block sees what percentage of customers return next year.The retention rate is crucial in the tax-preparation business. Sixty percent of the 140 million Americans who file taxes seek help instead of doing them themselves. Kartik Mehta, an analyst at Northcoast Research, estimates that H&R Block\u2019s retention rate is 75 percent. \u201cIf they can get that 75 percent up to 80 percent, it\u2019s a big deal for H&R Block,\u201d Mr. Mehta said.The Watson collaboration is a \u201clong-term partnership,\u201d Mr. Cobb said. Mr. Kenny of IBM described this tax season as \u201cphase one\u201d of the partnership.Over time, Watson\u2019s suggestions get better and better, more individually tailored to specific occupations, household finances and personal circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s crawl, walk, run learning,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cBut the pace of the Watson learning is so much faster than humans.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019: Why Network TV Is Feeling Hopeful", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia, stars of the NBC drama \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d were on the set one day last month, sitting in their fictional family\u2019s living room, as they discussed a fairly remarkable feat: how network TV can still create hits.Mr. Ventimiglia jumped in to add: \u201cYou\u2019re, like, HBO. What are you doing on NBC?\u201dBut can this show keep it up? Indeed, can any new show keep it up these days?A big-hearted \u2014 and occasionally quite funny \u2014 drama, \u201cThis Is Us\u2019\u2019 centers on the Pearson family as it navigates any number of challenges, like death, dieting and sibling rivalries. The show jumps from decade to decade stretching from the early 1980s \u2014 when Jack (Mr. Ventimiglia) and Rebecca Pearson (Ms. Moore) are raising three babies \u2014 to a present that features three still-figuring-it-all-out 36-year-olds.There are challenges ahead. American audiences have radically changed the way they watch TV, and laws that used to govern the industry have been rewritten. There is one recent phenomenon that \u201cThis Is Us\u2019\u2019 hopes to avoid: Shows that start hot have fizzled after a break between seasons. The 2015 finale of AMC\u2019s \u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d had 10 million viewers, yet its second-season finale barely registered half that, according to Nielsen.Likewise, USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot\u201d shed nearly half its audience between its first and second seasons. Broadcast network shows like ABC\u2019s \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d and \u201cQuantico,\u201d Fox\u2019s \u201cLast Man on Earth\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cBlindspot\u201d similarly saw big drops after fine rookie seasons. Even \u201cEmpire,\u201d which still has strong ratings, has lost a quarter of its viewership this season.Television executives offer a few theories: Several of those shows suffered creatively after strong starts; some shows deployed one twist too many, potentially exhausting viewers. And at a moment when there is more TV than ever, it\u2019s harder to get an audience to return to a show it has already sampled. This is one reason many networks are beginning to turn to limited and anthology series.This is a trend that is not lost on the people behind \u201cThis Is Us.\u2019\u2019\u201cI\u2019m aware of it because it happens to me,\u201d said Dan Fogelman, the show\u2019s creator. \u201cThere\u2019s a point in a TV show where I check out a little bit despite my best efforts. You know that feeling: You\u2019ve got that big DVR list at home, and you\u2019re suddenly not going back to a program that used to be first up.\u201dBut Mr. Fogelman and executives behind his show are convinced that \u201cThis Is Us\u201d has passed a series of stress tests that indicate it can avoid a serious drop-off.\u201cIt\u2019s already bucking the trend,\u201d said Dana Walden, co-chief executive of the Fox Television Group, which controls the studio that produced the show. \u201cIt has weathered an incredibly difficult fall in the TV business with the election, presidential debates, a wildly entertaining World Series and a holiday break.\u201dNBC executives even argue that the holiday breaks have benefited the show as word-of-mouth spread and new viewers began jumping on board by binge viewing. Within NBC\u2019s offices in Universal City, Calif., they have been referring to its performance in early December as the \u201cThanksgiving bump\u201d: The two episodes that were broadcast after the holiday had a jump of more than a million viewers, according to Nielsen.NBC\u2019s decision last month to give \u201cThis Is Us\u201d a two-season renewal was not just bravado. It was also a strategic decision meant to entice would-be viewers and assure them that the show is not going anywhere.Jennifer Salke, NBC Entertainment\u2019s president, said that as TV ratings had eroded, networks had been too trigger-happy in recent years, canceling shows that failed to hit traditional ratings benchmarks \u2014 even if the show had a loyal fan base.\u201cWe\u2019re all over social media to figure out who\u2019s watching, and there\u2019s a lot of negative sentiment that I heard that goes, \u2018I really want to watch it, but they\u2019ll just cancel it and burn us like they always do,\u2019\u201d she said.The long-term investment for \u201cThis Is Us,\u2019\u2019 she said, was intended as an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d for viewers who were reluctant to jump aboard.It was that same month, Ms. Salke said, that she thought it might be a hit for another reason: When she looked at lineups at the annual upfront presentations, she noticed programming slates overflowing with procedurals and crime shows.As Mr. Fogelman put it: \u201cNot everybody is a cop or a lawyer or a schoolteacher turned drug dealer. It\u2019s just a story about people and more specifically this family, and I think people are seeing themselves a little bit in it.\u201dMr. Fogelman said he had the 1983 dramedy and tear-jerker \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d in mind when he was conceiving \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d And the show is certainly emotional. (Critics have taken to calling it manipulative.)\u201cThis Is Us\u201d has been especially popular among women, ranking as the third-highest-rated show for female viewers ages 18 to 34, behind only \u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201dWhen asked why the show is popular right now, executives offered two explanations. One was tonal: At a time when TV has gone gritty, sophisticated and dark, audiences may have room for something else.\u201cI\u2019m all for really dark art and dark TV and film, but there\u2019s a point where people are craving a different kind of emotion at 8 or 9 or 10 at night, and maybe we\u2019ve tapped into that,\u201d Mr. Fogelman said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to hold hands with a TV show, and something about the show has done that.\u201dThe other part? That probably has something to do with the volatile and overheated political climate right now.\u201cThe uncertainty is in the air, and nobody knows what to expect in the next couple months, coming weeks and year ahead,\u201d Ms. Moore said.She said that, as a result, people were looking for \u201ccathartic entertainment.\u201dMs. Moore and Mr. Ventimiglia \u2014 both dressed as the Pearsons, circa the mid-1990s \u2014 said they didn\u2019t foresee any loss of momentum for the show, despite industry trends. Is there anything that could happen plot-wise to set it off track?\u201cMurder,\u201d Mr. Ventimiglia said, laughing. \u201cI think there would have to be murder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mystery Woman: A Novel Explores the Story of Andrew Wyeth\u2019s \u2018Christina\u2019s World\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Christina Baker Kline sets herself a stark challenge in her new novel \u2014 giving flesh to the back story of the woman who crawls across a desolate field in Andrew Wyeth\u2019s iconic painting, \u201cChristina\u2019s World.\u201d Anyone who has seen this work, a landmark of midcentury realism, already knows that in the course of this novel Anna Christina Olson is unlikely to scale the peaks of high society or discover the source of the Amazon. In \u201cA Piece of the World,\u201d Kline must dig deeper to find meaning in her heroine\u2019s circumscribed existence, in a life played out against the backdrop of a stern, unyielding landscape.Kline\u2019s previous novel, \u201cOrphan Train,\u201d also emphasized lives forged in hardship. But that plot was kept spinning through the perils endured by thousands of orphans transported to uncertain fates in the rural Midwest of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \u201cA Piece of the World\u201d signals from the beginning that stasis will define Christina\u2019s outward existence. \u201cI think of my own life,\u201d she says. \u201cAll the years, all the waiting that led to nothing.\u201dFrom childhood, a progressive disease hobbles Christina\u2019s mobility, yet she stubbornly refuses medical help and even the use of braces or a wheelchair, choosing to lurch in pain across the fields of her family\u2019s struggling farm on the salt-misted coast of Maine. No one seems to feel much pity for her, nor does she pity herself. Her parents dash her hopes of finishing school, relying on her to cook, clean and mend for them and her brothers. Meticulously, Kline documents the sheer physical toil required to survive in a home without electricity or running water, knocking the sheen off the nostalgic myth of an idyllic rural past.Eventually the others die or drift away and only Christina and one brother are left to hold bitterness at bay. Christina longs for more: not just an education but the love of a summer swell whose life in Boston might as well take place on the moon, so foreign is it to her country ways. She treasures a volume of Emily Dickinson\u2019s poems, a gift from a teacher who tries to reassure her: \u201cYour mind \u2014 your curiosity \u2014 will be your comfort.\u201dThe arrival, in 1939, of the painter Andrew Wyeth, summering nearby, provides relief from isolation. He rambles through the dilapidated property, capturing in paint the cracks in a white teapot, \u201cthe bleached bones of a storm-rubbed house.\u201d The novel evokes the somber grace of those paintings in language as earnest and straightforward as Wyeth\u2019s brush strokes, laying out a story as uncomplicated as his composition. Both painter and writer have a fine-grained feel for the setting, and both would seem to reject the irony, humor and abstraction of modernity. Christina\u2019s yearning, her determination, her will to dream, occupy the emotional center in both the novel and the painting.Yet in expanding on Christina\u2019s story, Kline defies what some might see as the strength of Wyeth\u2019s work, its undercurrent of mystery. Wyeth observes Christina only from the back. In fact, he once said he might have preferred to depict the field alone, leaving just the sense that Christina had been there. Despite the naturalism of his style, Wyeth asks viewers to exercise their own imaginations.In contrast, Kline sometimes over-explains, spelling out thoughts and feelings already apparent from the action and dialogue. This approach serves readers who want to fill in the blanks, to experience the daily grind of a way of life that often has been burnished by the passage of time, to honor the rectitude of people who stoically shoulder their burdens and get on with their chores. \u201cA Piece of the World\u201d is a story for those who want the mysterious made real.Becky Aikman\u2019s latest book, \u201cOff the Cliff: How the Making of Thelma & Louise Drove Hollywood to the Edge,\u201d will be published in June.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Deforestation, Once Tamed, Comes Roaring Back", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "A decade after the \u201cSave the Rainforest\u201d movement captured the world\u2019s imagination, Cargill and other food giants are pushing deeper into the wilderness.Supported byCOLONIA BERLIN, Bolivia \u2014 A few months ago, a representative from Cargill traveled to this remote colony in Bolivia\u2019s eastern lowlands in the southernmost reaches of the vast Amazon River basin with an enticing offer.One of those farmers, Heinrich Janzen, was clearing woodland from a 37-acre plot he bought late last year, hustling to get soy in the ground in time for a May harvest. \u201cCargill wants to buy from us,\u201d said Mr. Janzen, 38, as bluish smoke drifted from heaps of smoldering vegetation.His soy is in demand. Cargill is one of several agricultural traders vying to buy from soy farmers in the region, he said.Cargill confirmed the accounts of colony residents, and said the company was still assessing whether it would source from the community. That decision would depend on a study of the area\u2019s productivity and land titles, said Hugo Krajnc, Cargill\u2019s corporate affairs leader for the Southern Cone, based in Argentina. \u201cBut if a farmer has burned down its forest we\u2019ll not source from that grower,\u201d he said.A decade after the \u201cSave the Rainforest\u201d movement forced changes that dramatically slowed deforestation across the Amazon basin, activity is roaring back in some of the biggest expanses of forests in the world. That resurgence, driven by the world\u2019s growing appetite for soy and other agricultural crops, is raising the specter of a backward slide in efforts to preserve biodiversity and fight climate change.Here across the border in Bolivia, where there are fewer restrictions on land clearance, deforestation appears to be accelerating as well.Now, a new study by an environmental advocacy group points to fresh indications of large-scale forest-clearing by Bolivian and Brazilian farmers who trade soybeans with Cargill.That organization, Washington-based Mighty Earth, used satellite imaging and supply-chain mapping information from the Stockholm Environment Institute, an environmental think tank, to identify deforestation in Brazil where two American-based food giants, Cargill and Bunge, are the only known agricultural traders. The supply-chain mapping by the environmental institute uses customs, shipment and storage data, as well as production data from Brazilian municipalities to trace agricultural exports back to producers.In Bolivia, where supply-chain mapping is not available, Mighty Earth sent employees to areas where Cargill operates. The organization used drones to record the clearing of forests and savannas in areas where Cargill operates silos.The study was funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation and a nongovernmental organization, Rainforest Foundation Norway.A reporter for The New York Times independently traveled to remote areas of Bolivia described in the environmentalists\u2019 report and interviewed farmers engaged in deforestation who said they sold soy to Cargill. The farmers described what they called Cargill\u2019s push to increase its purchases of locally produced soy and its attempts to enhance bonds with local producers.Both Cargill and Bunge said the report seemed to inflate its role in the region\u2019s deforestation. Cargill\u2019s share of soy in the Bolivia municipalities in which it operates came to about 8 percent, Cargill said. Meanwhile, in Brazil\u2019s Matopiba region, Bunge\u2019s share was about 20 percent, the company said.And soy is just one crop behind deforestation, said Stewart Lindsay, Bunge\u2019s vice president for global corporate affairs.\u201cOne company alone cannot solve this issue,\u201d Mr. Lindsay said. \u201cA positive step would be for more companies to adopt zero deforestation commitments, apply controls to block crops grown in illegally cleared areas from entering their supply chains, report publicly on progress and invest millions of dollars to support sustainable land use planning efforts, all of which Bunge has done.\u201d (Bunge, however, is not a signatory to the New York Declaration of Forests.)In an interview, Cargill chief executive David MacLennan said the company was studying the allegations of deforestation in Bolivia and Brazil linked to the company. \u201cIf there\u2019s something there, if it\u2019s substantiated, we\u2019ll do something about it,\u201d Mr. MacLennan said. \u201cIf that\u2019s accurate, it\u2019s not acceptable.\u201cWe\u2019re going to honor our obligations and our commitments,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve committed to ending deforestation and to do our part in ending deforestation. Our word is our bond.\u201dOnly about 15 percent of the world\u2019s forest cover remains intact, according to the World Resources Institute. The rest has been cleared, degraded or is in fragments, wiping out ecosystems and displacing indigenous communities, scientists say.Behind the rise in deforestation is a strategy by multinational food companies to source their agricultural commodities from ever more remote areas around the world. These areas tend to be where legal protections of forests are weakest.The uptick in forest loss since then, however, has raised concerns that the progress is far from secure.Brazil was aware of the challenge of keeping deforestation at bay, Everton Lucero, the secretary of climate change and forests of Brazil\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, said in an interview.\u201cWe are very uncomfortable with the bad news that we had a rise in deforestation, and we are taking every possible measure to reverse it next year,\u201d Mr. Lucero said. Budget shortfalls amid Brazil\u2019s recent economic and political turmoil, he said, had wreaked havoc with its policing of its rain forests.When traveling to remote regions, \u201cSometimes our command and control units were without fuel for helicopters,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we are on a recovery path.\u201dBolivia, on the other hand, presents a different situation. President Evo Morales, a socialist, has made securing \u201cfood sovereignty\u201d a major part of his agenda, driving Bolivia\u2019s agricultural expansion. There are relatively few forest protections, and the government\u2019s Forestry and Land Authority is tasked with the potentially conflicting roles of regulating land use, forestry and agriculture, and issuing concessions for logging and farming. The landlocked country has declared that it expects to clear almost 14 million more acres of forest by 2025, to convert into farmland.A major culprit is the cultivation of soy, which has jumped more than 500 percent in Bolivia since 1991, to 3.8 million hectares in 2013, according to the most recent agricultural censuses. Little of that soy is consumed domestically. The vast majority is processed and exported as animal feed in a commodities trade that serves a global appetite for hamburgers, chicken and pork.\u201cThe forest is seen as useless land that needs to be made useful,\u201d said Nataly Ascarrunz, executive director of the Bolivian Institute of Forestry Investigation, a Bolivian nongovernmental organization that monitors and researches the country\u2019s forests.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure for economic development,\u201d Ms. Ascarrunz said. \u201cWhen resources are flowing, production is happening and people have work. It\u2019s very hard to argue with that.\u201dVictor Yucra, the director general of Bolivia\u2019s forest and land management at the Forestry and Land Authority, stressed the need for the Bolivian government to balance the protection of its forests with the needs of its agricultural sector.\u201cOur concern is in ensuring that intensive agricultural production takes place within a framework that also provides for sustainable forestry and protection for standing forests,\u201d Mr. Yucra said.Mr. MacLennan, the chief executive of Cargill, described a business trip to Brazil last year, during which he saw the Amazon from a plane window. \u201cYou look down and you see this beautiful forest,\u201d he said. \u201cKilometers and kilometers of forest. But you also see these big chunks of dirt.\u201cThe brown really contrasts with the green,\u201d he continued, comparing the forest and deforested areas. \u201cWhen you see it, it\u2019s like, \u2018Holy cow. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\u2019 It just hit me when I saw it in broad daylight \u2014 the impact the deforestation has.\u201dMr. MacLennan initially garnered praise among environmentalists for pledging to extend the no-deforestation pledge it had made regarding palm oil to cover every commodity the company handles. Cargill\u2019s commitment was called one of the most sweeping environmental pledges ever made by a large agricultural company. It earned Mr. MacLennan a photo opportunity with Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general at the time.Even before the New York Declaration, Cargill had made significant efforts to buy palm oil sourced only from land not linked to fresh deforestation, according to a supply-chain expert with extensive experience working on Cargill\u2019s global sustainability efforts. The expert spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying that to do so openly would jeopardize professional relations with the company.Cargill continued to invest millions of dollars adding extra staff members and hiring third-party auditors to verify that the palm oil was coming from established fields, not farmland freshly carved from the forest, he said. But Cargill has been less aggressive with other commodities, he said.Part of the issue was Cargill\u2019s decentralized setup, the expert said. Another problem was the resistance from commodities traders, whose incentive is to seek supplies from as many sources as possible in order to drive down costs. Buying only sustainably grown commodities would mean a more limited supply.Now, environmental groups accuse Cargill of backtracking on its 2020 deadline. In recent statements, Cargill has adopted a 2030 deadline for elimination of deforestation from its supply chain \u2014 a separate deadline, mentioned elsewhere in the New York Declaration, that was meant to apply to ending all forms of deforestation, not just those related to agricultural commodities.\u201cThey\u2019re willfully misinterpreting the Declaration,\u201d said Glenn Hurowitz, chief executive of Mighty Earth. \u201cThey\u2019re breaking their own pledge.\u201dCargill is committed, Mr. MacLennan said, to eliminating by 2020 deforestation from its production of palm oil, a commodity widely used in food, detergents and cosmetics. But, he said, Cargill had always understood the declaration to give all signatories until 2030 to tackle deforestation.\u201cI don\u2019t think I or others appreciated the vast complexity of the task,\u201d Mr. MacLennan said. \u201cLet\u2019s say that we are trading or buying and selling soybean meal. Where did the soybeans come from? And did they come from deforested land? Maybe we weren\u2019t buying the soybeans directly. I don\u2019t know.\u201dHolly Gibbs, an expert in tropical deforestation and agriculture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, called the 2030 deadline interpretation devastating. \u201cIf we were to wait until 2030,\u201d Ms. Gibbs said, \u201cthere would be no forest left.\u201dIn Mr. Janzen\u2019s newly cleared field, a long strip of land flanked by vivid vegetation, blue-white smoke drifted from a smoldering landscape.The German-speaking Mennonites, who live amid horse-drawn buggies and farmhouses that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in rural Ohio or Pennsylvania, trace their origins to 16th-century Protestant reformists who migrated to Russia, the United States, Canada, Belize and Mexico in search of farming opportunities and religious freedom. Some moved to Bolivia in the last century, and about 57,000 Mennonites now live in 55 secluded settlements here, eschewing some aspects of 21st century technology, like modern cars, but enthusiastically embracing others, such as tractors and genetically modified seeds.Their trade with companies like Cargill has transformed their communities into a bloc of relatively prosperous landowners. But in recent years, they have also been targeted by land reforms enacted by Mr. Morales, who has pledged to reverse the centuries of subjugation of Bolivia\u2019s indigenous majority.The farmer, Mr. Janzen, with the help of two laborers, spent the day digging roots from the earth, between smoking woodpiles. There was a brown jumble of slender trees, saplings, shrubs, bushes, vines and roots. Occasional larger trees showed gashes where the bulldozer first made contact, pushing them to the ground.Farther downfield lay more long, neat cordons of debris, waiting to be burned. \u201cIf the rain holds off, I\u2019ll burn the rest tomorrow,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Andy Weir\u2019s Best Seller \u2018The Martian\u2019 Gets a Classroom-Friendly Makeover", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are more than 160 swear words in Andy Weir\u2019s sci-fi thriller, \u201cThe Martian,\u201d including two memorably deployed F-words in the novel\u2019s first three sentences.The profanity did not strike Mr. Weir as excessive when he wrote the book nearly a decade ago. After all, the story\u2019s narrator, an astronaut named Mark Watney, is stranded alone on Mars with a dwindling supply of food and a rescue mission that is four years away \u2014 circumstances that warrant constant cursing.But shortly after the book came out, Mr. Weir started hearing from a subset of readers who objected to the obscenities.\u201cI got a lot of emails from science teachers who said, \u2018Man I\u2019d love to use your book as a teaching aid, but there\u2019s so much profanity in it that we can\u2019t really do that,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Weir, 44, who is cheerful, hyper-analytical and casually profane, much like his protagonist. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get that by a school board.\u201dAfter getting dozens of inquiries from teachers, Mr. Weir, who describes himself as \u201ca lifelong space nerd,\u201d asked his publisher, Crown, if they could release a cleaned-up edition of the book.The novel was pretty easy to amend, by simply replacing the foul language with tamer words like \u201cscrewed,\u201d \u201cjerk\u201d and \u201ccrap\u201d (Mr. Weir said there were \u201coccasional squabbles\u201d when he tried to lobby the censors to keep some of the less offensive swear words in.) A kid-friendly version came out last year, and it is now being used to help teach science in classrooms around the country.At Synergy Quantum Academy, a public charter high school in South Los Angeles, students are conducting experiments based on the novel. In physics class, students will build miniature solar-powered cars, and during astronomy next month, they will try to grow potatoes as Watney did, using a chamber modeled on NASA\u2019s Lunar Plant Growth Chamber.Eighth graders at Oak Middle School in Los Alamitos, Calif., are following a yearlong curriculum based on \u201cThe Martian,\u201d with lesson plans that use dramatic moments in the narrative to illustrate concepts like Newton\u2019s laws of motion, chemical reactions and spacecraft engineering. In a science class at Northwestern High School in Mellette, S.D., sophomores are using the novel as a jumping-off point for some hands-on experiments, like splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting for them to see the connection between the novel and the science they\u2019re learning,\u201d said Denise Clemens, a science teacher at Northwestern. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re not going to blow anything up.\u201dHer students seem happy to have an alternative to dry science textbooks.\u201cIt\u2019s been a really good way to understand ionic compounds and bonds and all the things you can do with chemistry,\u201d Jarret Haven, 16, said of studying \u201cThe Martian.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really opened up my mind.\u201dFor Mr. Weir and his publisher, getting the book into schools opens up a lucrative new market that could turn \u201cThe Martian,\u201d which was already a blockbuster that sold several million copies, into a perennial best seller that guarantees a built-in audience every year.Mr. Weir did not set out to write a science textbook. A college dropout and former software engineer who is fascinated by space exploration, Mr. Weir started writing \u201cThe Martian\u201d in 2009, mainly to entertain himself. The story grew out of a thought experiment, when Mr. Weir began imagining what a scientifically feasible manned mission to Mars would look like.The story took shape as Mr. Weir tried to work out what it would take to get to Mars, and how to keep a stranded astronaut alive on the planet (the creative use of duct tape is key).\u201cOftentimes, when I was double-checking the math, I would discover problems that I hadn\u2019t thought of that Watney would run into,\u201d he said.He wrote computer software to work out what the constant thrust trajectories would be for the spaceship\u2019s ion engine, and studied NASA satellite images to map out Watney\u2019s treacherous 3,200-plus kilometer course across Mars in a rover. He also calculated how many calories Watney would need to stay alive, how much water he would need to grow potatoes, and how he could manufacture water out of oxygen and hydrazine, a compound used for rocket fuel.Mr. Weir had failed to sell an earlier attempt at a novel, so rather than trying to get \u201cThe Martian\u201d published, he serialized it for free on his website. Some of his fans urged him to list it on Amazon, and he began selling it for 99 cents. He quickly sold 35,000 copies, and started getting inquiries from publishers and agents. Crown bought the novel and published it in 2014.Crown has printed nearly 30,000 copies of the classroom edition, which comes with a teacher\u2019s guide that lists discussion questions and activities and includes an interview with Mr. Weir about the science behind the story. Next month, Mr. Weir will address science teachers at the National Science Teachers Association\u2019s conference in Los Angeles, and his publisher will give away around 500 copies of the classroom edition of the \u201cThe Martian.\u201dDavid Beck, a science teacher at Oak Middle School, was one of the teachers who lobbied Mr. Weir for a sanitized version of the story. After he first read \u201cThe Martian\u201d two years ago, Mr. Beck immediately wanted to create a curriculum based on the novel. \u201cI thought, I could teach all of my eighth-grade physical science out of this book,\u201d he said.He proposed using the novel in his class to the school\u2019s principal, who loved the idea but thought the foul language could be a problem. They approached the district school board to see if they could assign the novel to students, and were turned down. (They even considered buying copies of the novel and redacting the swear words by hand with markers, but decided against it.)Mr. Beck then emailed Mr. Weir and later, his publisher, and asked if they had considered releasing a PG edition for students. At that point, similar requests were piling up. Crown wanted to wait until after the movie adaptation came out, to avoid confusing retailers and readers.When Broadway Books, a Crown imprint, published the school edition in 2016, Mr. Beck created a yearlong curriculum for the school\u2019s 380 eighth graders, who each got a copy of the book. So far, the students have been enthusiastic, and many have finished the novel ahead of schedule.Some teachers are skeptical that students need to be shielded from the profanity in \u201cThe Martian.\u201d Marc Montalbano, an English teacher at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, said he was using the original version of \u201cThe Martian\u201d with his seniors, who are also drawing on the text for science research projects. Watney\u2019s swearing makes him seem more relatable as a character and helps offset the heavy science, Mr. Montalbano said in an email.Nora Groft, a high school English teacher at Northwestern, said she taught the classroom edition of \u201cThe Martian,\u201d but told her students that a version with more adult language was available, too, and that the curse words might be appropriate, given the context.\u201cImagine if you were stranded on Mars,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think you\u2019d say, \u2018Goshdarnit\u2019?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Look Now, but the Great Unbundling Has Spun Into Reverse", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe internet promised to be the great unbundler. The evisceration of distribution costs would free consumers from paying for cable television channels they never watched, allowing them to bypass cable monopolies and pay only for the shows they wanted. No longer would anyone have to buy a $99-a-month triple-play package when all they wanted was the History Channel.Over the last two decades, consumers have felt liberated as traditional bundles unraveled \u2014 from music to media to retail.For instance, Craigslist and myriad other digital start-ups siphoned lucrative job and real estate listings from traditional newspaper bundles. Meanwhile, media firms held onto the economically challenged business of delivering news and entertainment.Proponents of the breakdown of the bundle economy most often cite cable television. Superficially, the evidence is compelling: In the last six years, pay TV penetration has declined from about 90 percent to 80 percent of homes \u2014 with more than two million homes cutting the cord in the last couple of years alone.But paradoxically, the same forces that allowed classified ads and news to be so easily separated also drastically increased the economic rationale for bundling across the board.Consumers merely have swapped one bundle for another (or often, several). There are more than 65 million subscribers to cheaper \u201cover the top\u201d packages provided by Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Sling TV and others (even excluding Amazon Prime Video). One does not always think of all of these as \u201cbundles\u201d because these services do not consistently categorize their content using the commonplace TV channel taxonomy. However, their aggregation of shows looks more and more like a traditional cable bundle.We are in the age of the great rebundling, when firms use packages of services as a way to increase their scale advantage and thus deepen the moat around their businesses.In music, the story is even starker than in television. At one time, consumers used to buy a collection of songs \u2014 on vinyl, cassette and then compact disc. It was possible to buy a single song or two in these formats, but the internet facilitated more and more people downloading individual tracks.Yet, today, there is an inexorable consumer shift to all-you-can-eat bundles of music. Already more than 60 million people pay for Spotify, Apple Music and others. These music bundles will increasingly be combined with other services as well to build competitive advantage. This newspaper currently includes Spotify with certain new subscriptions. And it is easy to see how Google and Apple will increasingly integrate music packages into their broader suite of services (as Amazon already has).Bundling has always worked well for products for which consumers have widely varying tastes and willingness to pay. The magic of bundle economics allows consumers to get more for less, while also maximizing revenue for the provider. Imagine that there are two hungry diners at a burger joint where the restaurant\u2019s marginal cost of food is zero-ish. One customer is willing to fork over $5 for a burger and $1 for fries. The other will shell out $5 for fries but only $1 for a burger. By selling a la carte, the restaurant maximizes revenue by pricing each item at $5. Both consumers leave hungry, and the business takes in $10. However, both diners would snap up a $6 bundle, allowing them to sate their appetites while shelling out $12 in total. Everyone is better off (perhaps not healthwise).In the digital environment, two additional forces are driving this tidal wave of digital bundling.First, the near-zero marginal cost of distribution makes all-you-can-eat packages compelling. Even heavy users of streaming services can potentially be profitable customers if the underlying economics of rights payments are well managed.The Federal Communications Commission appears to be relaxing its position on the bundling of data and services. The agency had been investigating the practice of \u201czero-rating,\u201d whereby a wireless carrier like T-Mobile allows its subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data cap. Recently, the F.C.C. dropped this investigation \u2014 believing that this kind of bundling is now commonplace in a competitive market. Plainly this is the thin edge of the wedge for net neutrality. Connectivity and cloud computing services will most likely start to include \u201cunrated\u201d services to differentiate themselves further from other commodity providers. In the short term, this shift will most likely be a boon for consumers. Time will tell whether this stifles long-range innovation \u2014 especially in bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming.Second, firms need to mitigate the high cost of attracting and retaining online consumers. Netflix can amortize the expense of acquiring and servicing a subscriber over the hundreds of dollars of revenue they will generate if they hang around for a couple of years. Selling individual shows for a few bucks a pop would be vastly more expensive in marketing, billing and service costs.Tying several services together (even when they are not all directly complementary) increases customer loyalty. Amazon Prime has more than 66 million subscribers. Just a few years ago, it was mostly a free-shipping service. Now, it includes an extensive library of free e-books, videos and music. The large base of Prime subscribers makes life hard for would-be Amazon competitors \u2014 who have to contend not just with Amazon\u2019s scale in any particular vertical but also the combined value of the eclectic products and services that Amazon bundles together. This value may also increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning help personalize these applications. Walmart may be four times larger than Amazon in retail, but Amazon\u2019s bundle magnifies the impact of its size, reducing its scale disadvantage.For insurgents, this trend complicates the already formidable challenge of competing with the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple \u2014 all of which have been adept at weaving various interconnected services together to magnify their scale advantage.Technology investors are obsessed with network effects. These help make firms like Facebook and eBay so valuable \u2014 because additional users increase utility for everyone, making it hard for upstarts to compete. But investors often forget that network effects are just a subset of scale advantages. Superior scale is what protects most businesses from competition. It would be hard to start a business to take on Coca-Cola because of its size advantage \u2014 especially in local bottling, distribution and marketing.During the road show for the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape, its chief executive, Jim Barksdale, famously commented that there are \u201conly two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.\u201d For many firms, the bundle is not a decaying symbol of legacy distribution. Rather, it is the new network effect: a critical strategy to amplify scale in the hope of building or deepening a moat to protect against foes everywhere.Jeremy G.

{"Headline": "Friday Mailbag: News Cycles That Won\u2019t Stop Spinning", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Public EditorThe Times should be fair to pro-lifers. After calling the Women\u2019s March just that, quite consistently, despite it really being an anti-Trump March, The Times refuses to afford the same treatment to the March for Life. Why is the liberal one given its proper name, while the much older and more established conservative one is referred to by The Times\u2019s characterization?Heather Johnston Marvell, South Orange, N.J.On the home page, the link to the briefing of the story read: \u201cPence Addresses March for Abortion Foes.\u201dIt seems like it should just be: \u201cPence Addresses March for Life.\u201d That is what the march is called, no? When you replace with abortion foes, it gives a negative connotation, which may be the NYT opinion, but this is not an analysis or opinion story.Cliff, Sunnyvale, Calif.We went to Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, for his reply.On the topic of abortion, we have long steered away from both \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-life\u201d (except in quotes), since neither term is really neutral. That said, I\u2019m surprised by the complaint over references to the recent march. While it\u2019s normal to use a variety of descriptions for any event, a quick search shows that we frequently used the formal name \u201cMarch for Life\u201d in connection with the Jan. 27 event, including in our main stories leading up to and describing the march.I was really distressed to see that the NYT chose to use the headline \u201cTrump Bars Syrian Refugees Indefinitely to Keep Terrorists Out\u201d to describe his horrifying executive order to ban refugees in need on false claims that they could be terrorists. Most refugees are women and children and none of the terrorist acts on our soil have been committed by Syrian refugees (or people from the other 7 countries he banned). I have always counted on the NYT to present news critically \u2014 it is essential to our survival as humane country that the NYT take that role very seriously now. If nothing else, please do not have headlines that further the xenophobia, bigotry and hatred our president is encouraging.Liz Roemer, Somerville, Mass.We asked Peter Blair, a copy desk supervisor, for a reply.I would readily admit that this was a poor headline. The copy desk was working quickly to publish a breaking story, and I think we lost a nuance there by putting the president\u2019s intent in our own words. If we had said something like \u201cTrump Bars Syrian Refugees Indefinitely With Stated Intention of Keeping Terrorists Out\u201d or \u201cTrump Bars Syrian Refugees Indefinitely to, He Says, Keep Terrorists Out,\u201d I think those are accurate and fair headlines. Of course, they\u2019re also awkward and unwieldy. But in trying to condense that thought, what we ended up with was inartful at best. An editor monitoring one of our social accounts that night noticed fairly quickly that readers were criticizing the headline. After a brief discussion with the news editor in charge, we realized that the best course was just to abandon the terrorist thought completely in the headline, and so we replaced it with something more straightforward.\u201cIt started with the doom-hued inauguration homily to \u2018American carnage\u2019 in United States cities co-written by Mr. Bannon, followed a few days later by his \u2018shut up\u2019 message to the news media. The week culminated with a blizzard of executive orders, mostly hatched by Mr. Bannon\u2019s team and the White House policy adviser, Stephen Miller, aimed at disorienting the \u2018enemy,\u2019 fulfilling campaign promises and distracting attention from Mr. Trump\u2019s less than flawless debut.\u201dWhy the seemingly gratuitous choice of \u201chatch\u201d? That word is often associated with \u201cplot.\u201d How about something more objectively appropriate \u2014 such as, for example, \u201ccreated\u201d or \u201cinitiated\u201d or something similar? I submit that The Times needs to be very careful here. It cannot afford to suggest even the appearance of bias, lest it risk undermining its own goal of unbiased reporting.Robert Jacobson, Port Chester, N.Y.We went back to Corbett on this point.This reader\u2019s question about \u201chatch\u201d is a good example of how more subtle word choices can also raise concerns. In this case, I understand the argument, but I don\u2019t believe that the use of \u201chatch\u201d shows political bias. I think the main distinction between \u201chatch\u201d and blander alternatives like \u201ccreate\u201d or \u201cinitiate\u201d is the sense of secrecy \u2014 for example, the American Heritage Dictionary\u2019s definition is \u201cto devise or originate, especially in secret.\u201d That element of secrecy was certainly an important component here, and relevant in the context; I think that explains the word choice.But these concerns and others like them demonstrate how tricky it is to preserve a neutral tone in our writing, and how sensitive readers can be to any sense that language is loaded or slanted. It\u2019s a challenge we have to take very seriously as we cover these contentious political issues.The column argued that this model could be of value to The Times, but urged the paper to proceed carefully. \u201cI hope The Times will move cautiously, not merely assuming readers will view this as a useful new service but actually asking them whether they do,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Times has a lot to gain. And also to lose.\u201dThis week, our office received our first email as the new arrangement began to make itself seen on The Times\u2019s site.Jane Reed, St. LouisWe asked Sam Sifton, the food editor, for his response.Finally, some readers, understandably, are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of news the past few weeks.My head is spinning after the first week of the new administration and my concern is that Week 2 will be similar. The administration seems to use chaos and confusion to their advantage. Stir up the media and the blue states with crowd-size complaints and the wall, while executive orders ban refugees and appoint Steve Bannon to the N.S.C. What is going to happen when we are all up in arms about the Supreme Court nominee this week? How do you cover a situation like this? And how do we read it?Ellen Ivens, Purchase, N.Y.That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg, Bucking Tide, Takes Public Stand Against Isolationism", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Thursday stepped into the raging debate about globalization.He pledged that he would push Facebook, which has more than 1.8 billion users worldwide, in a direction that would help convince individuals and governments that \u201cprogress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.\u201dThe letter comes close to a political statement by a chief executive who, as the leader of a global company, is essentially arguing against a tide of isolationism that is rising across the world.In an interview this week at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Mr. Zuckerberg said that when he started Facebook, \u201cthe idea of connecting the world was not controversial.\u201d\u201cThe default assumption was that the world was just incrementally moving in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s actually a real question.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg released his missive amid a fierce debate over the merits of globalization. In the United States, President Trump has displayed a deep streak of nationalism. Last year, Britain voted to quit the European Union. Those moves and others have been taken as signs of how globalization has caused strains \u2014 making it more difficult for companies to navigate a new world order.Mr. Zuckerberg said his reasons for writing the updated letter began to take shape before last year\u2019s presidential election, spurred by broader trends. He said he recognized that more people were feeling left behind by globalization, and by societal and technological changes. As a result, he wanted to focus different parts of Facebook in a way that helped people better come together.\u201cWe have to build a global community that works for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t have much doubt that this is the right direction to go in the long term.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said he planned to reorient Facebook, which turned 13 this month, around these new realities. His letter is filled with abstract ideas, including the notion of \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d and how to create stronger online communities, with few detailed steps about how to realize those goals.One top priority is building inclusive online communities that are supportive, safe and informed environments, to help strengthen bonds in the offline world as well. Mr. Zuckerberg also stressed the idea of using Facebook to create this \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d \u2014 essentially a digital means of connecting people around shared interests \u2014 mirroring social groups in the physical world like churches, governments and unions. That may encourage connections among people that transcend national and international barriers, he said.While Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned several concrete steps that Facebook has taken toward some of these goals, he gave few other specifics. He did not address how his vision might conflict with those of political leaders around the world, nor did he mention how emphasizing global connections benefited Facebook\u2019s finances.Getting to this point did not come easily. Since going public, Facebook has been on a growth tear, becoming one of the world\u2019s biggest and most valuable public entities.Facebook users disagreed, arguing that the photograph was not titillating but rather illustrated the perils of modern warfare. The social network eventually allowed the image to be posted on its site, noting that it had inherent news value.Mr. Zuckerberg said the episode made him realize how ineffective Facebook\u2019s content policy was at a global scale, given that cultural norms vary greatly by country. He said Facebook needed to get to a place in which users could perhaps choose their own content policies based on local laws and preferences, a marked departure from the company\u2019s blanket global approach of the past decade or more.\u201cI don\u2019t think that we, sitting here in California, are best positioned to know what the norms in communities around the world should be,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cAt some point, you just need a more dynamic system where people can just express that themselves.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg spent much of his letter focused on the importance of personal relationships. He pointed to \u201cvery meaningful groups\u201d \u2014 Facebook groups that people frequently engage in and return to \u2014 that are often centered on topics like parenting, sports or other shared interests. When people find an interest they are passionate about and form such a group, they are some of the most tightly connected relationships on Facebook, he said.To foster more of these groups in a safe way, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook needed to change some of the ways that it operated. That includes improving community safety with product updates similar to Facebook\u2019s \u201csafety check,\u201d a tool that lets people mark themselves safe during catastrophes. Mr. Zuckerberg said that governments regularly called Facebook to confirm that Safety Check was activated during crises like the massacre at a nightclub in Florida last year.Mr. Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook\u2019s role in keeping communities well-informed, which will necessitate tackling misinformation and highly polarized news. He alluded to Facebook\u2019s shifting role as a distributor of news, saying the social network is \u201cnot just technology or media.\u201dFacebook\u2019s goal, Mr. Zuckerberg said, was not to usurp traditional institutions like governments, religious groups and other communities that share interests. (When asked if he wanted to run for president of the United States, he laughed and declined.) Instead, he said, creating tightly knit online groups would make these traditional institutions stronger.It also would not hurt that such groups and connections could well make Facebook more essential to people, which in turn may increase the company\u2019s profits.\u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built to deal with modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cI just think it would be good if more people thought about things like this.\u201dAn article on Friday about an update to Facebook\u2019s mission statement misstated, in some copies, the location of a nightclub massacre last year. It was in Florida, not Paris. (A nightclub massacre in Paris occurred in 2015.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Sell Handmade Soap? Join the Crowd", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurship\u201cYou can use anything in your spice cabinet for fragrance,\u201d said Ms. Bosworth, whose fee ($168 per student) included hands-on soap-making from scratch, in this instance whipping up two batches of shea-butter soaps scented with essential oil blends: one with lavender, the other lemongrass.Tools included an immersion stick blender, a scale, a plastic mixing spoon and a large stainless-steel pot. At the end of the class, everyone went home with some soap and a reminder to let it dry out for four weeks before working up a lather.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like making your own soap \u2014 I love the alchemy of it,\u201d Ms. Bosworth, 52, told her students.Those students were all hoping for another sort of alchemy: turning their growing skills into a successful business. But they\u2019ll be joining a crowd.Part of what\u2019s helping fuel that growth is soap\u2019s status as a recession-proof indulgence. Whatever the economy, \u201cpeople are willing to buy that nice-smelling bar for $6 or $8 at the farmers market,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Donnell said.Further, soap makers \u2014 95 percent of whom are women \u2014 view the blending of alkali and oils as something they can do at home to supplement the family income.\u201cSome are happy staying small, but some are very entrepreneurial and want to have a lot of stores,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Donnell said.Since soap doesn\u2019t require premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 as long as it\u2019s labeled, sold and represented solely as soap \u2014 the barriers to entry are low.As is the price of getting into business. \u201cYou can get started for under $50,\u201d said Ms. Bosworth (presuming that you don\u2019t pay for her class).Soap-making is a relatively simple process as long as you have patience and a precise scale. But as with baking, some have the knack, and some don\u2019t.Even for people who are highly skilled, turning a big profit is a challenge. One lavender-infused bar smells pretty much like another after all, and removes dirt with equal dispatch.\u201cSoap is such a commodity,\u201d said Ms. Bosworth, whose website describes her as an herbalist, aromatherapist and energy healer based near Boulder, Colo. \u201cYou can find handmade soap anywhere.\u201dBut 19 years ago, when she was starting her business in Massachusetts, there were only four other indie soap makers in the state, she said, and just a few thousand in the country.When the economy tanked in 2008, \u201cI had a lot of competition all of a sudden,\u201d Ms. Bosworth continued. \u201cIt forced all of us to differentiate ourselves.\u201dFor a time, \u201corganic\u201d and \u201cgoat milk\u201d were useful terms for soap makers who were understandably eager to set themselves apart from the rest of the competition. \u201cBut then someone else would have goats\u2019 milk, and you\u2019d have to come up with something else to make you even more special,\u201d said Ms. Bosworth, whose response, for a time, was to offer sea-inspired soap, like seaweed and sea salt.Now her company offers 10 varieties of soap, all of which she still makes personally. She charges $8 for a six-ounce bar, but declined to say how many she sells a year.An average order is six to eight bars, though some customers buy as many as 30 decidedly unpretentious bars a year. \u201cOur soaps are all naturally beige,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to beautify with dyes and make it look unnatural.\u201dOthers in the business begin tinkering with lye and oils to address a family member\u2019s skin condition or as a way to avoid the artificial ingredients in commercial products.When her husband tried it and his skin stopped cracking, that was sufficient impetus for Ms. Jonas to start selling, as her website puts it, \u201ca good, clean soap made by a good, clean family.\u201d Goat Milk Stuff now sells several hundred thousand bars of soap a year, said Ms. Jonas, who has turned the soap-making chores over to her 18-year-old son, Colter.For some companies, soap ultimately becomes a loss leader. \u201cI make money off my soaps, but it\u2019s labor-intensive,\u201d Ms. Bosworth said. \u201cSoap will bring the customers in, but it can be the gateway to selling the higher markup and less labor-intensive lotions and serums and lip balms.\u201dHorse \u2018O Peace, for example, offers lip balms and moisturizers, and recently introduced a line of pet care products. Goat Milk Stuff\u2019s product line includes laundry soap, liquid soap, lotions, cheese, yogurt, milk, gelato and fudge.Fortunately for soap makers, consumers seem to appreciate their back-to-basics ethos. \u201cI think that when people start using it, they realize this soap is different from commercial soap,\u201d said Ms. Ryhanen of Saipua.More than that, they buy into the art of the well-made bar. \u201cYou get up in the morning, and the smell of the coffee brewing and the smell of the soap in the shower are aromatherapy,\u201d Ms. Bosworth said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a bar of soap. It\u2019s something that sets the tone for the whole day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s Pedophilia Comments Cost Him CPAC Role and Book Deal", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Milo Yiannopoulos, a polemical Breitbart editor and unapologetic defender of the alt-right, tested the limits of how far his provocations could go after the publication of a video in which he condones sexual relations with boys as young as 13 and laughs off the seriousness of pedophilia by Roman Catholic priests.Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s comments, which quickly created an uproar online over the weekend, put many conservatives in a deeply uncomfortable position. They have long defended Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s attention-seeking stunts and racially charged antics on the grounds that the left had tried to hypocritically censor his right to free speech.But endorsing pedophilia, it seemed, was more than they could tolerate. The board of the American Conservative Union, which includes veterans of the conservative movement like Grover Norquist and Morton Blackwell, made the decision to revoke Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s speaking slot and condemn his comments on Monday.\u201cWe initially extended the invitation knowing that the free speech issue on college campuses is a battlefield where we need brave, conservative standard-bearers,\u201d Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said in a written statement.Regarding Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s comments, Mr. Schlapp called them \u201cdisturbing\u201d and said Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s explanation of them was insufficient.Late Monday, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that he would hold a news conference on Tuesday to discuss his statements.Mr. Yiannopoulos, who has railed against Muslims, immigrants, transgender people and women\u2019s rights, is a marquee contributor to Breitbart News, where he serves as senior editor. He has amassed a fan base for his stunts and often-outrageous statements. But by Monday afternoon, his future at the website was being intensely debated by top management.One Breitbart journalist, who requested anonymity to describe private deliberations, described divisions in the newsroom over whether Mr. Yiannopoulos could stay on. There was some consensus among staff members that his remarks were more extreme than his usual speech, the journalist said, and executives were discussing by telephone whether his apology was enough to preserve his position at the site.A Breitbart representative declined to comment.But in the tape, the fast-talking polemicist is clear that he has no problem with older men abusing children as young as 13, which he then conflates with relationships between older and younger gay men who are of consenting age.\u201cNo, no, no. You\u2019re misunderstanding what pedophilia means,\u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos says on the tape, in which he is talking to radio hosts in a video chat. \u201cPedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty,\u201d he adds, dismissing the fact that 13-year-olds are children.The notion of consent, he says, is \u201carbitrary and oppressive.\u201dAt one point in the video, an unknown speaker says that the behavior being defended by Mr. Yiannopoulos is akin to molestation by Catholic priests. Mr. Yiannopoulos responds, in an ironic tone, by crediting a priest for having helped develop his sexual technique.Conservatives reacted with near unanimous disgust at the comments. Some expressed bewilderment that conference organizers would extend an invitation to Mr. Yiannopoulos in the first place, given his history of statements that have been offensive to blacks and Muslims, and have generally pushed the bounds of decency. Twitter has banned him.Until now, Mr. Yiannopoulos, a fervent supporter of President Trump, had emerged as something of a hero to many on the right, who saw in him an eager and willing combatant against a culture they believed was too politically correct. He became a star at Breitbart, the hard-right news outlet, and earned the admiration of Stephen K. Bannon, who was its publisher before becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s chief White House strategist.The publisher had encountered mounting criticism of its relationship with Mr. Yiannopoulos. The author Roxane Gay withdrew from her contract for a book with a Simon & Schuster imprint in protest.But in a terse statement late Monday, the publisher said it was canceling the book \u201cafter careful consideration.\u201dIn a statement released through his agent, Mr. Yiannopoulos said: \u201cThe people whose views, concerns and fears I am articulating do not sip white wine and munch canap\u00e9s in gilded salons. And they will not be defeated by the cocktail set running New York publishing. Nor will I.\u201dThe decision is likely to be a costly one for Simon & Schuster, which may not be able to recover the portion of the reported $250,000 advance it had already paid to Mr. Yiannopoulos. \u201cDangerous\u201d had sold just under 50,000 copies, according to his literary agent, Thomas Flannery Jr., who said he planned to find another publisher.An article on Tuesday about the fallout from comments by the Breitbart editor and provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos that seemed to condone sexual relations with boys overstated what is known about the cancellation of his planned lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, this month. The event was canceled after rioting occurred, not necessarily after students rioted. (While students may have been involved, no one has identified and interviewed every person involved in the riots, so their affiliations are not known.)Jeremy W. Peters reported from Washington, Alexandra Alter from San Diego and Michael M. Grynbaum from New York.Advertisement"}

The most outr\u00e9 offering I found over a long stretch of browsing was \u201cAm\u00e9lie.\u201d Which, aside from being in French with English subtitles, is hardly outr\u00e9 at all. After a bit, I decided to relive one of the more uneventful experiences of my early career as a film critic, Garry Marshall\u2019s \u201cRunaway Bride\u201d (1999), which reunited Richard Gere and Julia Roberts almost 10 years after Marshall made some kind of movie history with them in \u201cPretty Woman.\u201d The experience remained uneventful, and the presentation didn\u2019t even have Surround Sound. (On the other hand, the site did lead me down the rabbit hole of last year\u2019s first-rate, eight-hour documentary \u201cO.J.: Made In America,\u201d which I had needed to catch up with.)The mission of Vudu, on the other hand, seems very movie-oriented, with a special emphasis on delivering snazzy presentations of its titles. The company, which began its consumer life in 2008, was bought in 2010 by Walmart. One of Walmart\u2019s most prominent characteristics is that it sells high-definition flat TV displays by the aircraft carrier, so to speak. As do, of course, Costco, Target, Best Buy and the like. But I give Walmart props for attaching to its display-retail business a service with nearly 20,000 movies in high-definition. It\u2019s as if you brought a puppy or kitten home from the animal shelter and the shelter also gave you vouchers for pet food.When you first sign on to Vudu, the site goes through whatever box you\u2019re getting it through (in my case, a PlayStation 4) and tests your internet speed, to see if you can handle Vudu\u2019s truth. Then you set parental controls. You can rent or buy movies in either the standard definition format or, in many cases, in the proprietary HDX format, which delivers movies at close to Blu-ray disc quality. I\u2019m not yet equipped for 4K, or Ultra-High Definition, display, but Vudu\u2019s got that, too.Searching for a high-def experience by which I could gauge HDX, I settled on a big studio movie I hadn\u2019t yet seen, \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d I know the generations that missed out on what was called the sexual revolution need something to make them feel not left out, but I do not think this sort of thing is really the way to go. In any event, it does have very high production values, and the HDX version certainly conveyed them well. The Bach piece in the audio\u2019s rear channels certainly conveyed the refined pain of being a young billionaire with emotional problems. The experience as a whole wasn\u2019t entirely seamless, but that\u2019s not Vudu\u2019s fault.Vudu\u2019s menu pages are so skewed to studio stuff that those looking for more challenging fare might be apt to throw up their hands too soon. Services like Mubi, FilmStruck and Fandor have far more of those types of offerings, but Vudu isn\u2019t completely lacking \u2014 it\u2019s just not immediately visible. Boutique distributors such as Oscilloscope, Kino Lorber and Magnolia have movies on the site. I was able to find, for instance, \u201cMa,\u201d a very unusual dance-in-film directed by and starring Celia Rowlson-Hall, by doing a keyboard search in which, looking for something else, I\u2019d put in the letters \u201cm\u201d and \u201ca.\u201d Lucky, that.Advertisement"}

As long as there are jets and Boeing, business would seem to be steady. But even here workers are bracing for bumps and economic uncertainty over the gritty details of where aviation parts get made and who makes them.The anxiety, said Mr. Bishop, 46, a former deputy county sheriff who voted for Mr. Trump, centers not so much on politics as economics, specifically the intense competition with the French airplane maker Airbus, which competes toe to toe with Boeing for jet orders in countries around the world in a delicate game of narrow cost differences and giant contracts.\u201cSo what does it mean? It means they may cut jobs,\u201d said Kevin Michaels, the managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a specialized market analysis company in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complex field.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got such a huge network here \u2014 anything that curtails exports hurts the entire supply chain,\u201d said John Thornquist, the director of the aerospace office at the Washington State Department of Commerce. \u201cWe\u2019re very vulnerable.\u201dCompanies that sell to Boeing, or sell to other companies that build Boeing components, said that even predicting a trade war was risky, with so many variables \u2014 politics, economics, multiple countries \u2014 all in play. A modern commercial jetliner can have up to six million components that must be engineered and tested to safety standards, even before assembly starts.\u201cYou prepare yourself for the worst and hope for the best,\u201d he said.Other aerospace companies were hesitant to discuss their worries because it might draw unwanted attention \u2014 from competitors, the White House or foreign governments. It is not a good time, several said, to take chances.Boeing declined an interview request for this article, but said in an email statement that talks with the Trump administration were continuing. \u201cThe administration has made it clear that they are pro-economic growth, including in exports and manufacturing jobs,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are engaged with the administration in direct and productive discussion.\u201dIn any small business, optimism and practicality are lifeblood forces, and SmartCells\u2019 president, Bryce L. Betteridge, a chemical engineer, says he believes the company\u2019s future is bright. A trade-secret mix of polymers and wafflelike molds creates the upward bounce of a SmartCells mat, which reduces fatigue for a standing person and can also prevent injuries in falls, he said.The company has already diversified. Amazon warehouse workers and Costco checkout clerks \u2014 both employed by companies that started out in the Seattle area \u2014 stand on SmartCells mats. And Mr. Betteridge mentioned other new markets and ideas with enthusiasm: rifle stocks, nursing home floors, playgrounds. No idea for a better cushion seems beyond reach.But he said the company\u2019s strategy for the future was shifting on the assumption that international trade under Mr. Trump would become more difficult. For one thing, he said, he has now discarded any thought of expanding the company into China, Mexico or anywhere else where SmartCells\u2019 products could be made and brought into the United States for sale. \u201cThat benefit is going to go away, I anticipate,\u201d Mr. Betteridge said.And it is simply too expensive to export heavy, relatively low-cost products like cushion mats to other countries from Washington, he said. That means the company\u2019s growth in foreign markets, when or if it happens, will probably come through licensing the technology to manufacturers abroad, which will then hire local workers. Sales and marketing positions might be added here in Chehalis, Mr. Betteridge said, but no added manufacturing jobs would be needed.But a pressure to \u201cbuy American\u201d coming from the White House could also be a powerful force, he and other industry leaders said, if companies like Boeing ultimately shift a greater proportion of their airplane component purchases to suppliers in the United States. Currently, Boeing spends about 80 percent of its $40 billion annual supply-chain budget in the United States, and exports about 75 percent of its products.\u201cSome of the suppliers in Puget Sound might actually be rooting for this, because in the long run it could benefit them,\u201d Mr. Michaels, the industry analyst, said.Kurt Mullins, 56, a former lumber millworker who has been at SmartCells for about a year and a half, often installs floor cushioning systems at Boeing, where he hears the worries of workers there, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d Mr. Mullins said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Road Trip to Death Valley: Salt Flats, Chilly Nights and Kitsch", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerI exited my tent to fetch another pair of socks to put on and was amazed by the star-filled sky, an endless sea of tiny pinpricks of light. And the silence. The yelp of a coyote somewhere on the salt flats, the sound of a fork against a metal plate from another camper, even the sound of a page turning when I was reading that night: The slightest noise was amplified tenfold in the deafening silence of the desert.I had planned to make the classic coastal drive from Los Angeles to Big Sur, but falling rocks and mudslides had rendered parts of Highway 1 impassable. The upside of that situation is that I was forced to get creative: How best to spend a few days on the road exploring the vastness of the southern half of California, embracing its prodigiousness and quirkiness, all without spending too much money? I pieced it together over the course of three days and was able to check out, among other things, one of the nation\u2019s most obscure and unexpected opera houses, a bizarre, deserted seaside resort town, and, of course, Death Valley, the lowest, driest and hottest place in the country.After passing the Hollow Hills Wilderness area, I went miles without seeing a single car on Death Valley Road; the isolation of the desert became readily apparent. Miles of sand and dirt filled the landscape, scrappy desert plants and the Kingston and Avawatz mountain ranges rising out of the flatness. I carried on over the California-Nevada border into Pahrump, where I stayed in a cheap $61 room at a Holiday Inn Express before heading out the next morning.(You should pay for your park visit, too. Admission is $25, payable at automated stations throughout the park. There are numerous free campsites, but many of the larger sites with services like water and toilets require a fee. I stayed at the Texas Springs campground and paid $16.)Images of the desert, the bottle tree farm, and Mr. Knight\u2019s colorful monument stayed with me as I left Niland and drove toward the Mexican border, planning to loop around to San Diego. They seemed to embody what I love most about California: a vast loneliness that is both crushing and comforting, and speaks to the artist in all of us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Marketers, TV Sets Are an Invaluable Pair of Eyes", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Ellen Milz and her family were watching the Olympics last summer, their TV was watching them.Ms. Milz, 48, who lives with her husband and three children in Chicago, had agreed to be a panelist for a company called TVision Insights, which monitored her viewing habits \u2014 and whether her eyes flicked down to her phone during the commercials, whether she was smiling or frowning \u2014 through a device on top of her TV.\u201cThe marketing company said, \u2018We\u2019re going to ask you to put this device in your home, connect it to your TV and they\u2019re going to watch you for the Olympics to see how you like it, what sports, your expression, who\u2019s around,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Whatever, I have nothing to hide.\u2019\u201dMs. Milz acknowledged that she had initially found the idea odd, but that those qualms had quickly faded.\u201cIt\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d she said, comparing it to the Nest security cameras in her home. She said she had initially received $60 for participating and an additional $230 after four to six months.TVision \u2014 which has worked with the Weather Channel, NBC and the Disney ABC Television Group \u2014 is one of several companies that have entered living rooms in recent years, emerging with new, granular ways for marketers to understand how people are watching television and, in particular, commercials. The appeal of this information has soared as Americans rapidly change their viewing habits, streaming an increasing number of shows weeks or months after they first air, on devices as varied as smartphones, laptops and Roku boxes, not to mention TVs.\u201cThe big thing for TV advertisers and the networks is: Are you actually looking at the screen or not?\u201d said Dan Schiffman, the chief revenue officer of TVision (pronounced Tee-Vision). \u201cWhat you looked at is interesting, but the fact that you looked away is arguably the most interesting.\u201dMr. Schiffman founded TVision, a 30-person start-up, with a classmate from the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T.But some industry executives have criticized Nielsen\u2019s methods as outdated. Nielsen selects homes at random to represent the nation\u2019s viewing audience, and measures who is watching what shows, mostly through meters connected to the sets, as well as diaries in select markets and digital tracking of certain ad-supported programs on tablets and phones.\u201cNielsen will remain the currency for the time being because it is agreed upon as the thing everyone uses,\u201d said Alan Wurtzel, an adviser at NBCUniversal and its former head of research. \u201cBut as the world becomes more complex, as it is, many more additional supplemental or complementary measures will come into play.\u201dInformation gathered by companies like TVision can help advertisers steer marketing toward shows with the most engaged audiences, not just the largest ones. And for networks, it could make a show with a committed and loyal audience as valuable as one that attracts a larger but more casual set of viewers.TVision has recruited 2,000 households, or roughly 7,500 people, in the Boston, Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth areas. The company said the information was transmitted without storing images or video and collected anonymously.Mr. Schiffman said the data would show, for example, \u201cPerson No. 124 in Household 6 was paying attention this second and not paying attention the next to a certain program or advertisement.\u201dSymphony and TVision both use technology that can recognize shows and ads through the audio or digital tags the content contains. Consumers are most likely familiar with this type of technology through the song-recognition app Shazam.Another ratings company, RealityMine, has assembled a panel of 5,000 people in the United States whom it said it paid less than $90 a year, who either have its app, a \u201chome meter\u201d plugged into their internet networks or both. In some instances, its meter may capture activity across 25 devices in a household, such as tablet, phone, Xbox, Wii, Apple TV and Google Chromecast.The aim is \u201cunderstanding what is the media day and the life of the consumer today,\u201d said Charlie Buchwalter, the chief executive of Symphony, which has worked with companies including NBCUniversal.Mr. Schiffman said that while some people were wary of TVision\u2019s technology, they were often placated after learning that it was not storing images or videos.During the Olympics, Ms. Milz wore a Fitbit so that NBC could see how her heart rate changed while she watched certain events.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to understand where people really are and what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re watching, how are they interacting, and ideally after that, how is that changing their behavior or affecting their behavior,\u201d said Jonathan Steuer, the chief research officer of Omnicom Media Group, which oversees media buying for advertisers.By measuring the level of attention a person is paying to a given show, TVision believes it can help bolster niche programs and smaller networks. For example, Mr. Schiffman said the company had found that the series \u201cLucifer,\u201d on Fox, commanded better attention metrics from viewers than \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d on CBS, even though \u201cBig Bang\u201d is one of the TV shows rated highest by Nielsen.\u201cPeople don\u2019t just tune into \u2018Lucifer.\u2019 They DVR it and watch it when they come home,\u201d he said, adding that viewers tend to be focused on the show and stay in the room when it is on.The Weather Channel used TVision\u2019s data in the fall to give it an edge over the news and lifestyle shows it is normally compared against by advertisers. It showed its audience for weather news as \u201clean forward, lean-in viewers,\u201d said Indira Venkat, who oversees research at the channel.\u201cWhat is oftentimes missing is the quality of the audience,\u201d Ms. Venkat said about Nielsen viewing data. \u201cYes, you\u2019re getting audience, but what are they doing in today\u2019s era of multitasking?\u201dFollow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter @Sapna.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deep in Brazil\u2019s Amazon, Exploring the Ruins of Ford\u2019s Fantasyland", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReporter\u2019s Notebook\u201cThis street was a looters\u2019 paradise, with thieves taking furniture, doorknobs, anything the Americans left behind,\u201d said Expedito Duarte de Brito, 71, a retired milkman who dwells in one of the homes built for Ford managers in what was planned to be a utopian plantation town. \u201cI thought, \u2018Either I occupy this piece of history or it joins the other ruins of Fordl\u00e2ndia.\u2019\u201dThat finally changed when I boarded a riverboat this year in Santar\u00e9m, an outpost at the confluence of the Amazon and Tapaj\u00f3s rivers, and made the six-hour trip to the place where Ford, one of the world\u2019s richest men, tried turning a colossal swath of Brazilian jungle into a Midwest fantasyland.I explored the outpost on foot, wandering the ruins and talking to gold prospectors, farmers and descendants of plantation workers who live here. Hardly a lost city, Fordl\u00e2ndia is home to about 2,000 people, some who live in the crumbling structures built nearly a century ago.Ford, the automobile manufacturer who is considered a founder of American industrial mass-production methods, hatched his plan for Fordl\u00e2ndia in a bid to produce his own source of the rubber needed for making tires and car parts like valves, hoses and gaskets.These endeavors on the other side of the world devastated Brazil\u2019s rubber economy. But Ford despised relying on the Europeans, fearing a proposal by Winston Churchill to create a rubber cartel. So, in a move that pleased Brazilian officials, Ford acquired a giant stretch of land in the Amazon.Despite such setbacks, Ford constructed an American-style town, which he wanted inhabited by Brazilians hewing to what he considered American values.Employees moved into clapboard bungalows \u2014 designed, of course, in Michigan \u2014 some of which are still standing. Streetlamps illuminated concrete sidewalks. Portions of these footpaths persist in the town, near red fire hydrants, in the shadow of decaying dance halls and crumbling warehouses.\u201cIt turns out Detroit isn\u2019t the only place where Ford produced ruins,\u201d said Guilherme Lisboa, 67, the owner of a small inn called the Pousada Americana.Going even further in Ford\u2019s quest for utopia, so-called sanitation squads operated across the outpost, killing stray dogs, draining puddles of water where malaria-transmitting mosquitoes could multiply and checking employees for venereal diseases.\u201cWith a surety of purpose and incuriosity about the world that seems all too familiar, Ford deliberately rejected expert advice and set out to turn the Amazon into the Midwest of his imagination,\u201d Mr. Grandin, the historian, wrote in his account of the town.These days, the ruins of Fordl\u00e2ndia stand as testament to the folly of trying to bend the jungle to the will of man.Seeking to promote the automobile as a form of recreation \u2014 along with the golf course, tennis courts, a movie theater and swimming pools \u2014 managers laid out nearly 30 miles of roads around Fordl\u00e2ndia. But cars are mostly absent on the town\u2019s muddy lanes, eclipsed by the motorbikes found in towns across the Amazon.By the end of World War II, it was clear that cultivating rubber trees around Fordl\u00e2ndia could not be profitable in the face of leaf blight and competition from synthetic rubber and Asian plantations freed from Japanese domination.After Ford turned the town over to Brazil\u2019s government in 1945, officials transferred Fordl\u00e2ndia from one public agency to another, largely for unsuccessful experiments in tropical agriculture. The town went into a seemingly perpetual state of decline.\u201cNothing happens here, and that\u2019s how I like it,\u201d said Joaquim Pereira da Silva, 73, a farmer from Minas Gerais State who followed his star to Fordl\u00e2ndia in 1997. Now he lives on Palm Avenue in an old American house he bought for 20,000 reais (about $6,670) from a squatter who fixed it up.\u201cThe Americans had no idea about rubber but they knew how to build things to last,\u201d he said.Scavenging material left by the Americans, he fashioned a fishing lantern from old car parts and a spice grinder from discarded machinery. Mr. dos Santos expressed mixed views of Fordl\u00e2ndia under American stewardship, growing up in the years after Ford unloaded the town.\u201cThis place in Ford\u2019s day was clean, no insects, no animals, no jungle in the town,\u201d said Mr. dos Santos, one of 11 children born to a family that depended on the rubber plantation.\u201cMy father worked for them,\u201d he said, \u201cand he did what they ordered him to do. Workers are like dogs: They obey.\u201dBut to Ford\u2019s dismay, sometimes they didn\u2019t obey.Managers tried enforcing the alcohol prohibition, but workers simply hopped on boats to a so-called island of innocence nearby with bars and brothels. And in 1930, workers fed up with eating Ford\u2019s diet of oatmeal, canned peaches and brown rice in a sweltering dining hall staged a full-scale riot.The Amazon offered its own challenges to the Americans. Some couldn\u2019t adapt to the conditions here, suffering nervous breakdowns. One drowned when a storm on the Tapaj\u00f3s River toppled his boat. Another manager left after three of his children died from tropical fevers.Ford might have avoided such tragedies, and the ruinous management of the plantation, if he had sought counsel from specialists in caring for rubber trees or scholars of the Amazon\u2019s capacity to thwart grandiose ventures. But he seemed to abhor learning from the past.Paula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Anti-Trump Activist Taking On Retailers", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Sitting in a basement office that she rents by the hour, Shannon Coulter ticks off the activities she gave up in defiance of President Donald J. Trump: renting movies with her husband on Amazon, and shopping at Nordstrom, Macy\u2019s and other retailers that sell Ivanka Trump\u2019s products.A Nordstrom bag sat on a nearby table. It represents a victory lap of sorts for Ms. Coulter, who has almost single-handedly spearheaded a retail revolt against the president and his family. She was wearing a new silver Elizabeth and James lariat necklace purchased at the department store soon after it scrubbed Ms. Trump\u2019s name from its website.\u201cThe goal,\u201d Ms. Coulter said, \u201ccame originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscience.\u201dIt\u2019s been a wild ride these past few months for Ms. Coulter, who runs her shoestring movement from her home, or from cheerfully decorated work spaces like this one \u2014 surrounded by bright-blue furniture, clam chairs and decorative pillows that feel more Silicon Valley than anti-administration war room.Thousands of people have contacted the stores Ms. Coulter has on her boycott list, including Macy\u2019s and Amazon. Retailers including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and T.J. Maxx have backed away from products connected to Ms. Trump, the president\u2019s oldest daughter, since Ms. Coulter\u2019s efforts began. A herd of activists and celebrities, including the feminist writer Gloria Steinem, the Olympic diver Greg Louganis and the actress Lucy Lawless of \u201cXena: Warrior Princess,\u201d have expressed support.The attention has transformed Ms. Coulter, 45, a digital marketing specialist, into the unlikely general of the digital army now supporting her campaign, Grab Your Wallet.\u201cPeople describe me as an activist in media coverage, I don\u2019t know who they\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything this organized or structured or purposeful.\u201dThe new role has taken up much of her time, and has made her the target of criticism and attacks from Trump supporters. She\u2019s lost count of how many times she has been called a \u201cbully\u201d or a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d The abuse gets more menacing with each victory; a recent email included her mother\u2019s name in the subject line, with threats to publish more of her personal information.In the latest twist, the boycott has drawn Ms. Coulter, a self-described progressive liberal, into a growing debate over whether targeting Ms. Trump is sexist.And she said she worries that people will think she is profiting from the venture. Ms. Coulter was particularly upset when a knockoff \u201cGrab Your Wallet\u201d group sold clothing and other merchandise on Facebook. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a T-shirt, we don\u2019t have stickers, nothing,\u201d she said, adding that she does not accept compensation from companies, or donations.\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us envisioned that some of the things that have happened would happen,\u201d said Sue Atencio, who helped Ms. Coulter get the site started.In many ways, Ms. Coulter has embraced her new position. She answers emails at all hours and scours Twitter for tips on companies to add, or remove, from the boycott list. Then there are the phone calls \u2014 lots and lots of phone calls \u2014 from angry Trump supporters or journalists or the companies that want to get off her list.There is no doubt that it has changed her life. She doesn\u2019t sleep or socialize as often as she used to. Most of her work on Grab Your Wallet is done after she eats dinner with her husband, taking up what free time she has.\u201cShe went underground, basically,\u201d said Amie Penwell, a fellow San Francisco resident who hasn\u2019t seen much of her friend of seven years recently.The negative attention has made Ms. Coulter careful about her privacy. She insisted on meeting at the work space for an interview, to avoid having a reporter at her home, out of fear that it could be targeted. She would not let her husband, whom she met online in 2010, be interviewed.Born in Indiana, Ms. Coulter studied journalism at Penn State. She said she began her career by \u201cpiggybacking\u201d on the Bay Area\u2019s technology boom, helping start-ups with their email marketing.A year ago she started her own agency, DoubleKnown, which helps executives and small businesses build their online presence through blog posts, social media feeds and other digital tools. The company has one other employee and a handful of education and technology clients, but has stopped taking on new accounts since Grab Your Wallet took off.Political activism has not been a big part of Ms. Coulter\u2019s life since college, when she spoke at a rally raising awareness about violence against women. Her most recent organized effort came after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015, when she circulated a list of lawmakers who had voted against tougher gun control measures.\u201cMaybe that gave me a taste of what something like this would be like,\u201d she said, describing herself as a chronic list maker. \u201cI like the efficiency of them.\u201dAfter becoming incensed by the video, Ms. Coulter began searching retailers\u2019 websites for Trump-branded products and collecting the names on a spreadsheet. Wondering who else might be interested in a boycott, she looked at Twitter, and found Ms. Atencio, who had tweeted \u201cfashion not fascism.\u201dMs. Coulter contacted her and suggested they announce the boycott together.Since then, most of the work has fallen to Ms. Coulter, though she refers to Ms. Atencio as her \u201cspiritual guide\u201d and sounding board. Ms. Atencio, 59, sees herself as the less visible half of a musical duo. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the Garfunkel and Shannon is Paul Simon,\u201d Ms. Atencio said.Grab Your Wallet now includes a list of places to shop and not shop, and a short script for people who want to call companies to complain. As many as 32,000 people visit her site in an hour, Ms. Coulter said. When the women\u2019s marches took place across the country in January, 350,000 people arrived during a 24-hour period.In early February, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus removed Ms. Trump\u2019s name from their websites. Employees at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls were instructed not to display Ivanka Trump products and to throw her signs in the trash.None of the retailers credited Grab Your Wallet with their decision \u2014 the department stores blamed poor sales \u2014 and it is not possible to know to what degree Ms. Coulter and her followers have influenced the companies\u2019 decision making. But in the waning days of January, Trump-related complaints, many of which mentioned Grab Your Wallet, were Nordstrom\u2019s most common customer feedback, according to a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to speak publicly. Nordstrom said it did not have \u201cspecific numbers\u201d on the number of customers it had heard from.Monitoring those spikes, updating her list and responding to emails, tweets and press inquiries have become Ms. Coulter\u2019s second full-time job.\u201cMy life is so completely here,\u201d she said, gesturing to her MacBook, \u201cthat it all just sort of overlaps and is an endless stream of emails and tweets and Facebook posts.\u201dShe does get some help from volunteers, like the woman who helps run the legitimate Grab Your Wallet Facebook group, which has more than 12,000 members. But for the most part, Ms. Coulter is on her own.That means the threats and negative attention are also directed largely at her.

{"Headline": "Which Dystopian Novel Got It Right: Orwell\u2019s \u20181984\u2019 or Huxley\u2019s \u2018Brave New World\u2019?", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBookendsHuxley, on the other hand, writing almost two decades earlier than Orwell (his former Eton pupil, as it happened), foresaw a world that included space travel; private helicopters; genetically engineered test tube babies; enhanced birth control; an immensely popular drug that appears to combine the best features of Valium and Ecstasy; hormone-laced chewing gum that seems to work the way Viagra does; a full sensory entertainment system that outdoes IMAX; and maybe even breast implants. (The book is a little unclear on this point, but in \u201cBrave New World\u201d the highest compliment you can pay a woman is to call her \u201cpneumatic.\u201d)Huxley was not entirely serious about this. He began \u201cBrave New World\u201d as a parody of H.G. Wells, whose writing he detested, and it remained a book that means to be as playful as it is prophetic. And yet his novel much more accurately evokes the country we live in now, especially in its depiction of a culture preoccupied with sex and mindless pop entertainment, than does Orwell\u2019s more ominous book, which seems to be imagining someplace like North Korea. Or it did until Donald Trump was inaugurated. All of a sudden, as many commentators have pointed out, there were almost daily echoes of Orwell in the news, and \u201c1984\u201d began shooting up the Amazon best-seller list. The most obvious connection to Orwell was the new president\u2019s repeated insistence that even his most pointless and transparent lies were in fact true, and then his adviser Kellyanne Conway\u2019s explanation that these statements were not really falsehoods but, rather, \u201calternative facts.\u201d As any reader of \u201c1984\u201d knows, this is exactly Big Brother\u2019s standard of truth: The facts are whatever the leader says they are. If you\u2019re a rereader, thumbing through your old Penguin paperback, those endless wars in \u201c1984,\u201d during which the enemy keeps changing \u2014 now Eurasia, now Eastasia \u2014 no longer seem as far-fetched as they once did, and neither do the book\u2019s organized hate rallies, in which the citizenry works itself into a frenzy against nameless foreigners. Even President Trump\u2019s weirdly impoverished, 12-year-old\u2019s vocabulary has an analogue in \u201c1984,\u201d in which Newspeak isn\u2019t just the medium of double talk; it\u2019s a language busily trying to shed itself of as many words (and as much complexity) as possible.So was Orwell right after all? Well, not yet. For one thing, the political system of \u201c1984\u201d is an exaggerated version of anticapitalist, Stalin-era Communism, and Trump\u2019s philosophy is anything but that. He would be much more comfortable in Huxley\u2019s world, which is based on rampant consumerism and where hordes of genetically modified losers happily tend to the needs of the winners.Huxley believed that his version of dystopia was the more plausible one. In a 1949 letter, thanking Orwell for sending him a copy of \u201c1984,\u201d he wrote that he really didn\u2019t think all that torture and jackbooting was necessary to subdue a population, and that he believed his own book offered a better solution. All you need to do, he said, is teach people to love their servitude. The totalitarian rulers in Huxley\u2019s book do this not by oppressing their citizens but by giving them exactly what they want, or what they think they want \u2014 which is basically sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2014 and lulling them into complacency. The system entails a certain Trump-like suspicion of science and dismissal of history, but that\u2019s a price the inhabitants of Huxley\u2019s world happily pay. They don\u2019t mourn their lost liberty, the way Orwell\u2019s Winston Smith does; they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s gone.The last few months have been hard, no doubt, the news more distressing by the hour, but there is still something perversely groupthinkish in the fact that the impulse of resistance has homed in on the same book, and that a measure of opposition to the horrors of the Trump administration is the climb of \u201c1984\u201d to No. 1 on Amazon. There is much in Orwell\u2019s novel, in fact, that translates poorly into the contemporary moment. From its texture of material deprivation, the loosely packed cigarettes and boiled cabbages recalling wartime rationing in Britain, to its portrayal of Ingsoc, Big Brother and various Ministries (Truth, Peace, Love, Plenty), all of which assume control by a heavily centralized State, it is a work very much of the \u201940s as experienced by an English intellectual. In \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death,\u201d the American media critic Neil Postman in fact argued that Huxley\u2019s novel was far more relevant than Orwell\u2019s when it came to the United States, where the dominant mode of control over people was through entertainment, distraction, and superficial pleasure rather than through overt modes of policing and strict control over food supplies, at least when it came to managing the middle classes. Three decades after Postman\u2019s account, when we can add reality television, the internet and social media to the deadly amusements available, \u201cBrave New World\u201d can still seem strikingly relevant in its depiction of the relentless pursuit of pleasure. From the use of soma as a kind of happiness drug to the erasure of the past not so much as a threat to government, as is the case in Orwell\u2019s dystopia, but as simply irrelevant (\u201cHistory is bunk\u201d), Huxley marked out amusement and superficiality as the buttons that control behavior. His relentless focus on the body, too, seems inspired, his understanding of what Michel Foucault identified as \u201cbiopolitics,\u201d extending to the individual body as well as to entire populations and, in \u201cBrave New World,\u201d playing out as a eugenic system based on caste, class, race, looks and size. As for his depiction of the \u201csavage reservation\u201d in New Mexico, this seems to foreshadow the fetishization of the natural on the part of one of the most artifice-ridden populations in the history of the world. A great deal funnier, subtler and darker than Orwell\u2019s book, Huxley\u2019s satire nevertheless has its limitations. A World State? Games of escalator squash? In any case, why stop at one of two books, as if the literary realm must mimic the denuded, lesser-of-two-evils choices of electoral politics? There are other powerful fictional dystopias that speak to the United States of today, including a significant portion of the oeuvre of Philip K. Dick and Octavia E. Butler. There is J.G. Ballard\u2019s hallucinatory Reagan-era \u201cHello America,\u201d with a future United States that has many contending presidents, including President Manson, who plays nuclear roulette in Las Vegas. Why not read Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Road\u201d and Sandra Newman\u2019s \u201cThe Country of Ice Cream Star\u201d and Anna North\u2019s \u201cAmerica Pacifica\u201d and Emily St. John Mandel\u2019s \u201cStation Eleven\u201d and Claire Vaye Watkins\u2019s \u201cGold Fame Citrus\u201d and Vanessa Veselka\u2019s \u201cZazen\u201d and Paolo Bacigalupi\u2019s \u201cThe Water Knife\u201d?

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Holiday Quarter Doesn\u2019t Match High Expectations", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon showed the kind of growth over the holidays that most big companies would die for, as it continued to suck away sales from crumbling bricks-and-mortar retailers. But it was not enough.Despite a 55 percent increase in profit, Amazon\u2019s revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 was not as strong as Wall Street had predicted, and an after-hours sell-off by investors dropped the company\u2019s share price more than 4 percent.\u201cThere were great expectations, and they failed to impress,\u201d said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Exchange Traded Funds, which owns Amazon shares.Still, even if investors were disappointed, Amazon\u2019s long-term growth story was still intact. The company is gradually taking market share from offline retailers, with aggressive pricing, a wider selection and speedy shipping.The company is building new warehouses at a torrid clip, pushing its fulfillment centers closer and closer to population centers so it can get orders more quickly to customers. During 2016, it added a net of 26 new warehouses, compared with a net addition of 14 warehouses in 2015.\u201cAutomation is relentless, and it\u2019s going to accelerate,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cYou saw what happened to retail store sales this past Christmas. Amazon and online sales is killing traditional retail.\u201dFor the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, Amazon said its net income was $749 million, or $1.54 a share, up from $482 million, or $1 a share, during the same period a year earlier. The company\u2019s revenue rose to $43.7 billion from $35.7 billion a year earlier.Amazon\u2019s profit soared in the quarter in part because of the growth of Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, which runs many technology functions for customers through Amazon\u2019s data centers. Web Services revenue jumped 47 percent to $3.54 billion, while operating income increased almost 60 percent to $926 million.The company\u2019s earnings were well ahead of the average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters of $1.35 a share. Revenue was a different story, falling short of the $44.68 billion average revenue estimate of analysts.Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call that one reason the company\u2019s revenue diverged from expectations was because of fluctuations in foreign currency, which can impact the company\u2019s results from overseas businesses.While Amazon had told analysts to expect a favorable impact of $230 million on its revenue from currency fluctuations, the changes produced a negative impact of $558 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bow and Cooper in \u2018Children of Divorce\u2019: Poor Little Silent Rich Kids", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVD\u201cThe past is a foreign country,\u201d the British novelist L. P. Hartley wrote. \u201cThey do things differently there.\u201d In silent movies, you might say they act differently. The look is all.\u201cChildren of Divorce,\u201d a 1927 movie newly refurbished in a dual-format edition by Flicker Alley, stars Clara Bow. Born in Brooklyn, Bow, then 21, Bow was Hollywood\u2019s prototypical flapper, the epitome of silent screen vivacity, known as the \u201cIt Girl\u201d for her evident sex appeal. Her male foil in the film, Gary Cooper, was by contrast something of a pomaded stiff, uncomfortably awaiting the introduction of the talking pictures that would usher in his mellow yet authoritative drawl.Bow, Cooper and Esther Ralston (who plays Bow\u2019s childhood friend, described as the richest girl in America) all impersonate poor little rich kids, the products of broken marriages, deprived of love by their self-absorbed, high-society parents. (Bow\u2019s mother is played by the future Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper.) Given the inappropriate romantic pairing that ensues, the movie is actually an inadvertent argument for divorce. But it\u2019s mainly a showcase for Bow, a study in wide eyes and tousled hair.The unexpected subtlety and pathos of Bow\u2019s final close-ups are both a tribute to her and to the skill of Josef von Sternberg, then a Paramount contract director, who filled in \u2014 uncredited \u2014 for Lloyd. Sternberg is justly known as a director of actresses, especially Marlene Dietrich, but three years later, he would coax a terrific performance out of Cooper, playing opposite Dietrich in her first Hollywood movie, \u201cMorocco.\u201dSternberg\u2019s seriousness can hardly be overstated. \u201cThe Salvation Hunters\u201d announces itself as dedicated to \u201cthe derelicts of the earth.\u201d But the movie\u2019s opening third, shot in and around the mud flats of San Pedro Bay, in Southern California, is nothing less than sensational, mapping the terrain with unexpected close-ups and inventive angles. The movie\u2019s human element is introduced as an abstract reflection; the most active character is the dredge popping in and out of frame as it mechanically scoops mud from the harbor.Observing the scene from a pier in the bay, the Girl and the Boy passively bond over and take charge of an abused youngster: the Child. In the movie\u2019s second segment, this de facto family relocates to the city, finding shelter in an underpopulated bordello apparently controlled by an underemployed pimp. The Girl and the Boy continue to moon around \u2014 their movement takes on the quality of a lugubrious dance \u2014 until, prompted by the example of the prostitute next door, not to mention the Child\u2019s hunger, the Girl decides to apply kohl to her eyes and put herself on the street.Ms. Hale \u201cfelt nothing during the making of the film, nor was this a requirement,\u201d Sternberg wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThe emotions infused into her image were caused by the movement of a dredge, reflections in water, chalk scribbles on walls, chewing gum, real estate signs, sea gulls, and a cracked mirror in which she penciled her eyebrows with the charred end of a match.\u201d Her performance was created by the context in which it was set \u2014 and it worked.In the movie\u2019s final third, the Girl, the Boy and the Child spend an afternoon in the country along with their depraved neighbors. The land is unspoiled, save for a commercial sign that reads, \u201cHere Your Dreams Come True.\u201d Amazingly they do. The spell that has paralyzed the couple is broken.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

O\u2019Neil, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. Yet she called it a positive development for the region, showing \u201cthe anticorruption movement in Latin America is gaining ground.\u201dIn Lima, the capital, the legacy of Odebrecht is hard to miss. A statue of Christ with arms outspread that overlooks the city\u2019s coast was donated by the company.But Odebrecht has also reaped the benefits of its connections to the country. The Interoceanic Highway, for example, begun under Mr. Toledo\u2019s administration, cost $4.5 billion, four times over budget. The overruns were approved by an official who is also under investigation by prosecutors.If Mr. Toledo is apprehended and convicted, he would be the second Peruvian president behind bars, after Alberto K. Fujimori, the country\u2019s former dictator, who was convicted of human rights abuses.\u201cFor Peru, like any other country, even the possibility of having two presidents as prisoners is an embarrassment,\u201d Marisol P\u00e9rez Tello, the country\u2019s justice minister, said in an interview. But she added, \u201cI think this is an important moment to think about our ability to institutionalize the fight against corruption.\u201dSpeaking to reporters last week, the country\u2019s attorney general said a former lawmaker, Otto Bula, had funneled Odebrecht money through an intermediary to the campaign.Mr. Bula is currently under arrest on charges of having paid about $4.6 million in bribes for various projects in Colombia, including a road linking the country\u2019s interior to the Magdalena River and Caribbean highway known as the Ruta del Sol.Mr. Santos had said he did not do anything wrong and is interested in a full investigation of the case.

{"Headline": "Angling for a Comeback, Democratic Governors Sharpen Focus on Jobs", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Democrats battle President Trump on a multiplying array of issues, from immigration and climate change to health care and transgender rights, a group of Democratic governors is pressing the party to set one concern above all the rest: jobs.Gathered in Washington for a conference of the National Governors Association, Democratic leaders from the states expressed optimism that Mr. Trump had opened the way for a Democratic comeback by governing from the hard right and in a haphazard manner.But they also warned that voters might not embrace Democrats as an alternative to Mr. Trump unless they presented themselves convincingly as champions of job creation, which they struggled to do in last year\u2019s presidential election. Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity, several governors said, will not necessarily usher Democrats back to power on its own \u2014 they must frame all their priorities in economic terms.Gov. Gina M. Raimondo of Rhode Island, a Democrat who is in her first term, said her party had too often failed to put jobs and economic opportunity at the forefront of its agenda. Democrats had erred, she said, by treating jobs merely as one issue in a \u201ccheck list\u201d of positions.In an interview, Ms. Raimondo mimicked the rote approach: \u201cAre you pro-choice? Check. Are you pro-transgender rights? Check. Are you pro-gay rights? Check. Are you pro-renewable energy? Check. Are you pro-good jobs? Check.\u201d\u201cMy own view is, we have to say: The whole game is job growth,\u201d Ms. Raimondo said. \u201cPeople feel left behind because they are left behind. People feel the playing field isn\u2019t level because it\u2019s not level. So let\u2019s level it.\u201dMs. Raimondo, 45, a former venture capitalist, stressed that she did not believe the party should change its liberal platform on social issues and called for fierce resistance to Mr. Trump.But she urged Democrats to define their agenda broadly as a matter of pursuing economic growth, \u201cequally distributed for people of color, women, immigrants, regardless of sexual orientation, who you love.\u201dGov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, the vice chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said Democrats had to make job growth their organizing theme on all subjects, including immigration and the Affordable Care Act. The most effective attacks on Mr. Trump, he said, would cast the president\u2019s policies as harmful to the economy.Behind closed doors, too, Democratic governors prodded the party to compete harder with Mr. Trump on kitchen-table issues. The president won a slim victory last fall in large part because his platform of trade protectionism and immigration restriction appealed to blue-collar whites in the Midwest, some of whom had voted for Democrats in the past.Mr. Inslee, who won a second term in November, said there was \u201cbroad-scale agreement that our economic message was not successful in the presidential race,\u201d and that the party needed a far more pointed appeal on economic matters.During a private meeting of Democratic governors on Saturday morning that included the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado argued that Democrats needed a clear positive appeal about job growth. In the debate over the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Hickenlooper, 65, said Democrats should highlight the health care-related jobs at stake, according to people who attended the meeting.Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Mr. Hickenlooper, confirmed his remarks.A number of the Democratic governors pressing for a stronger sales pitch on jobs are seen as potential presidential candidates, among them Mr. Inslee, Ms. Raimondo and Mr. Hickenlooper.And mirroring the role Republican governors played during President Barack Obama\u2019s time in office, Democrats in the states have vowed to rally opposition to Mr. Trump and battle his initiatives through legislation and lawsuits challenging his administration.In some respects, the opposition to Mr. Trump from blue-state leaders may be even more strenuous than what Mr. Obama faced from Republican governors. Unlike at the outset of Mr. Obama\u2019s term, when some Republican governors flirted with accommodating a popular new president, there is little apparent appetite among Democrats for conciliating Mr. Trump.But Democrats have suffered dire losses on the state level and now hold 16 governorships, most of them in solidly blue states like New York, California and Oregon. The party\u2019s governors are looking to the 2018 elections as a crucial opportunity to recover their standing in state capitals.Party leaders in Washington, like Ms. Pelosi, have also come to see winning governorships as a priority because of the power many state executives have in drawing congressional district lines. After the 2010 elections, Republicans had extensive control over the process of mapping congressional districts, helping them achieve a viselike grip on the House.While Democrats are hopeful that they can exploit the political backlash against Mr. Trump and his policies, there is considerable disagreement within the party about how best to deliver a message of contrast with the president.Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who won re-election last year in a state that Mr. Trump carried easily, said he believed Democrats would have to do more than oppose the president to return to power.\u201cI think we as Democrats have to have a narrative of what we\u2019re for, not just also what we\u2019re against,\u201d Mr. Bullock said.The jobs-first approach that many Democratic governors favor was on prominent display during a news conference on Saturday morning at a hotel in downtown Washington. A lineup of Democratic state executives took aim at the Trump administration, denouncing Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies.Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, who is the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, accused Mr. Trump of ignoring his campaign pledge to move quickly on a huge infrastructure program. And he branded Republican health care policies as job killers.\u201cWhat have they passed?\u201d Mr. Malloy asked about the Republicans. \u201cWhere is the jobs bill? Where is a better health care plan?\u201dSpeaking alongside Mr. Malloy, Mr. McAuliffe said Mr. Trump had caused \u201ctremendous damage\u201d with his approach to immigration, including the travel ban. Addressing himself to Mr. Trump, Mr. McAuliffe said, \u201cMr. President, spend your time on doing what you said you would do, and grow this economy.\u201d\u201cYou are hurting our ability to create jobs in our states,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to stop. Discrimination breeds hatred, and hatred is bad for the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anicka Yi Is Inventing a New Kind of Conceptual Art", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byONE AFTERNOON IN mid-December, the artist Anicka Yi traveled uptown to a Columbia University lab, where for the seventh time in as many weeks she had an appointment with a pair of biologists in preparation for an upcoming solo exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum.Atop a table in a whiteboard-lined conference room sat a hexagonal mass of agar, a sort of seafood Jell-O. Satisfyingly dense and amber in color, it looked like something that might have been plated as a second course at a molecular gastronomy restaurant. The artist herself wasn\u2019t entirely sure what would become of it. A Ph.D. candidate in nutritional biology patiently dislodged the strange matter from a mold with a letter opener and then held it up in the air. It wobbled. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have gravity issues here,\u201d Yi said. \u201cI mean, this would be fine if it was for a floor-mounted piece, but on a wall?\u201dOver the next hour, discussion turned first to how the jellylike substance might be internally reinforced and then to recent developments in 3D-printing technology, the odors emitted from various strains of bacteria and a \u201cguy next door\u201d who has engineered every color of yeast. Yi worried that the research and development stage would drag on endlessly. \u201cI want to start experimenting,\u201d she said.\u201cWe work very similarly,\u201d Yi told me, comparing artists to scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we work almost in reverse timelines: Scientists have their hypothesis and then spend the next 20 or 30 years of their career trying to prove it, whereas artists won\u2019t really understand what their hypothesis was until the end of their career.\u201dAs she left the lab, Yi said that she didn\u2019t yet know what the results of the day\u2019s work would be. \u201cThe work mutates,\u201d she said. \u201cIt mutates a lot.\u201dYI IS 45 AND, remarkably, has only been working as an artist for 10 years. But in that time she has had a surprisingly full career. Her Guggenheim exhibition is the result of winning the 2016 Hugo Boss Prize, an award that has previously gone to artists such as Tacita Dean and Paul Chan, and she\u2019ll also appear in this year\u2019s Whitney Biennial. She describes her sensibility as \u201ctechno-sensual,\u201d and her decade-old practice is both politically charged and emotionally motivated. She can be slyly autobiographical and far-ranging in the subjects of her critique, which include institutional sexism, our cultural obsession with cleanliness and the accepted power structures of the art world itself. Yi uses tools other artists of her generation would largely ignore, particularly science and scent. There are a few reference points for her work \u2014 the sensory assault of Matthew Barney, Robert Gober\u2019s eerie domesticity, Darren Bader\u2019s madcap ready-mades \u2014 but, for the most part, she is unlike anyone else.Yi\u2019s art provokes intense desire; one wants to touch it and smell it. Sometimes the wall text that hangs beside her work reads more like an alien shopping list than an informational label. Her materials include everything from aquarium gravel to Girl Scout cookies, and for various installations she has fermented kombucha into leather, tempura-fried flowers and injected live snails with oxytocin. One piece, from 2011, is made of, among other things, recalled powdered milk, antidepressants, palm tree essence, sea lice, a Teva sandal ground to dust and a cellphone signal jammer. In 2015, Yi invited 100 female friends and colleagues to swab their bodies in order to collect bacterial samples; a synthetic biologist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology then combined the samples, in effect creating \u201ca kind of fictional super-bacteria,\u201d as Yi put it, which she used as paint.Her art can be described literally in language, but the source of its power is harder to evoke. (\u201cIt\u2019s better experienced in person,\u201d said Katherine Brinson, who is curating Yi\u2019s Guggenheim show in late April. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s always the case, but with her it really is.\u201d) When Yi herself attempts to articulate her intention, she begins speaking in precise but broken fragments. From the beginning, she wanted to make work that \u201ccompletely charged all of [her] senses.\u201d Even in pieces that seem to focus on visual experience, Yi strives for full-body comprehension. A video she shot in the Amazon rain forest, for instance, was filmed in 3D; it will be shown next month at the Whitney Biennial.Often her work involves olfaction, which she sees as a kind of feminist intervention into an industry that privileges the gaze and its historically male connotations. \u201cSmell is the sense that\u2019s most closely associated with women, and I think it\u2019s a mistake to relegate it that way,\u201d she said. \u201cThat gendering reflects a long history of misogynist understanding about the mind and the body.\u201d For the same show in which she painted with bacteria, Yi recreated the scent of the Gagosian Gallery, an institution that she considers industry shorthand for blue-chip patriarchy. A 2015 show at Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland centered on \u201cthe scent of forgetting,\u201d a fragrance Yi created in collaboration with a French perfumer and whose design began by imagining the perspective of a fetus in an amniotic sac. The accompanying catalog \u2014 a reprinting of Yi\u2019s first monograph \u2014 was produced on incense paper infused with the scent. Visitors were encouraged to buy the book and then burn it after reading.YI WAS BORN in Korea and moved with her family to America when she was 2, first to Alabama and later to Southern California. Her father was a Protestant minister, her mother, who had a penchant for brand-name perfumes, worked for a biomedical corporation. She has three sisters and says there were \u201cferocious debates around fragrance\u201d in her family. It never occurred to her to go to art school. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to be an artist,\u201d she told me. \u201cI had a lot of anxieties around it; I felt like it was maybe an illegitimate pursuit.\u201d Despite the amount of hard science that goes into her work, Yi tends to describe her life in psychoanalytic terms: \u201cI think that when one has a petulant, antagonistic relationship to something, it\u2019s usually overcompensating through an insecure desire.\u201dShe spent her early 20s in London, freelancing haphazardly \u2014 writing advertising copy and styling fashion shoots. She felt badly about being so unsure of what she wanted to do. In 1996, she reluctantly moved to New York City, where she didn\u2019t know anyone. Through a few work projects \u2014 including one for the now-defunct cult magazine The Face \u2014 she became friends with a group of downtown fashion designers and artists, many of them members of the collective the Bernadette Corporation.And so, in her mid-30s, Yi began making art. Thankful for not having been \u201coverburdened by art-historical parameters,\u201d she describes her first attempts as purely visceral and productively na\u00efve. \u201cI was just gravitating toward textures,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t adhering to what was allowed and what was not allowed.\u201dShe was included in her first group exhibition in 2008, and in 2009 began showing at 179 Canal \u2014 now 47 Canal \u2014 a small but influential gallery run by two of her good friends, Margaret Lee and Oliver Newton. They gave Yi her first solo show in New York in 2011. Her rise since then has been swift and, in many ways, unique. Her work is anticommercial and often ephemeral. One major piece, featured as part of a trilogy of shows Yi mounted between 2013 and 2014 that dealt with a breakup that she described as a \u201cmetaphysically violent vivisection,\u201d featured an ice crystal that slowly melted over the course of the exhibition. The response to her work usually rests somewhere between perplexed and awe-struck. Elena Filipovic, the director of Kunsthalle Basel, first experienced Yi in 2011 at a group show in New York. She recalled walking into the space and being overcome by a curious installation and its unplaceable smell. \u201cWho has possibly made this strange combination of things?\u201d she thought to herself.A FEW WEEKS BEFORE I visited the lab, I met Yi for lunch at her home in Long Island City. She greeted me at the door in fur-lined slippers, bluejeans and a black cardigan embroidered elaborately with colorful birds. Like much of her work, the sweater was odd and particular, something that might transfix a young child.Her apartment, with its hardwood floors, high ceilings and cake-icing-like crown molding, is similarly bewitching. It is flooded with light and filled with plants; there are printouts of petri dishes taped to a wall \u2014 studies for a work in progress \u2014 but otherwise there is little evidence of the messiness that one expects from art-making.Yi does a lot of her work here, usually in her office, at least when it doesn\u2019t involve foul-smelling substances. She grimaced when I asked about her studio, which is in Bushwick. \u201cI don\u2019t like going there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so ugly, you don\u2019t see anyone over 30, and everyone looks identical.\u201d She groaned about the communal toilet and the \u201chorrifying\u201d industrial noise. \u201cIf I spend too much time there, my quality of life just gets really, really low.\u201dWe met four months before the opening of her Guggenheim exhibition, and she was reluctant to talk about what would be in it. It was clear that her hesitation wasn\u2019t so much a performance of privacy or even a commitment to surprise as it was a genuine sense of unknowing. Whatever she told me would almost certainly be untrue within a week or two. She would likely be as surprised by the final work as I would be.\u201cAn artist has to be the perfect contradiction at all times,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be just insane enough to want to do something that is so punishing and so difficult. But at the same time it takes a very sane person to execute it all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside Uber\u2019s Aggressive, Unrestrained Workplace Culture", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When new employees join Uber, they are asked to subscribe to 14 core company values, including making bold bets, being \u201cobsessed\u201d with the customer, and \u201calways be hustlin\u2019.\u201d The ride-hailing service particularly emphasizes \u201cmeritocracy,\u201d the idea that the best and brightest will rise to the top based on their efforts, even if it means stepping on toes to get there.Yet the focus on pushing for the best result has also fueled what current and former Uber employees describe as a Hobbesian environment at the company, in which workers are sometimes pitted against one another and where a blind eye is turned to infractions from top performers.Interviews with more than 30 current and former Uber employees, as well as reviews of internal emails, chat logs and tape-recorded meetings, paint a picture of an often unrestrained workplace culture. Among the most egregious accusations from employees, who either witnessed or were subject to incidents and who asked to remain anonymous because of confidentiality agreements and fear of retaliation: One Uber manager groped female co-workers\u2019 breasts at a company retreat in Las Vegas. A director shouted a homophobic slur at a subordinate during a heated confrontation in a meeting. Another manager threatened to beat an underperforming employee\u2019s head in with a baseball bat.\u201cIt seemed like every manager was fighting their peers and attempting to undermine their direct supervisor so that they could have their direct supervisor\u2019s job,\u201d Ms. Fowler wrote. \u201cNo attempts were made by these managers to hide what they were doing: They boasted about it in meetings, told their direct reports about it, and the like.\u201dTo contain the fallout, Mr. Kalanick also began more disclosure. On Monday, he said that 15.1 percent of Uber\u2019s engineering, product management and scientist roles were filled by women, and that those numbers had not changed substantively over the past year.In what was described by five attendees as an emotional moment, and according to a video of the meeting reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Kalanick apologized to employees for leading the company and the culture to this point. \u201cWhat I can promise you is that I will get better every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that I am authentically and fully dedicated to getting to the bottom of this.\u201dBelow is the full text of an internal memo sent to Uber employees this week by the company's chief, Travis Kalanick.That tone has been echoed in Uber\u2019s workplace. At least two former Uber workers said they had notified Thuan Pham, the company\u2019s chief technical officer, of workplace harassment at the hands of managers and colleagues in 2016. One also emailed Mr. Kalanick.Uber also faces at least three lawsuits in at least two countries from former employees alleging sexual harassment or verbal abuse at the hands of managers, according to legal documents reviewed by The Times. Other current and former employees said they were considering legal action against the company.Liane Hornsey, Uber\u2019s chief human resources officer, said in a statement, \u201cWe are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone.\u201dTo grow quickly, Uber kept its structure decentralized, emphasizing autonomy among regional offices. General managers are encouraged to \u201cbe themselves,\u201d another of Uber\u2019s core values, and are empowered to make decisions without intense supervision from the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. The top priority: Achieve growth and revenue targets.While Uber is now the dominant ride-hailing company in the United States, and is rapidly growing in South America, India and other countries, its explosive growth has come at a cost internally. As Uber hired more employees, its internal politics became more convoluted. Getting ahead, employees said, often involved undermining departmental leaders or colleagues.Workers like Ms. Fowler who went to human resources with their problems said they were often left stranded. She and a half-dozen others said human resources often made excuses for top performers because of their ability to improve the health of the business. Occasionally, problematic managers who were the subject of numerous complaints were shuffled around different regions; firings were less common.One group appeared immune to internal scrutiny, the current and former employees said. Members of the group, called the A-Team and composed of executives who were personally close to Mr. Kalanick, were shielded from much accountability over their actions.Uber\u2019s aggressive workplace culture spilled out at a global all-hands meeting in late 2015 in Las Vegas, where the company hired Beyonc\u00e9 to perform at the rooftop bar of the Palms Hotel. Between bouts of drinking and gambling, Uber employees used cocaine in the bathrooms at private parties, said three attendees, and a manager groped several female employees. (The manager was terminated within 12 hours.) One employee hijacked a private shuttle bus, filled it with friends and took it for a joy ride, the attendees said.At the Las Vegas outing, Mr. Kalanick also held a companywide lecture reviewing Uber\u2019s 14 core values, the attendees said. During the lecture, Mr. Kalanick pulled onstage employees who he believed exemplified each of the values. One of those was Mr. Michael.Since Ms. Fowler\u2019s blog post, several Uber employees have said they are considering leaving the company. Some are waiting until their equity compensation from Uber, which is restricted stock units, is vested. Others said they had started sending r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to competitors.Still other employees said they were hopeful that Uber could change. Mr. Kalanick has promised to deliver a diversity report to better detail the number of women and minorities who work at Uber, and the company is holding listening sessions with employees.At the Tuesday all-hands meeting, Ms. Huffington, the Uber board member, also vowed that the company would make another change. According to attendees and video of the meeting, Ms. Huffington said there would no longer be hiring of \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But there is much that is still unclear about his administration\u2019s attitudes toward science.Few scientists have gone as far as Dr. Eisen, but other researchers are now undergoing a political awakening, contemplating what their role should be for at least the next few years.But an activist role is not an easy fit for many scientists.\u201cRight now it\u2019s mostly talking about what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re scientists \u2014 we tend to plan very carefully what we do and then we try to do it well. But certainly there\u2019s an elevated sense that this is very real.\u201dThat sense has motivated hundreds of student and faculty volunteers at nearly a dozen universities to participate in \u201cdata rescue\u201d events over the last two months, the most recent of which was held this weekend at New York University. After a brief training session, participants spent six hours archiving environmental data from government websites, including those of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department.Much of the concern among scientists has been centered on the E.P.A., which was a favorite target of Mr. Trump during the campaign. Comments by members of his transition team have led to speculation that the new administration would gut the agency\u2019s science staff.Although he said he was speaking only for himself, Myron Ebell, who headed the E.P.A. transition but left on Jan. 19, said in a recent interview that science within the agency had become too politicized.\u201cI\u2019m a great believer in science,\u201d Mr. Ebell said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not a great believer in politicized science.\u201dMany scientists would argue that it is climate deniers and others who are politicized. The question of whether scientists should take sides politically is an old one, with the widespread and long-held view among many researchers that they should be quiet and let their data speak for itself.Some scientists have objected to plans for the Washington march, arguing that the event will feed the view among many conservatives that scientists have a political agenda.But the idea that they should be above the fray has been slowly unraveling as researchers realize that their own aloofness may largely be to blame for public disregard for the evidence on issues like climate change or vaccine safety. And in the era of Trump, some say it could finally come completely apart.Youth is leading the way in rejecting the old view, Mr. Rosenberg said. \u201cEarly career scientists, younger scientists \u2014 that\u2019s not an answer for them,\u201d he said.Dr. Prescod-Weinstein said she was especially incensed by what she and others viewed as efforts by some science organizations to reach out to the Trump administration.\u201cWhat history has taught us is that collaboration doesn\u2019t work for science,\u201d Dr. Prescod-Weinstein said. \u201cWhen we work with extremist, racist, Islamophobic or nationalist governments, it doesn\u2019t work for science.\u201d\u201cPeople are now getting to the point where they are understanding that this is a guy in the White House who doesn\u2019t have a firm grasp on science policy at all,\u201d Dr. Lubell said. \u201cNow they are mobilizing. But there\u2019s absolutely no strategy.\u201dDr. Eisen, the Berkeley biologist, would seem to have slim chances of winning a race for the Senate, since it is sure to be joined by several prominent Democrats if Dianne Feinstein, the longtime incumbent, decides not to run.Like many academic scientists, Dr. Gill employs several graduate students in her laboratory and has received grant funds for research that is still in progress. But the idea of public service, at what she considers an urgent time for climate science, is tugging at her.\u201cI came into this career wanting to do science that\u2019s in the public good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd maybe now that means something different than it did before.\u201dAn earlier version of this article transposed two words in the name of an government agency. It is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, not the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration.John Schwartz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Quiet Giant of Investing Weighs In on Trump", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookHe is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of. His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $795 on Amazon, and a new copy sells for as much as $3,500.Perhaps that\u2019s why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump \u2014 and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry \u2014 has quietly become the most sought-after reading material on Wall Street.He is Seth A. Klarman, the 59-year-old value investor who runs Baupost Group, which manages some $30 billion.While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as \u201cThe Oracle of Boston,\u201d where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised.In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing \u201cperilously high valuations.\u201d\u201cExuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from America-first protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers,\u201d he wrote.\u201cPresident Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhile they might be popular, the reason the U.S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don\u2019t work, they actually leave society worse off.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of pro-growth policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump\u2019s stimulus efforts \u201ccould prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors.\u201dAnd he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy\u2019s growth over the long term.\u201cThe Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cThe large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today\u2019s artificially low levels.\u201dMuch of Mr. Klarman\u2019s anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership style. He described it this way: \u201cThe erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound decision-making.\u201dHe also linked this point \u2014 which is a fair one \u2014 to what \u201cTrump style\u201d means for Mr. Klarman\u2019s constituency and others.\u201cThe big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he\u2019s apparently deliberately so; he says it\u2019s part of his plan.\u201dWhile Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, \u201cIf things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst.\u201dMr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner.While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: \u201cHis words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president.\u201dIn his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. \u201cDespite my preference to stay out of the media,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander.\u201dFrom the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund\u2019s money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years.What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election \u2014 about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet \u2014 wrongly so far \u2014 that the stock market would fall; he lost about $1 billion.Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes \u2014 he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s index \u2014 he blamed the influx of money into the industry.\u201cWith any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cNo surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured.\u201dHe continued, \u201cTo many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product.\u201dThe lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity.Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes \u2014 at least that finance geeks will appreciate \u2014 is what he says is the irony that investors now \u201chave gotten excited about market-hugging index funds and exchange traded funds (E.T.F.s) that mimic various market or sector indices.\u201dHe says he sees big trouble ahead in this area \u2014 or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit.\u201cOne of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E.T.F. activity is that it will tend to \u2018lock in\u2019 today\u2019s relative valuations between securities,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote.\u201cWhen money flows into an index fund or index-related E.T.F., the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership),\u201d he wrote. \u201cThus today\u2019s high-multiple companies are likely to also be tomorrow\u2019s, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings.\u201dTo Mr. Klarman, \u201cstocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it.\u201d\u201cThis should give long-term value investors a distinct advantage,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become.\u201dHow Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here\u2019s a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: \u201cIn matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.\u201dThe DealBook column on Tuesday, about the investor Seth A. Klarman, referred incorrectly in some copies to a statement he issued criticizing Donald J. Trump last year. It was related to Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of a judge\u2019s Mexican heritage, not a recording in which Mr. Trump talked about groping women.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macy\u2019s Is Said to Receive Takeover Approach by Hudson\u2019s Bay", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Macy\u2019s of today grew from the union of several great names in American retailing, including its namesake chain, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Marshall Field\u2019s.But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further, combining with Macy\u2019s to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling. Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, the Canadian owner of Saks, has approached Macy\u2019s about a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday.Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale. While it is unclear whether a deal will happen, a combination could lift the fortunes of Macy\u2019s, the country\u2019s biggest department store, which has been struggling.Investors certainly appeared to see it that way. Shares of Macy\u2019s rose as much as 12 percent on Friday, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11, according to data from Bloomberg.Once a retail titan, Macy\u2019s has struggled to remain relevant as e-commerce and discount retailers have decimated the traditional brick-and-mortar business.Since the recession, shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price. Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished. Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices, which cuts into their margins.Departments stores have been hit especially hard, particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls. What has emerged, analysts say, is a virtual race to the bottom.That has been particularly difficult for Macy\u2019s, born of a series of mergers over the past two decades that made it a juggernaut in the industry. A stalwart of the middle tier of retail, the company has neither the advantages of low-cost retailers like H&M nor the highest-end stores.Macy\u2019s has taken some steps to sell or redevelop stores, and last year, it added an expert on real estate transactions to its board. But the company has largely resisted more ambitious efforts to divest its real estate, including so-called sale-leaseback deals, in which a company sells the underlying land beneath its stores and then rents it back.The company\u2019s suitor, Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, is far smaller \u2014 its market value was about 1.9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1.5 billion \u2014 but is known for its bold steps. Hudson\u2019s Bay Company has assembled a growing empire that includes the Hudson\u2019s Bay department store chain, Lord & Taylor and its crown jewel, Saks.Financing a bid for Macy\u2019s may be trickier, however, because the it carries about $6.5 billion in long-term debt. That may mean that the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company will have to bring in a partner or borrow against more of its real estate holdings.A representative for Starboard Value did not respond to a request for comment.Some analysts said that they saw the merit of a potential combination, particularly given Macy\u2019s operational woes and Mr. Baker\u2019s expertise in wringing money out of real estate.\u201cThere is a clear logic, despite disparity in size/market cap\u201d between Macy\u2019s and Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm, said in a note.Referring to Macy\u2019s stock ticker symbol, he added, \u201cThe retail market has been changing faster than M has been able to keep up with, whether the flight from the mall or the migration online.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Attorneys General Became Democrats\u2019 Bulwark Against Trump", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe three Democratic lawyers met over dinner in a cavernous hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., picking at seafood as they discussed how to take on President Trump: Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York; Josh Shapiro, his counterpart in Pennsylvania; and Xavier Becerra, a former congressman who had been sworn in as attorney general of California only a day earlier.Unrecognized so far from home, and little known to one another, the men spent a Wednesday evening late in January discussing a range of White House policies that might unsettle their states, including a mass deportation of unauthorized immigrants.They never anticipated that a live-fire test of their teamwork would come less than 48 hours later.In interviews, more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, governors and party operatives detailed a week of frenzied litigation, late-night and early-morning phone calls and text messages, and strategies devised on airplanes and at sporting events. All told, Democrats say, the legal onslaught against Mr. Trump was a crystallizing moment for the party\u2019s attorneys general \u2014 and a model for how to stall or unwind the administration policies they find most offensive.Mr. Schneiderman, a former state senator from Manhattan who is in his second term as attorney general, called the travel ban a \u201cfirst test\u201d of the Democratic legal apparatus under Mr. Trump.\u201cIf they follow through on campaign promises as outrageous as a Muslim ban, then we do have a serious challenge to our constitutional structure,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.The immigration order spurred swift legal actions from five states in four federal courts, and for the most part they adopted a common strategy. With the attorneys general and their aides frequently trading notes, three states \u2014 New York, Massachusetts and Virginia \u2014 intervened on behalf of individuals stopped at airports. All three cited the state\u2019s interest in protecting students and faculty members at public universities.The matter is likely to end up before the Supreme Court.The number of states opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s order in court may continue to grow: On Monday, Attorney General Doug Chin of Hawaii filed a motion to join Mr. Ferguson\u2019s suit. And 16 of Mr. Ferguson\u2019s colleagues \u2014 including Mr. Schneiderman, Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Becerra \u2014 filed an amicus brief with the appeals court supporting his action.Hector Balderas, the New Mexico attorney general, said he had directed aides to identify areas where Trump administration policies could damage New Mexico.He described the attack on Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order as a blueprint for state attorneys general who aim to rein in the White House.\u201cIt does seem that we are becoming, potentially, the fourth branch of government,\u201d Mr. Balderas said in an interview.Several state attorneys general have cited as an inspiration the long-running legal war waged against the Obama administration by Republican attorneys general, who derailed key White House policies on immigration and nearly voided the Affordable Care Act.While Mr. Trump was being sworn in last month, three up-and-coming Democratic attorneys general \u2014 Mr. Balderas, Mr. Schneiderman and Maura Healey of Massachusetts \u2014 joined a conference of wealthy political donors in South Florida to deliberate over the party\u2019s future. Ms. Healey said there appeared to be an \u201cawakening\u201d among Democratic leaders about the significance of party leaders in the states.Chris Jankowski, a Republican strategist who was an architect of his party\u2019s efforts to elect formidable attorneys general over the past decade, said Democratic attorneys general were \u201cclearly poised to emerge as a check on the Trump administration, just as their Republican colleagues did for eight years.\u201dMr. Jankowski, a lawyer, said Democratic attorneys general would probably rely heavily on the Constitution\u2019s civil rights protections, much as Republicans leaned on constitutional limits on federal economic power.\u201cState attorneys general are now permanent pieces on the chessboard of national policy development and implementation,\u201d Mr. Jankowski said. \u201cAnd they are not mere pawns.\u201dOn the last Friday in January, many of those officials had gathered in Fort Lauderdale for a conference of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, a group that helps raise money for their campaigns.Normally a combination of dry panel discussions and partisan strategizing, the event had a distinctly ominous tone in the shadow of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, several attendees said: At a private luncheon, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former Democratic Party chairwoman, exhorted the group to see itself as a last line of defense.Ms. Wasserman Schultz, in an interview, said she asked the attorneys general to work with congressional Democrats to combat \u201can administration that has no regard for the law or the Constitution.\u201dThe White House issued its immigration decree the same day.For the Democrats gathered in Fort Lauderdale, the order was like a starter\u2019s pistol. Racing back to their home states, they began a loosely coordinated effort to challenge Mr. Trump in court.If some of his colleagues were caught off guard, Mr. Ferguson, a cerebral former state chess champion, said his office had been bracing for just such an action. \u201cWe\u2019d been anticipating that the president would execute an executive order along these lines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d been having internal communications about it.\u201dMr. Ferguson told his staff that he viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s policy as thoroughly unconstitutional. An effective lawsuit, he said, should leave the order in tatters.His colleagues across the country, however, quickly settled on a narrower legal strategy: In New York and Massachusetts, Mr. Schneiderman and Ms. Healey developed plans to assail the Trump order based on its impact on specific state institutions, like public hospitals and universities where faculty members and students would be affected.Ms. Healey, a former Harvard basketball player, said she and her senior aides spoke with top officials at the University of Massachusetts, M.I.T. and her alma mater as they developed their suit. In a bipartisan gesture, she also resolved to bring her state\u2019s Republican governor, Charlie Baker, on board. The two spoke before the suit was filed, Ms. Healey said, and Mr. Baker issued a statement backing the challenge.Though many national Republicans declined to criticize Mr. Trump, Ms. Healey said the image of solidarity across party lines had been important in her state. \u201cThis goes to the heart of who we are,\u201d she said.In the suburbs of Philadelphia on the same Saturday, Mr. Shapiro, a former county commissioner sworn in as attorney general just 11 days earlier, began rounding up counterparts to issue a joint statement of opposition to the executive order while he was coaching his 7-year-old son\u2019s basketball game.Tapping away on his iPhone, Mr. Shapiro circulated a draft to colleagues including Mr. Schneiderman, Mr. Becerra and Ms. Healey before appealing to the full group of Democratic attorneys general to endorse it. Democratic legal officers from 16 states and the District of Columbia signed the letter; attorneys general from six states, including deep-red Mississippi and Kentucky, did not.In the statement, the signers pledged to \u201cuse all the tools of our offices to fight this unconstitutional order and preserve our nation\u2019s national security and core values.\u201d Mr. Shapiro said he \u201cpersonally worked the phones\u201d to organize the group message.But Mr. Ferguson filed the first and broadest state lawsuit on Monday, Jan. 30, with a far more sweeping complaint depicting the executive order as an unlawful assault on Washington businesses and communities.Each day brought new legal actions by the states: On Tuesday, Ms. Healey announced that Massachusetts would join a lawsuit backed by the A.C.L.U. involving plaintiffs flying through Logan International Airport in Boston. Mr. Schneiderman announced a similar approach in New York. Throughout the week, Attorney General Mark R. Herring of Virginia filed a flurry of legal actions aimed at bolstering the claims of people detained at Dulles International Airport, and challenging the conduct of federal immigration officers there.Yet rather than demonstrating weakness, the diffuse nature of the Democratic legal response ended up working to the state attorneys general\u2019s advantage, effectively allowing Mr. Trump\u2019s foes to test multiple strategies before multiple federal judges.And when the anti-Trump lawyers faced one setback in court on Friday, as a federal judge in Boston declined to extend a decision suspending parts of the travel ban, that disappointment was quickly overshadowed by Mr. Ferguson\u2019s victory in Seattle.\u201cAll of us cheered,\u201d Ms. Healey said, recalling the news of the ruling.Some did more than cheer: One group, including Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Schneiderman and Ms. Healey, marshaled support for a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief supporting Mr. Ferguson as he heads into protracted litigation.\u201cWhat is our country coming to,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhen a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Opposition to Trump Propelled by Employees, Not Executives", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late September, a group of tech leaders started a well-publicized effort to raise $100,000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324.For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent.No longer.Nearly 100 technology companies said that President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries would violate both immigration law and the United States Constitution.\u201cSilicon Valley is stepping up,\u201d said Sam Altman, who runs the valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, Y Combinator. \u201cThe companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don\u2019t support.\u201dIt is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable \u2014 not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.\u201cPeople voted with their feet, and Travis listened,\u201d said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. \u201cWe need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.\u201dResistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a voice with the president if you didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.\u201dWhen President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, he upended the fates of people who had waited for years to get into the U.S. Here are portraits of those affected by the ban.Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,\u201d said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey all have the same leanings.\u201dMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google\u2019s former slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is the most forceful expression of this.\u201cIf you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,\u201d Mr. Shotts said.Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards,\u201d and saying it would create \u201cmuch collateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dThe immigration battle is in Microsoft\u2019s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\u201cIn 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,\u201d said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. \u201cThe most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.\u201dMr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous \u201cfor the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren\u2019t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can\u2019t fix the monetization of fake news.\u201dPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.\u201cI\u2019ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,\u201d said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.He talked about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which asks women, \u201cWhat would you do if you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201d Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women\u2019s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.\u201cWe have to protest in public,\u201d he said. The event raised $30,000 for the legal aid groups.\u201cIt looked like two-thirds of the room were newcomers,\u201d Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement.\u201cI want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re pushing at least as hard as Trump is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ecuador Votes as Latin America\u2019s Left Sags, a Generation of Icons Gone", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQUITO, Ecuador \u2014 For most of Luis Garc\u00eda\u2019s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of this tiny Andean country: Rafael Correa, the leftist leader of Ecuador\u2019s so-called citizens\u2019 revolution.But when Mr. Garc\u00eda went to the polls Sunday, Mr. Correa was not on the ballot. Unsatisfied with the options that remained, Mr. Garc\u00eda, a 33-year-old musician who first voted for Mr. Correa in 2006, chose to simply scribble over his ballot, rendering it invalid.\u201cI don\u2019t feel represented now,\u201d he said.That feeling of malaise among the left has been spreading throughout Latin America as, one by one, a generation of iconic leaders has departed the stage, brought down by death, elections, impeachment or, in Mr. Correa\u2019s case, term limits. They were known by many names, including the New Left, and ruled the length of the continent with big promises and bigger personalities.Picking up the mantle of the revolutions for which the region became famous in the 1960s and 1970s, these leaders expanded education, increased subsidies for the poor and built roads, highways and hospitals. But they often ran roughshod over those who tried to check their power, from judges to international lenders.And now, nearly all are gone.\u201cThese are not isolated events; it is a great reversal,\u201d said Gabriela Rivadeneira, the president of Ecuador\u2019s National Assembly, controlled by Mr. Correa\u2019s Alianza Pa\u00eds party, which for years rubber-stamped his reforms with few questions asked. \u201cWe are now the place that the region is looking at for what comes next.\u201dMr. Correa was a larger-than-life and often contradictory figure, an American-educated economist who regularly flipped between the mold of a fiery populist and the pragmatism of a studied technocrat.By most accounts, poverty and inequality decreased in Ecuador as Mr. Correa funneled oil revenue into everything from raising the salaries of teachers to rebuilding the country\u2019s highways and expanding clinics into the Amazon region. It helped that the price of oil was more than $100 per barrel for some of his tenure. Wealth flowed into the capital, Quito, whose streets bustle with new cars and S.U.V.s as workers dig a vast new metro system below.But whether Ecuador\u2019s leftist agenda will continue when Mr. Correa leaves office is unclear. There is the question of oil revenue, for one.As in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, the social programs in Ecuador that lifted millions out of poverty were underwritten by a commodities boom that sputtered out years ago. Government revenue, around $25 billion a year when oil prices spiked, has now shrunk to less than half that, $11 billion, mainly because of the declining price of oil.That has left the country heavily indebted to China. Ecuador\u2019s economy ground to a halt last year after growing, on average, 4 percent or more from 2006 to 2014.\u201cThe model has reached its end because the money has run out,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Robalino, a conservative banker at the Pichincha College of Economists in Quito.Mr. Robalino said Ecuador\u2019s next president, regardless of political affiliation, would need to take a tougher line on spending, reduce the number of government workers and cut subsidies like the ones used to reduce gas prices for all Ecuadoreans.That is the stance championed by the conservative opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso, a wealthy banker from Mr. Correa\u2019s hometown, Guayaquil, who finished second in the last election against him in 2013. Mr. Lasso is promising to roll back public spending while eliminating more than a dozen taxes, which would mean the loss of billions of dollars from state coffers.\u201cWhat a government should do is facilitate entrepreneurship,\u201d Mr. Lasso said in a TV interview during the campaign, adding that he thought Mr. Correa generated too much employment through public-sector jobs.Lenin Moreno, the leading left-wing candidate, has promised to do more with less, borrowing when necessary. In a response to written questions, Mr. Moreno said that despite the collapse of oil prices, Mr. Correa had avoided cutting social programs and gas subsidies used by the poor. Mr. Moreno said he would continue that policy if the left won.With about 80 percent of ballots counted on Sunday night, Mr. Moreno, 63, a former deputy of Mr. Correa, was leading with 38.8 percent, just more than a point short of the threshold needed to avoid a second round in April. Analysts said that if the numbers held, they would create an opening for Mr. Lasso, who was in second place, to unite his and the remaining opposition votes and potentially capture the presidency.If Mr. Moreno wins, he will face the challenge of setting himself apart from his predecessor and his legacy. Mr. Correa has said he will move to Belgium after his term ends, but some argue that if the left remains in power, Mr. Correa will try to influence politics from behind the scenes.\u201c\u2018I command, I direct,\u2019 is how he thinks,\u201d said Jorge Le\u00f3n, a political scientist at the Central University of Ecuador.Mr. Le\u00f3n pointed to an authoritarian streak in Mr. Correa that also became a hallmark of leftists in several other South American countries. After changing the Constitution \u2014 a move that allowed him to be re-elected twice \u2014 the president proposed allowing himself to run for a fourth time. (He backtracked when it became clear that popular opinion was against him.)Mr. Correa also tried to make life difficult for his critics during his time in office. He sued journalists, toughened defamation laws and even took over TV channels whose owners criticized him. More recently, he tried to close an environmental group that was stirring up opposition to a planned copper mine in the Amazon.It will be up to Mr. Correa\u2019s successor to decide whether to build on his legacy or reverse it. But those who have tried to forge a different path in the region have faced troubles.President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, despite his vow to revive the country\u2019s economy with market-oriented policies, has had trouble attracting investment to his country, noted Franklin Ram\u00edrez, a professor at the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Quito. Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, has been dogged by corruption allegations similar to those that brought down leftists.\u201cIt\u2019s a little early to speak of the end of a cycle here\u201d for the left, Mr. Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cThe hegemony of the left has ended,\u201d he said, but added that it was not clear what would replace it.Advertisement"}

He\u2019d search out immensely popular, award-winning foreign shows and track down their creators and producers.\u201cIt was a cultural crime that all these beautiful pieces made around the world didn\u2019t have a home,\u201d Mr. Iuzzolino said. \u201cI thought: I want to become that home.

{"Headline": "Men\u2019s Runways Are Threaded With Dissent", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's Notebook\u201cAn idea is a good thing,\u201d Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, said on Tuesday, as he bolted in his biker jacket and skinny jeans from one show to another. \u201cBut a theme can scare me running away.\u201dDespite everyone\u2019s best efforts to shut out the world beyond New York Fashion Week: Men\u2019s, a unifying theme emerged: the parlous state of current politics.It didn\u2019t matter that the visitors to the Skylight Clarkson North event space in Lower Manhattan, where most of the shows were held, tried to drink away their worries at the cozy VIP Amazon Lounge; or escaped into chatter about Alejandro G\u00f3mez Palomo, a young Spanish designer who shocked the front row with a show featuring men in frilly frocks; or talked about the head of Ralph Lauren being unceremoniously shoved into the oubliette.Of the dozens of designers interviewed during a four-day marathon that ended on Thursday, not one failed to volunteer some expression of concern, anxiety, perplexity or stark anger about the barrage of executive orders, tweets and statements recently issued from the White House.40 Photos\u201cPeople are in disbelief,\u201d Mr. Varvatos said. \u201cHalf the people in my company are from someplace else.\u201dSo, it would seem, are half the personnel in the industry. Consider the major designers anchoring a men\u2019s wear fashion week now in its fourth iteration and gaining strength in terms of its offerings and the breadth of representation.Mr. Varvatos, for example, is a second-generation American whose parents migrated from Greece and settled in Detroit. The Bronx-born Ralph Lauren is the son of Askhenazi Jewish immigrants from Belarus. Raised in South Boston, Joseph Abboud was born in the United States to Maronite Christian parents who, seeking greater opportunity, fled Lebanon for America.40 Photos34 Photos\u201cThe political moment is hard,\u201d Mr. Chavarria said, over the bass-heavy din of recorded hip-hop at his presentation. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a call to action for a generation that maybe got a little lazy. It\u2019s up to us now to be harder ourselves \u2014 to love harder, to fight harder, to come hard with our ideas.\u201dIdeas, as Mr. Downing said, are good things. And, as it happened, the week was rife with them. There were Mr. Chavarria\u2019s supersize denim trousers, his bathrobe-style coats of fur or washable alpaca, his knit caps discreetly embroidered with a rebuke to hate speech too coarse to be printed here and his athletic sweatshirts emblazoned with the timely: \u201cGender Bender Super Bawl Champions.\u201dThere were Mr. Simons\u2019s innovative, oversize intarsia sweaters, developed in collaboration with the Woolmark Company, featuring hems that rode up at the back, kangaroo pockets on the chest and, in some cases, a vaguely ambivalent interpretation of Milton Glaser\u2019s \u201cI \u2665 NY\u201d logo.There was a Ralph Lauren Purple Label collection that gave scant indication that his company is in the midst of what one analyst called \u201cbrand confusion.\u201d Seldom bested as a conjurer of narrative fantasy during the half-century he has been in business, Mr. Lauren made it clear that his Gatsbyesque vision still has legs. Here he reimagined a young man of wealth as having humor enough to leave the house wearing a black satin dinner jacket whose subtle jacquard pattern depicts cowboys riding bucking broncos \u2014 an image copied from a vintage sleeping bag \u2014 and confident enough in his taste to wear a shawl-collared suit of evening clothes in chocolate corduroy.Mr. Dolan\u2019s affection for functional work wear, which he reconfigures in Brobdingnagian proportions, is only half the equation, he said. \u201cMy mom was a big quilter, and that\u2019s been a big influence on me,\u201d he said.The primary idea driving Mr. Varvatos\u2019s latest collection, he said before his show, involved his conviction that millennial men now discovering the suit want something that keeps them from resembling their fathers. \u201cThey want to push out the boundaries,\u201d Mr. Varvatos said. He does, too.With his fall 2017 collection, the designer stuck to a restrained narrow silhouette for taut frock coats, biker jackets, barn coats and 10-button Edwardian-style jackets. And he confined his experiments to fabrication. Despite the best efforts of moral philosophers like Peter Singer, fur has been steadily making a comeback.37 PhotosThe best designs at the Varvatos show were for things like a lynx print calfskin biker jacket that would make anyone want to become rock star; or a flimsy topcoat lined with cropped shearling \u2014 just the sort of stuff to give PETA conniptions.It included trousers, that is, and a few items you might term suits. True, they came in purple satin brocade with chest-baring portrait collars; or gold lam\u00e9 with flounces and neck frills; or constituted little more than a white satin bustier worn with thigh boots and a pair of Y-front briefs.Of all the many design ideas on display during New York Fashion Week: Men\u2019s, Mr. Palomo\u2019s were by miles the most fantastical and giddy. Yet, as the men\u2019s wear industry has been trudging steadily away from gender fluidity and toward masculinity as historically constituted, the sight of a guy kitted out in Cuban heels, a garter belt, a pair of shiny culottes or a flounced figure-skating costume seemed less outrageous than, perhaps, pass\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nikki Haskell Learns the Social Cost of Supporting Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocietyNikki Haskell has packed many lives into her 75 years. She has been a real estate broker, a party planner, a pioneering stockbroker, a cult talk-show host, a Studio 54 regular, a diet and fitness guru, and a socialite. Through it all, she has depended on her brains, her enthusiasm and her skill as a social connector to power her through the tough times.But now she is facing what may be the most difficult challenge of her life: maintaining her position in the social hierarchies of liberal New York and Los Angeles while serving as a cheerleader for one of her oldest friends, Donald J. Trump, whom she first encountered in 1974 at Le Club, a defunct members-only nightspot on East 55th Street in Manhattan.Ms. Haskell said she had a wonderful time at the black-tie, pre-inauguration dinner held for Mr. Trump at Union Station in Washington on Jan. 19. But over the weekend, in a three-bedroom suite at the Mandarin Oriental, she seemed to be wavering a little.\u201cYou see what\u2019s going on in the streets, all these people rioting, all these women?\u201d she said in a phone conversation. \u201cNothing ever happened like this. They never had these riots \u2014 every street, every city, all across the world. When there\u2019s crowds and craziness like this, you never know what\u2019ll happen. It\u2019s horrifying.\u201dGiven what she was seeing on television and in her social media feeds, she was worried that her vocal support for the new president would make her a pariah.\u201cI can\u2019t be the only person in the whole world defending Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be walking down the street, they\u2019ll attack me. I don\u2019t want to be attacked. This is totally out of control. I\u2019m afraid to walk down the streets in New York or L.A. I\u2019m trying to get a television show on the air, which will never happen in this environment. I\u2019ll never have another friend. Nobody\u2019s going to speak to me.\u201dWhen Ms. Haskell was a girl growing up on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, her father bought her six horses, and she wore custom riding suits, with white wing collars and high silk hats, in shows across the Midwest. At night, her parents took her to the Chicago nightclub Chez Paris, where she became besotted with show business while taking in performances by Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante, Carmen Miranda and Mae West.Not long after the family moved to Beverly Hills, Calif., when Ms. Haskell was 13, her father died of a heart attack and her mother went to work. Ms. Haskell soldiered on. At Beverly Hills High School, she was head cheerleader and was voted \u201cBiggest Flirt\u201d in her senior year.In the Los Angeles of the 1960s, she won a twist contest judged by Bob Hope and Joan Collins. She dated Tony Bennett and hung out with Frankie Avalon, Fabian and George Hamilton.She married a real estate developer, Jack Haskell. After divorcing him, she said, she parlayed the $18,000 settlement into a small fortune on the stock market.She remarried Mr. Haskell in 1966, moved with him to 470 Park Avenue in New York and divorced him again in 1968. She got her apartment in Manhattan, took classes in investing and was hired at Burnham and Company (which would later become Drexel Burnham).For 10 years, she was a stockbroker by day (and one of the few women working on Wall Street) and a constant presence at Manhattan restaurants and clubs by night. She was equally at ease dining at Elaine\u2019s or judging a Blueboy magazine beauty pageant in the meatpacking district. She joked that she lived at Studio 54. She made friends with Rick James, Imelda Marcos, Andy Warhol and the Village People.She hit her stride with \u201cThe Nikki Haskell Show,\u201d a charmingly low-budget program on the New York public-access stations Channel J and Channel 10. In the 1980s, she was the forerunner of a YouTube star, and her guests included Michael Caine, Divine, Timothy Leary, Sophia Loren, Diana Ross, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Sellers and Peter Ustinov. And Mr. Trump.New York magazine called her the \u201cQueen of Comp\u201d for her habit of scoring freebies in exchange for positive publicity. Spy magazine, less charmed by her social climbing, likened her to Pia Zadora.A longtime Democrat, she faced a dilemma last year when Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination began to take off.\u201cI\u2019m sort of in a quandary,\u201d she said in her Upper East Side apartment last April, \u201cbecause nothing would make me happier in the whole world than to see Hillary Clinton as president. I never thought that in my lifetime we would have a woman president, and I\u2019ve always been very supportive of the Clintons. I\u2019m a registered Democrat, but I vote across party lines and would never have voted for anyone else except for Hillary, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Donald\u2019s running.\u201dOne reason she was leaning toward Mr. Trump was her belief that people were not ready for a female president. \u201cThe way things are throughout the world, men just don\u2019t respect women enough,\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cAt this time a president being a woman might be detrimental. I hate to say that, but we live in a very, very antiwoman society.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s when it all started,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a disaster.\u201dOn election night, she went to a dinner in New York hosted by an entertainment mogul and was the only person there who admitted to voting for Mr. Trump, she said. Around 3 a.m., Ms. Haskell logged on to Facebook and posted: \u201cHow great, America wins. We love President Donald J. Trump.\u201d\u201cYou must be senile,\u201d one of her followers replied.\u201cU ought to be ashamed,\u201d another wrote.On Nov. 10, she made a selfie video in the back of a New York City taxi and posted it on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to do our part to make America great,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or not, now is the time to become a better America.\u201d Before signing off with her customary goodbye (\u201ctoodle-oo!\u201d), she reminded everyone to watch her old public access shows \u2014 now available on Amazon Prime \u2014 a few of which showed her interviewing Mr. Trump when he was a mogul on the rise.Friends distanced themselves from Ms. Haskell, she said, and one bestie dropped her after 25 years of friendship. \u201cI was actually in tears when someone told me they didn\u2019t want to be my friend anymore because I supported Donald Trump,\u201d she said.But Ms. Haskell refused to stop cheerleading. She made another video of herself while riding in a car down Park Avenue during the time of the frequent demonstrations near Trump Tower and the Trump International Hotel and Tower on Columbus Circle.After expressing frustration with the marches and protests (\u201cstupid,\u201d she called them), she said into her iPhone: \u201cDonald Trump is not going away, and people are going to have to smack their kids around and sit them down and tell them to stop acting like jerks. And to be Americans and get with the program. See you later. Toodle-oo!\u201dIn December, the writer Kevin Sessums was fed up with her pro-Trump posts on Facebook. The last straw was Ms. Haskell\u2019s posting her 1982 public access interview with Roy Cohn, the mentor to Mr. Trump who served as Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s counsel during the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954.\u201cAs if that were a glamorous, wonderful bit of footage,\u201d Mr. Sessums posted.A later thread taking aim at Ms. Haskell grew to more than 100 comments.Over the holidays, she visited the California home of the movie producer Robert Evans, who wrote about Ms. Haskell in his 2013 memoir, \u201cThe Fat Lady Sang.\u201d He said he had no sympathy for those who have dropped her because of her support for the president. \u201cI love her for it,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cBy losing Nikki\u2019s friendship, they\u2019re the losers. But she is a winner.\u201dOn the afternoon of Jan. 19 at the Mandarin Oriental suite, which she was sharing with her friend, the fund-raiser and philanthropist Kelly Day, Ms. Haskell started getting ready for the black-tie dinner at Union Station for Mr. Trump\u2019s donors and family members.\u201cDonald always had big ideas, big dreams, and I was always fascinated with that,\u201d she said while doing her eyelashes.She recalled first seeing him at Le Club. \u201cHe was really handsome, a hot guy, and he caught my eye immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very captivating, even in a discoth\u00e8que at night.\u201d Several months later, Mr. Cohn invited her to dinner at \u201c21\u201d and seated her next to Mr. Trump. \u201cWe clicked right away,\u201d she said.The first night he took a Czech fashion model named Ivana Zelnickova out on the town, Ms. Haskell, along with her date, met up with them at Elaine\u2019s. \u201cIvana and I became friends like that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when Studio 54 opened in 1977, I went with Donald and Ivana.\u201dAs Ms Haskell and Ms. Day left the suite, Ms. Haskell spoke of her increasing number of ex-friends. \u201cIt takes a lot to make me cry,\u201d she said, putting on a golden sable coat. \u201cI have no children. I have a fabulous brother, nieces and nephews, but I\u2019m a woman alone of 75 years old, and I find it just so disheartening.\u201dAt Union Station, once through the metal detectors, Ms. Haskell smiled for the paparazzi. Her table was next to those occupied by Trump family members. After a speech by the president-elect, Ms. Haskell chatted a while with Melania, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump.\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here,\u201d Tiffany told her.As waiters cleared away the main course (roasted branzino), she got up. \u201cI supported Donald when no one supported him,\u201d Ms. Haskell said on her way to the powder room. \u201cOne of the family just said to me, \u2018It wouldn\u2019t have happened if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessarily true. But I really believe in Donald.\u201dShe walked by Jose Fanjul, the sugar baron, and Christine Hearst Schwarzman, the wife of the billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman. \u201cYou know why it\u2019s a great party?\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cBecause everybody here loves Donald.\u201dAfter dessert (vanilla meringue cake), she seemed to feel better about those ex-friends of hers. \u201cThey\u2019ll get over it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t.\u201dA protester was scowling at guests leaving the party. \u201cHe makes America ashamed!\u201d the woman said.\u201cListen, Donald has more respect for women than anyone I know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not a guy. Guys talk about girls. They talk about getting them into bed. But it\u2019s just guy talk.\u201d She remembered the interviews she did with him. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re all on Amazon Prime,\u201d she said. \u201cThe history of what I\u2019ve done will live on forever.\u201dBack in the suite, Ms. Haskell and Ms. Day ordered room service and didn\u2019t call it quits until around 4:30 a.m. Later, they watched the inauguration together in their bathrobes. On Sunday, while watching the women\u2019s protests on television, Ms. Haskell said she might ease up on the cheerleading until things settled down. \u201cI\u2019m just one little person,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not Kellyanne Conway.\u201dShe got dressed and made it to Reagan National Airport. \u201cI\u2019m never going to march,\u201d she said on the phone, after clearing through security. \u201cYes, it worked in the Vietnam War and things like that, but that was a different time. I would have no problem going to Congress, and because I have this close friendship with the Trump family, I will use this opportunity to better all the things for women. Because that\u2019s exactly how I feel.\u201dWhile still counting herself a Trump supporter, Ms. Haskell has indeed eased up with the Facebook posts in favor of the president since the inauguration weekend.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m running out of friends and I got tired of all the negativity,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cPeople were busting my chops and I lost a couple of very close friends, which I think is actually quite insane and pathetic, to think that people who are these lifelong friends are not speaking to me because I voted for Donald Trump.\u201dBut lately she has taken pains to post nonincendiary material. \u201cJust to show you how things have changed,\u201d Ms. Haskell said, \u201cthe other day I posted myself going to the grocery store. That was a first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Here Is How to Fend Off a Hijacking of Home Devices", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixMODERN homes today are getting internet-connected light bulbs, thermostats, TVs and speakers. So with a simple voice command or the touch of a button on our smartphones, we can set the temperature, turn on a light or prepare the TV to record a program.What could go wrong?As smart home devices become more popular, they will become bigger targets for hackers. So it behooves us to get ahead of the curve by securing our home appliances, using these tips from security experts who have closely studied smart home accessories.When shopping for an internet-connected home device like a smart speaker, lighting system or television set, a good rule of thumb is to go with a trusted brand.People should also carefully read company privacy policies. David Britton, a vice president in the fraud and identity department of Experian, the credit reporting agency, said people should be curious about whether companies themselves were a threat to user privacy.\u201cWhat are they capturing about you?\u201d he said. \u201cIs the data leaving the device? Is it being sent back to the mother ship?\u201dConsider the smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Amazon said its Alexa smart assistant, which is used in its Echo speakers, automatically downloads software updates to defend against new security threats. Data from the Echo is also uploaded to Amazon\u2019s servers only after people utter the wake word \u201cAlexa,\u201d the company said. That minimizes the likelihood that the device will record conversations unrelated to requests intended for Alexa.Google said its Home speaker similarly issued regular software updates and employed advanced security features, like a technique that disables the device if its software is tampered with. The company added that the speaker processed speech only after the words \u201cO.K. Google\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d were detected.Your Wi-Fi network is the pulse of your smart home, thus it is a vulnerable attack point. Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene suggest connecting all your smart home accessories \u2014 for example, your Amazon Echo, Nest thermostat, Samsung smart refrigerator and Philips Hue smart lights \u2014 onto a Wi-Fi network that is separate from the one connected to your computing devices, like your smartphone, tablet and computer.With two distinct Wi-Fi networks, it will be harder for a hacker to jump from infiltrating your smart accessory on one network to a personal computer on the other network, Mr. Arsene said.If you are paranoid about your Wi-Fi network being hacked, you can also change the Wi-Fi router\u2019s network settings to disable broadcasting the network name entirely, Mr. Britton said. That would make it difficult for a hacker driving by to detect and compromise your network, though it would also require house guests to manually type in your network name and password when they log on to your Wi-Fi.The same security principles for websites apply to the so-called internet of things. You should set strong, unique passwords for logging into each device you own. If you recycle your passwords and one device is compromised, the others can be, too.A strong password can be a random string of characters or a nonsensical phrase with numbers and special characters. (Examples: My favorite number is Green4782# or The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%.)While reputable manufacturers of smart home accessories offer software updates to patch security vulnerabilities, it is often up to the consumer to stay on top of updates. Because it lacks a screen, a smart light bulb or an internet-connected power socket is going to have a tough time informing you that it needs a software update.Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene recommend that consumers regularly log into the mobile apps or websites for their smart home accessories to check if they need software updates. If updates are available, install them immediately.With smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, there is an equivalent: a mute button to disable the device microphone so it can no longer listen. In the unlikely event that a device is hijacked, muting the microphone could help prevent hackers from listening to your conversations, Mr. Britton said.Or you could go the safest route and opt out of having these devices at all. That was the method chosen by Mr. Tien, the lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who previously studied the privacy risks of smart meters, the devices that utility companies use to monitor energy consumption.He said he accepted the privacy implications of owning a smartphone, but a smart home accessory?\u201cI think it\u2019s sort of asking to have your privacy invaded to have something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the value of it is really all that great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now It Works With Them.", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2011, Brett King was promoting his book, \u201cBreaking Banks,\u201d and creating a start-up that he hoped would do to the banks what Amazon did to the retail industry and Facebook did to media.\u201cWe had grand ideas of being the Facebook of banking, and being a new form of bank account,\u201d Mr. King said recently.Six years later, his company, Moven, has opened only 60,000 of those new bank accounts. Mr. King has now transitioned to selling his software to the banks he once scorned, who use it as a component of their mobile apps.\u201cWe realized that if you want millions of users as a bank, it is a very different proposition than building a social media network,\u201d he said.Silicon Valley has upended a growing number of industries, and it had seemed not too long ago that Wall Street would soon be next. A flurry of financial start-ups rose quickly and grabbed billions of dollars in investments.Mr. King is just one of the many technology entrepreneurs who have since recently run into the enormous moats that surround and protect the existing financial industry.The venture capitalists who have invested billions of dollars in this wave of new financial technology \u2014 think Venmo and Bitcoin \u2014 have been left waiting for a breakout star that actually looks like a threat to even a part of the big banks\u2019 business.\u201cA lot of people set out saying, \u2018We are going to displace the banks,\u2019\u201d said Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist at 500 Startups who focuses on financial technology. \u201cWe realized along the way that you really have no choice but to work with the banks.\u201dAnd the difficulty of denting the influence and power of the big banks is only likely to get harder under the Trump administration.President Trump has said he wants to encourage innovation and new business by cutting back on regulations of all sorts, including financial regulations.Yet it was the regulations passed after the financial crisis that forced the big banks to reduce their risks in many areas and provided an opening for start-ups like Moven, which were willing to take more risks.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle those post-crisis regulations is widely expected to give the big banks more free rein and close the window of opportunity for newcomers.\u201cThe degree to which banks have been caught under the yoke of regulatory obligations is very likely to lighten up under Trump,\u201d said Arjan Sch\u00fctte, the founder of the venture capital firm Core Innovation Capital, which focuses on financial technology.Mr. Sch\u00fctte has been moving his firm\u2019s investments away from bank disrupters and toward start-ups that are set up to partner with existing financial institutions.Even if there has not been a disruption of the big banks, basic financial services available to consumers are changing rapidly, nonetheless.Americans are now able to send each other money instantly from their phones, thanks to Venmo, and can get approved for a loan in minutes, also from their phone.The consulting firm McKinsey estimated in a report last month that digital disruption could put $90 billion, or 25 percent of bank profits, at risk over the next three years as services become more automated and more tellers are replaced by chatbots.Much of this change, however, is now expected to come from the banks themselves as they absorb new ideas from the technology world and shrink their own operations, without necessarily losing significant numbers of customers to start-ups.Venmo, for, instance, has captured the wallets of many young Americans, but the largest banks have all begun their own versions of the service and some of them say that they already process, as single banks, more instant personal payments than Venmo.The large banks are also teaming up to start a cross-industry mobile phone application, Zelle, that will take Venmo head-on in 2017.Venmo, which was acquired by PayPal, is still trying to find a way to make money from the business, which is currently offered primarily as a free service.Financial start-ups are not facing the same challenges everywhere in the world. In China, the technology company Ant Financial has grown to 450 million users since spinning off from the e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Ant Financial now processes a majority of online payments in China.Ant Financial has used its position as an electronic, phone-based wallet to grab lots of other financial business from Chinese consumers, offering online loans, insurance and investment advice to its hundreds of millions of customers.China has four of the five most valuable financial technology start-ups in the world, according to CB Insights, with Ant Financial leading the way at $60 billion. And investments in financial technology rose 64 percent in China last year, while they were falling 29 percent in the United States, according to CB Insights.In Africa, the financial industry has been shaken up by the rise of new forms of mobile phone-based payment systems like M-Pesa, in Kenya, which was started by the local mobile phone operator rather than a bank, and has risen to become the dominant form of payment in the country.The obvious reason that financial start-ups have not achieved the same level of growth in the United States is that most Americans already have access to a relatively functional set of financial products, unlike in Africa and China.Some start-ups looked at becoming banks, so they could offer deposit insurance \u2014 among other things \u2014 but they generally found that getting a bank charter required more time and money than is available to even the most successful start-ups. This left most start-ups reliant on banks to hold and move any money they collected from customers.\u201cOperating in America, you needed to get a gatekeeper to approve your access to the networks,\u201d said Josh Reich, who sold his banking start-up, Simple, to the Spanish banking giant BBVA. \u201cIf we wanted to touch their money, we needed to be part of the banking system.\u201dOnline lenders were particularly ambitious in trying to take on the banks from outside the system. Lending Club, which makes personal loans, and OnDeck, which focuses on small business loans, initially grew swiftly and went public, but both companies have run up against the limits of how fast a lending business can grow without being a bank.The online lenders have struggled with the high cost of acquiring new customers through marketing, which is not as necessary in other industries that have been disrupted by technology.At a more fundamental level, online lenders realized how hard it was to fund the new loans they wanted to give out without having access to cheap deposits, as the banks do.The shares of both Lending Club and OnDeck are now trading far below where they were on the day they went public.One notable success among the new lenders has been SoFi, or Social Finance, but even it has captured only about 250,000 customers, as compared to the 160 million users of Snapchat, the social network that was founded the same year.Start-ups focused on improving payments have had more success \u2014 the most valuable recent American technology start-up is Stripe, which helps new companies accept online payments.But Stripe and other payment start-ups like Square are all built on top of the existing credit card and banking infrastructure and have not posed any type of fundamental threat or challenge to the existing giants.\u201cWe are explicitly not a threat to the banks,\u201d Tim Drinan, a spokesman for Stripe, said. \u201cFrom our perspective the banks and card networks have built something pretty good and pretty hard to replicate.\u201dPerhaps the most ambitious recent project aimed at upending the banks was Bitcoin, which promised a new way to hold and move money, totally outside the existing banking system.The virtual currency has not taken off as a way to hold and spend money on a day-to-day basis, as many of its enthusiasts had predicted.At the same time, in a pattern that has been repeated elsewhere in the financial industry, the big banks have been making big investments aimed at harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin \u2014 known as the blockchain \u2014 for their own purposes.Tim Swanson, an early Bitcoin follower and analyst who now works with the blockchain consulting firm R3, said that Bitcoin wasn\u2019t able to fulfill the marketing promises that were made for it back in 2012.\u201cIt may take some time, but if there is anyone that has the capital base and the developer base to see this through, it\u2019s the banks for sure,\u201d Mr. Swanson said.An article on Thursday about technology start-ups\u2019 efforts to take on the financial industry misstated the year that PayPal acquired Venmo. It was 2013, not 2009.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Plan Is Most Unfriendly to Outsiders", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorSnap Inc. is aiming to adopt the most shareholder-unfriendly governance in an initial public offering, ever.It is different from its predecessors, Facebook and Google, which went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. In recent years, Facebook and Google have revised this structure to add a nonvoting third class of shares to preserve founder control, yet shareholders have had at least some vote even if they couldn\u2019t sway the results.Snap has followed the natural evolution of this disenfranchisement, simply eliminating shareholder rights from the get-go. And this is not just about replicating the venture capital model, where founders get control but investors get board seats and veto rights over significant transactions. Here, Snap is not even giving crumbs.For gurus of good corporate governance, this is bad enough, but once you dig into the details of how this nonvoting stock works, it gets much worse for shareholders.Snap has set up three share classes. Class A will be offered to the public. These shares have no voting rights and no hope of ever having voting rights.Class B shares have one vote each and are convertible into Class A stock. These are shares held by prior investors and employees.Then there are the Class C shares, with 10 votes each, which are convertible into Class B stock. These shares are held in equal number by the two Snap co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy. Specifically, each of them holds 107,943,924 Class C shares. These shares will give the two men complete voting control over Snap.The two founders have a proxy arrangement that transfers voting control to the other if one dies, but it doesn\u2019t cover whether they vote their shares together while alive, so presumably they could deadlock. Snap has solved this problem by granting a performance stock award to Mr. Spiegel that will be 3 percent of the company\u2019s post-I.P.O. value.This award will be paid out in equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in the third full quarter after the offering. After this, Mr. Spiegel will have total control over Snap and Mr. Murphy will simply be a close second.Snap, which looks a lot like Twitter did at its I.P.O. stage, could also experience bumps in the road as Twitter did. In its prospectus, Snap calls itself a camera company, but it really has just one product, Snapchat, which is beloved by the younger crowd for its disappearing photos and texts.Facebook, Google and Microsoft as well as Amazon have survived because of the ability to provide multiple successful offerings. Twitter has struggled with just one product \u2014 the platform on which people the world over, including the American president, send 140-character messages called tweets.If things are going well, no one is going to question Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy\u2019s control. But if things are bad, then shareholder complaints may be valid, a spur to action. Indeed, control makes sense only if shareholders and the two executives disagree about whether things are going well. But that assumes that shareholders will be irrational or wrong or not know as much as the two men at the helm. The last point may have some validity \u2014 but is it worth complete disenfranchisement, again given that Snap is a very early-stage company and Mr. Spiegel is so young?I suppose it all might be palatable for most diversified investors in exchange for the huge potential upside, except for the last two parts of this scheme. First, in October Snap issued a dividend of one Class A share for each Class C share the two men owned. The result was to allow Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy to sell half their shares without worry of losing control. The company could reload this at any point, issuing out another dividend of Class A shares if the two need more money.So, barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die. This raises some interesting possibilities.Hypothetical Scenario 1: Mr. Spiegel is hit by a bus and dies. Mr. Murphy would now have complete control of the company. Yet Mr. Spiegel is supposed to be the visionary executive who justified this voting structure. Or is Mr. Murphy, 28, equally visionary? (Or perhaps it is more likely they are just executing well on the \u201cdisappearing pictures\u201d concept just as Mark Cuban executed well on \u201cinternet radio\u201d before selling broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for billions of dollars.)Hypothetical Scenario 2: At age 30, Mr. Spiegel decides that life as a billionaire married to a supermodel (he\u2019s engaged to Miranda Kerr) is more fun spent on an island in the Pacific. He quits his job but still holds Class C shares and wields his power to elect directors and run the company part time.Hypothetical Scenario 3: Mr. Spiegel continues to hold the shares and keep his day job and at age 50 is head of a middling internet company with great potential, but he refuses to give up control, or starts behaving erratically.Potential investors, particularly the big money managers like the BlackRocks of the world, should likely be asking themselves: Is it all worth it, given the risks? I\u2019d note here that Google has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Mr. Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook nonvoting stock. Does Mr. Spiegel deserve better than that? And remember the other tech titans, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, all have one share, one vote.In its prospectus, Snap says its team is \u201ckind, smart and creative,\u201d which is kind of like Whitney Houston singing, \u201cI believe that children are the future.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot of other stuff about growth and big ideas. Snap may be right, and Evan Spiegel truly is the second coming, but this just does not justify the extreme governance given the risk. Instead, it just seems silly, but not in the fun Snapchat sort of way.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "SpaceX Launches Rocket Carrying Space Station Cargo", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. \u2014 Engines ignited and a rocket lifted off here on Sunday, for the first time since the last space shuttle launch five and a half years ago.A Falcon 9 rocket from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corporation \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 was launched, quickly disappearing into a low cloud deck, with 5,500 pounds of supplies, experiments and other cargo headed to the International Space Station.The Dragon cargo capsule is to arrive at the station on Wednesday. A robotic arm will grab the capsule and take it to one of the docking ports.\u201cAll is looking great,\u201d Jessica Jensen, the director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said in a news conference after the launch. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any issues.\u201dSpaceX was again able to recover the booster stage. As the second stage ignited to push the cargo capsule to orbit, the booster turned around back toward land. Eight minutes after it left the ground, it set down on a landing site a few miles away. It was the eighth successful landing and the third on land. (The other landings occurred on floating platforms in the ocean.)A launch attempt on Saturday was called off with 13 seconds left because of what Mr. Musk described as \u201cslightly odd\u201d readings with a backup motor for steering the engine nozzle on the second stage.In response to a question posted on Twitter by a MSNBC producer, Mr. Musk said that he called off the launch to take a closer look to make sure the readings were not a sign of a more significant, undetected problem.In another post, Mr. Musk wrote, \u201c1% chance isn\u2019t worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.\u201dOvernight, SpaceX technicians swapped out the mechanism. The odd readings did not recur during Sunday\u2019s countdown. .SpaceX hopes to catch up on its jammed schedule, which was delayed after the explosion. It plans to launch a used rocket \u2014 one of the recovered boosters \u2014 this spring. The next cargo mission for NASA is to be the first to reuse a capsule from a previous flight. The launch of the Falcon Heavy, a larger rocket years behind schedule, is aimed for summer. And by the end of the year, the company wants to test a rocket and capsule that is to lead to ferrying astronauts to the space station.Beyond the resumption of SpaceX\u2019s space station deliveries, Sunday\u2019s launch also marked a transition of the Kennedy Space Center toward private use of the facilities.In 2014, SpaceX took over a former space shuttle launchpad that NASA no longer needed. \u201cThis pad would have just sat here and rusted away in the salt air had we not had the use agreement with SpaceX,\u201d Robert D. Cabana, the space center director, said at a news conference in front of the launchpad on Friday. \u201cWhat an awesome use of a great American asset.\u201dLaunchpad 39A was where the space shuttle Atlantis lifted off on July 8, 2011, on the last shuttle mission, and was home to the first shuttle launch in 1981. It was also the starting point for all but one of the manned Apollo missions, including Apollo 11, the first moon landing, in 1969.The cancellation by the Obama administration of Constellation, a program intended to send astronauts back to the moon, led many to wonder whether the Kennedy Space Center had much of a future. The revised vision for NASA, unveiled in early 2010, called for a five-year hiatus in rocket development to allow investment in innovative but unready technologies \u2014 and nothing on the horizon to launch from Kennedy. (Launching continued at Cape Canaveral.)Mr. Cabana recast Kennedy from a center dedicated to launching NASA rockets to what he described a \u201cmultiuser spaceport.\u201dAt the Friday news conference, Gwynne Shotwell, the president of SpaceX, said the response of company officials was, \u201cThe hell we won\u2019t fly before 2019!\u201dMs. Shotwell said the cracks were long known and represented an acceptable risk for current satellite and cargo missions. She said the company had incorporated a fix in the next upgrade of the Falcon 9 rocket, which is to fly later this year.On Twitter, Mr. Musk said, \u201cI feel very confident of 2018.\u201dHowever, NASA still had no use for launchpad 39A or many of the other buildings that had been used for the space shuttle program. The other former shuttle pad, 39B, is sufficient to handle up to three Space Launch System launches a year, Mr. Cabana said. Currently, NASA envisions a pace of one launch every one or two years.With its lease, SpaceX dismantled some of the shuttle infrastructure, built a large hangar for storing its rockets and refurbished the pad to handle the Falcon 9, the Falcon Heavy and NASA astronaut launches.\u201cWe want to see more launches, government and commercial, off all these pads,\u201d Mr. Cabana said.The rocket launched Sunday carried Sage III, an instrument to be installed on the space station to measure levels of ozone, aerosols and dust in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere for at least three years. It is latest in a series of instruments that have made similar measurements since the late 1970s.Another instrument will track lightning. The cargo capsule is also carrying a demonstration project to test autopilot navigation technologies for eventual use by robotic spacecraft to repair satellites.Plans for sending a Dragon capsule with instruments but no people to land on Mars have slipped to 2020 from 2018, Ms. Shotwell said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will You Graduate? Ask Big Data", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt Georgia State\u2019s nursing school, the faculty used to believe that students who got a poor grade in \u201cConceptual Foundations of Nursing\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t go on to graduation. So they were surprised, after an analysis of student records stretching back a decade, to discover what really made a difference for nursing students: their performance in introductory math.\u201cYou could get a C or an A in that first nursing class and still be successful,\u201d said Timothy M. Renick, the vice provost. \u201cBut if you got a low grade in your math courses, by the time you were in your junior and senior years, you were doing very poorly.\u201dThe analysis showed that fewer than 10 percent of nursing students with a C in math graduated, compared with about 80 percent of students with at least a B+. Algebra and statistics, it seems, were providing an essential foundation for later classes in biology, microbiology, physiology and pharmacology.Georgia State is one of a growing number of colleges and universities using what is known as predictive analytics to spot students in danger of dropping out. Crunching hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of student academic and personal records, past and present, they are coming up with courses that signal a need for intervention.Health care companies and sports teams have been working with predictive analytics for years. But the approach is in its early stages on campuses. A handful of companies have sprung up in the last few years, working with perhaps 200 universities. They identify trends in the data and create computer programs that monitor student progress and alert advisers when students go off historically successful pathways.Dr. Renick uses Amazon to suggest how predictive analytics work. \u201cWhen Amazon looks at all your choices of books and makes predictions that you\u2019ll like other books, it doesn\u2019t need to know why you\u2019ll like the third book,\u201d he said. \u201cOur big data doesn\u2019t need to know exactly why a student gets a bad grade. It just happens thousands and thousands of times. We\u2019re looking at a pattern.\u201dAt the University of Arizona, a high grade in English comp proved to be crucial to graduation. Only 41 percent of students who got a C in freshman writing ended up with a degree, compared with 61 percent of the B students and 72 percent of A students.\u201cWe always figured that if a student got a C, she was fine,\u201d said Melissa Vito, a senior vice provost. \u201cIt turns out, a C in a foundation course like freshman composition can be an indicator that the student is not going to succeed.\u201d The university now knows it needs to throw more resources at writing, specifically at those C students.At Middle Tennessee State University, History 2020, an American history course required for most students, has been a powerful predictor. The most consistent feature for those who did not graduate was that they received a D in it. \u201cHistory is a heavy reading course,\u201d said Richard D. Sluder, vice provost for student success, \u201cso it signifies a need for reading comprehension.\u201dBefore predictive analytics, Dr. Sluder said, many of the D\u2019s went unnoticed. That\u2019s because advisers were mainly monitoring grade-point averages, not grades in specific courses. \u201cYou take a student who\u2019s getting A\u2019s and B\u2019s and you see a C in this one class,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2019d say, \u2018He looks fine.\u2019 But, really, he was at risk.\u201dSuch insight may revolutionize the way student advising works.Among the historic data that the education tech companies analyze are SAT and ACT scores; personal and demographic information; courses that students are taking and grades they are getting; and behaviors like how frequently they are seeing advisers and tutors and how actively they are engaging in the campus networks where professors post homework assignments, lecture notes, comments and grades.The analytics programs know the paths that successful students have followed. When a student veers off that path, like getting a low grade in a predictor course or taking a course out of sequence, advisers get an alert, a signal to reach out to the student and offer suggestions.One perennial problem is that students register for the wrong classes. \u201cStudents think they\u2019re signing up for a particular lab for chem majors,\u201d Dr. Renick said, \u201cbut it turns out to be for nonmajors. In the past we might not learn about that until the student was already in the class or even after he had finished the course. Now we\u2019re getting an alert and we get the student into the right class. We had 2,000 students like this last year.\u201dThe advisers are linked so that their notes and meetings with students are available for colleagues, just as doctors in hospital systems share notes on patients.Most universities have not been using big data long enough to see improvement in four- or six-year graduation rates. But some evidence indicates a positive impact. The schools that have seen some success have combined analytics with significant investment in other initiatives. Georgia State has more than doubled its advising staff, to about 100, and now meets the national standard of one adviser for 300 students. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy load,\u201d Dr. Renick said, \u201cbut in the past we had 750 to one.\u201d In 2016, Georgia State\u2019s four-year graduation rate rose 5 percentage points, to 27 percent, and the six-year rate rose 6 points, to 54 percent.\u201cAll of this is important,\u201d said Dr. Sluder. \u201cBut the technology is crucial. Take out all the technology and you just don\u2019t get that end result.\u201d Freshman retention at Middle Tennessee has risen 5 percentage points, to 76 percent, in just two years.A few universities are developing their own programs. In September, students at Stanford began using a digital tool based on 15 years of data that helps them in the daunting task of choosing from among some 5,000 undergraduate classes.\u201cNo single adviser, however wise and alert, can possibly be aware of all the instructional opportunities,\u201d said Mitchell L. Stevens, an associate professor of education who led in the development of the program.Freshmen at the University of Michigan began using a tool in the fall that mixes their personal and academic data with data on how earlier students did, advice from them and study guides from professors. After students complete a survey about their expectations for success in a course, the program digs into the data to see if those expectations are realistic. When they sign on, it takes them through questions and answers in what feels like a conversation.\u201cHello, Kate. You told us that the grade you want to receive is a B. This is a good goal for you. You should be more confident that you can achieve this! What if you aim for an even higher grade?\u201d\u201cWe are measuring social interaction,\u201d Dr. Ram said. \u201cHow many people do they tend to hang out with for different activities, and is their hanging out dropping off week by week or getting stronger? A lot of theoretical work has been done on this.\u201dThe findings are put into algorithms to predict who is in danger of not making it to sophomore year.\u201cMost of the predictive-analytics people are looking at grades,\u201d Dr. Ram said. \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s not the grades but whether they feel comfortable and socially integrated. If they are not socially integrated, they drop out.\u201dDr. Ram has tracked nearly 30,000 students over the last three years. Matching her findings against actual dropouts, she said, she has an accuracy rate of about 85 percent, but her project is still in the testing phase. She says identities are kept private.\u201cThere are risks,\u201d Mr. Kurzweil said. \u201cBut I think the people in predictive analytics are mostly white hats, and they\u2019re doing it because they really believe they\u2019re helping students.\u201dStill, he described the field as a little like the Wild West: \u201cThey\u2019ve pushed ahead quickly without setting up the kinds of standards and governance that will mitigate risk.\u201dIn June, Ithaka S\u2009+\u2009R and a team from Stanford brought together 73 specialists from universities, analytics companies, foundations and the Department of Education for three days of discussion on developing standards and ethical guidelines for big data on college campuses. They met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds on the Monterey Peninsula, where 41 years earlier scientists started work on the first guidelines for genetic research.Some universities are staying on the sidelines. The financial commitment \u2014 a half-million dollars or more over the course of a three-year contract that includes data analysis, software and training \u2014 is significant. Some are simply uneasy about the concept, Mr. Kurzweil said, or are not convinced predictive analytics really works.Laura Mercer, chief of staff to the president of Sinclair College, a two-year school in Dayton, Ohio, tells a story to counter that view.

{"Headline": "Neil Gaiman on His \u2018Norse Mythology,\u2019 in Which Odin Wants a Wall", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe action begins as the Norse gods, worried that their home in Asgard is vulnerable to alien incursions, debate how to make its borders more secure. \u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d one asks Odin, the most powerful of them all.\u201cA wall,\u201d Odin responds.\u201cNorse Mythology\u201d is a playful retelling of ancient northern stories about the creation of the world and other pressing matters featuring Odin; Thor, the not-so-bright god with the hammer; and Loki, the god who makes all the trouble.It\u2019s of a piece with what Mr. Gaiman likes to do: find something he thinks is interesting and see where it leads him. His work reflects his restless spirit, encompassing science fiction, fantasy, fairy tales, children\u2019s books, adult books, comic books, screenplays, short stories, essays and poetry. His best-known books include \u201cNeverwhere,\u201d an urban fantasy about a place beneath London for those who fall through the cracks of the regular city; and the deliciously creepy \u201cCoraline,\u201d a children\u2019s book about a girl who stumbles upon what seems to be, but is not, an ideal alternative family.Why these particular myths and not, say, Greek ones? Mr. Gaiman, who was introduced to the Norse tales through Marvel\u2019s Mighty Thor comic books as a child in England in the 1960s, was attracted, partly, by their flawed protagonists and satisfyingly dark worldview.\u201cGreek myths are full of sex and peacocks,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of sitting outside and falling in love with your own reflection. No one\u2019s doing that in Norse mythology. You sit outside in the winter, you\u2019re dead.\u201dHis new book starts with the beginning of the world and ends with its destruction by ice and fire and darkness before hope is restored, gingerly and tentatively, with the beginnings of a new earth from the ruins of the old one. Its message seems relevant just now.So he included emotions, motivations, snappy dialogue, sly Gaimanian flourishes. He spruced up the roles of the goddesses, who are traditionally poorly treated by the sexist gods but who stand up for themselves in his telling. (\u201cWhat kind of person do you think I am?\u201d the goddess Freya asks, when she hears about a dubious deal to marry her off to an ogre.)\u201cI\u2019m trying to write a book that a Norse scholar is not going to go, \u2018He\u2019s got it so completely wrong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gaiman said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not telling it for a Norse scholar. What I want to do is tell you the story and make it work as a story.\u201dHis novel-in-progress is a sequel to \u201cNeverwhere.\u201d Just as that book was a \u201cway of talking about homelessness and mental illness and the dispossessed without really talking about them,\u201d he said in the interview, the new work will partly be about the plight of refugees in a city struggling to adjust at a bewildering moment.\u201cLondon post-Brexit, and the world, are in a horrible, messy state,\u201d he said, referring to Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union. \u201cI can take all the anger that I feel and put it into a book.\u201dAt the Town Hall appearance, Mr. Gaiman treated fans to the official trailer from \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d as well as to the trailer for a forthcoming movie based on an old short story he wrote called \u201cHow to Talk to Girls at Parties.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s the finest Romeo and Juliet story with punks and aliens set in 1977 in Croydon that has ever been made,\u201d he declared.)The crowd, hundreds of people clutching old books for the author to sign afterward, loved those things, and they loved Mr. Gaiman\u2019s Q. and A. with questions submitted by the audience.He talked about his first book, a rock biography of Duran Duran. And then someone asked him what he wanted for his epitaph.He thought about that for a moment. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s actually under here,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oscar-Nominated Movies, Sometimes Streaming Near You", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingOne common complaint about the Oscars addresses the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 perceived tendency to honor movies that ostensibly no one has seen. In some cases, the complainants are talking about prestige films that didn\u2019t do a lot at the box office. A couple of months ago, I was listening to a podcast featuring two of the West Coast\u2019s more colorful Oscar commentators, and one of them excitedly put \u201cLa La Land\u201d in the category of films no one has seen. At the time, the movie, a critical favorite among festivalgoers, had not yet been released. Oscar commentators can be very silly people.\u201cLa La Land\u201d has since gone into something like wide release \u2014 it\u2019s in about 2,000 theaters, about half the number that super-wide releases will be in at the height of their glory \u2014 and is doing well enough that you can say some people have seen it, and now that it has garnered 14 Oscar nominations, more people will.This year, streaming video services are beginning to change how Oscar-nominated movies are seen, for one very simple reason: These services are financing, producing and distributing movies they hope will win Oscars. \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d distributed by Amazon Studios, landed six nominations, including for best picture. While it\u2019s still playing in theaters (a little over 500, as of this writing), it will hit video on demand and be available for download for a fee from Amazon and other services, including FandangoNow, in early February. It will start streaming on Amazon in May, when it will be free for Prime members.Right now, one of the five nominees for best documentary, Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201c13th,\u201d is on Netflix, the company that produced the movie. One of this year\u2019s other best documentary nominees, \u201cO.J.: Made in America,\u201d in fact, aired as a television mini-series after a brief theatrical qualifying run, and has been available on demand since it first ran on ESPN.Of the other nominees for best picture besides \u201cManchester,\u201d only the crime thriller \u201cHell or High Water\u201d (which also drew a best supporting actor nod for Jeff Bridges and an original screenplay one for Taylor Sheridan) can be seen on YouTube, Amazon Video, iTunes, Vudu and Google Play at prices from $2.99 to $14.99 depending on the rent-buy option you choose. Viggo Mortensen\u2019s nominated leading-man turn in the hippie-family tear-jerker \u201cCaptain Fantastic\u201d can also be viewed via those services. So, too, can one of the more distinctive of the best animated feature nominees, \u201cKubo and the Two Strings.\u201dMeryl Streep in the title role of the tragicomic biopic \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d can be seen via all the same services save Amazon. Another best actress nominee, Ruth Negga, was recognized for her work in the fact-based civil rights drama \u201cLoving\u201d; that picture can be seen for a fee on Vudu, Amazon and iTunes. Michael Shannon was considered a surprise in the best supporting actor category for his work in \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d; the movie is not coming to streaming as such, but it will debut on demand on Feb. 21, the same day the Blu-ray and DVD package, which includes access to a digital download, comes out.I was actually a little surprised, looking at the home pages of several streaming services on Tuesday, when the nominations were announced, to not see much in the way of Oscar promotion. However many viewers tune in on the big night or not, the Oscars are an arguably potent form of clickbait, and even if major nominated films haven\u2019t made it to streaming yet, the services themselves teem with work by the nominees.The Greek cinematic provocateur Yorgos Lanthimos earned a screenplay nomination for \u201cThe Lobster\u201d (available on Amazon Video); his discomfiting earlier features \u201cDogtooth\u201d and \u201cAlps\u201d are on Fandor, a conscientious cinephile site that gives Amazon Prime users a free trial. \u201cMedicine for Melancholy,\u201d the first feature by Barry Jenkins, whose haunting \u201cMoonlight\u201d garnered eight nominations, including best picture and director, is on iTunes and Amazon. Given that \u201cMoonlight\u201d is just Mr. Jenkins\u2019s second feature, there\u2019s not much of a remove between the films.Similarly, one can view all of the previous features of Damien Chazelle, the director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d via Amazon Prime. Fandor has his \u201cGuy and Madeline on a Park Bench\u201d (2009), while Prime carries \u201cWhiplash\u201d (2014). For good measure, on Amazon there\u2019s also another music-themed picture for which Chazelle wrote the screenplay, the 2013 novelty thriller \u201cGrand Piano.\u201d (Amazon has \u201cThe Last Exorcism 2,\u201d which was partly written by Mr. Chazelle; he is also one of five credited screenwriters on the more respectable horror movie \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d for rent or purchase on major sites.)Finally, a warning: Be on the lookout for purveyors of pirated content who piggyback on legitimate services like Vimeo. For example, in my searches I came across results saying the animated film \u201cTrolls\u201d (yes, it has an Oscar nominee for best song: Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling!\u201d) and \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d were streaming in full on the aforementioned site. But they are not. (And \u201cAnimals\u201d has since been removed.) Once you hit play and the studio logo comes up, you are asked to \u201cregister\u201d and log in with a separate \u201cservice.\u201d I declined to do this, and I would advise you to do the same.An earlier version of this article misstated the format in which \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d will be released in February. It will be available for download for a fee. It will not begin streaming until May on Amazon. The article also misstated the date that \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d will debut on demand. It is Feb. 21, not earlier in the month.Advertisement"}

Apple, the richest company in technology, is finally moving into original video content.Apple said Monday night that it would introduce its first two television-style video series on Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, in the spring.Other original videos, including scripted dramas, are planned over the next year as Apple tries to build Apple Music into a cultural platform, said Jimmy Iovine, who heads the $10-a-month service.\u201cThere are a bunch of projects.

Milana Rabkin, Stem\u2019s chief executive and one of its founders, compared the service to online payment apps that let friends easily split a restaurant tab.Stem\u2019s consensus model, however, could also be its Achilles\u2019 heel, since it will not allow any party to be paid until all agree on the splits, a process that gives holdouts bargaining power. Ms. Rabkin said that most projects reached consensus in a few days and that the longest had taken \u201ca couple months.\u201d The service takes a 5 percent cut on royalties.Representatives of Mr. Ocean declined to comment on exactly how he had used Stem. But aside from the album\u2019s initial appearance on Apple Music \u2014 when it was delivered directly to Apple \u2014 Stem appears to have been the vehicle used to release \u201cBlonde\u201d to most major services. Stem distributes music to Spotify, Apple, YouTube, Amazon, Tidal, SoundCloud and several other outlets.\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to reach a demographic that wants to create differently,\u201d said Kevin Breuner, the vice president of marketing at CD Baby. \u201cMusic distribution is a secondary thought to them.\u201dStem, by contrast, is catching on among a class of young professionals who often operate independently but may be involved in the highest creative levels of the business. Its clients include Childish Gambino and the electronic producer Deadmau5. The company says it has distributed 6,000 pieces of content that have been streamed 500 million times.Dina LaPolt, a lawyer representing Deadmau5, said her client was using Stem to track his music on YouTube, but explained that Stem\u2019s royalty-tracking system was particularly important to artists in managing the otherwise daunting task of tracking royalty splits.\u201cMusic is the only business in the world where the artist is responsible for doing all the paperwork,\u201d Ms. LaPolt said.The company\u2019s system, she said, allows her and friends to quickly and transparently arrange deals among themselves, maintaining control and minimizing any disruption to creativity.\u201cIt\u2019s essentially like a smart contract,\u201d Ms. Wise said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier and simpler, and I love easy and simple.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misstated the title of a Frank Ocean album.

All of the sudden, they say, students are recognizing their own country in Orwell\u2019s work of fiction.Below, a few ideas for pairing the themes in \u201c1984\u201d with what\u2019s happening in the world today, along with a full list of resources for teaching Orwell in general.Are you teaching the novel right now? Are your students\u2019 reactions different than in years past? What ideas should we add to our list? Let us know in the comments._________Keep a Running List of Parallels Between the Novel and Our World TodayAs they do the exercises below, have them continue to add to the chart. Then, whether they\u2019re writing a final essay or doing some other culminating project, they can draw on these lists of detail, quotes, observations and ideas they\u2019ve recorded._________Pair Some Recent Times Articles With the NovelHow many of the parallels that she notes are already on your students\u2019 lists? What new ones would they add?As the essay reminds us, the specifics are only those as of Jan. 26, when the piece was published \u2014 and \u201cof course, all of these developments are being constantly updated, with regular flurries of news and denials and counterdenials \u2014 a confusing state of affairs that itself would not have surprised Orwell, since he knew the value of such confusion to those in power.\u201dIf President Trump\u2019s first tumultuous weeks have done nothing else, at least they have again made us a nation of readers.As Americans grapple with the unreality of the new administration, George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d has enjoyed a resurgence of interest, becoming a surprise best seller and an invaluable guide to our post-factual world.On his first full day in office Mr. Trump insisted that his inaugural crowd was the largest ever, a baseless boast that will likely set a pattern for his relationship both to the media and to the truth.Mr. Sykes writes that \u201cAll administrations lie, but what we are seeing here is an attack on credibility itself.\u201d Do your students agree with his analysis, and his worry that, in the Orwellian age of Donald Trump, \u201cthe battle over truth is now central to our politics\u201d?__________________Ask Essential Questions Essential questions, as most teachers know, are questions that can be applied far beyond one novel or historical period. The best of them, in fact, are questions with which the world is still grappling.What is power, and how is it gained and used? What constitutes an abuse of power?Can individuals change a society?What are the dangers of government-controlled media?What can citizens do if power is abused by a ruling group or government?How is technology changing our understanding of privacy?What Is more important: our privacy or national security?How do governments balance the rights of individuals with the common good?Why do some individuals take a stand against oppression while others choose to participate in it?_________Apply Quotes from \u201c1984\u201d to the News TodayChallenge your students to choose one or more of the lines below and apply them to life in 2017 in as many ways as they can \u2014 starting, of course, by finding Times articles with which they resonate. (Even if, or maybe especially because, Orwell also once wrote, \u201cEarly in life I had noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper.\u201d)Big Brother is watching you.Double-think means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one\u2019s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.Don\u2019t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed \u2014 if all records told the same tale \u2014 then the lie passed into history and became truth.Until they became conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable \u2014 what then?Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power.The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink.One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.Understand the World of 1944:What was happening when Orwell was writing \u201c1984\u201d?What would it have been like to be read the daily newspaper as the world was at war? What \u201csinister symptoms\u201d that \u201cbring totalitarianism nearer,\u201d as Orwell phrased it in his letter, are hinted at in the headlines? And which headlines from the era are especially resonant in light of things happening in 2017?_________Create Something New to Show the Novel\u2019s Relevance TodayUse ideas from that lesson plan, such as pairing up to write and record podcasts in which one plays an interviewer and the other George Orwell, who answers questions about the novel and reacts to the modern world.Or, consider a few more:_________Debate How Widely This Book Should Be TaughtI have a responsibility \u2014 not to transform every liberal parent\u2019s progeny into a slightly sharper copy or radicalize future voters skeptical of politics, but to shore up their critical faculties, to make them more skilled readers, writers, and thinkers. And to also make them decent, compassionate, alert, engaged truth-seekers, neither callous, fearful Party enablers nor complacent, dead-eyed Proles who poke their iPhones and scoff at memes and chirp their discontent in brief blips of coherence. Bravery is something that people can be taught. Books may be the best teachers for what to do when the fireworks veer too close.Do your students agree?

{"Headline": "How Washington State Upended Trump\u2019s Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile President Trump\u2019s travel ban threw American airports into chaos last weekend, Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington State, was biding his time on an airplane.On his way home from a conference of Democratic attorneys general in Florida, Mr. Ferguson landed a week ago in the center of a political and legal firestorm. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was in disarray, with protests massing. Gov. Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat, had sent word to the attorney general\u2019s staff that he wanted to mount a battering-ram attack on the president\u2019s decree.A genial 51-year-old with an earnest demeanor, Mr. Ferguson cuts an unlikely figure as an antagonist for the most pugilistic president in modern times. He is seen in the state less as a chest-thumping showman than as a former member of the King County Council with a wonky sensibility and an eager manner.But Mr. Ferguson, by his own account and the description of his associates, was incensed and offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration restrictions. And having landed in Seattle on the first full day the ban was in effect \u2014 while demonstrations grew across the country \u2014 he went home to greet his family and then went to work devising a plan to cripple Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy.In an interview, Mr. Ferguson said he had concluded from the start that Mr. Trump\u2019s order was \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional,\u201d and that any appropriate response would have to aim at neutering it entirely. Eschewing the approach of other Democratic-leaning states, which have challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s order by highlighting the claims of individual plaintiffs, Mr. Ferguson and his office opted to draft a complaint arguing that the ban would cause drastic damage to Washington State as a whole.Mr. Ferguson said he had recognized at the time that this was a potentially risky approach, seeking a more sweeping victory with a comparatively untested legal strategy.But Mr. Ferguson, a former state chess champion, explained in precise language that he had decided it was a gamble worth taking.\u201cFrom my standpoint there is risk in everything, but I am someone who believes in calculated risk,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said in the interview. \u201cOne just needs to be comfortable with that. And when it comes to the constitutional rights of my people, the people I represent, I\u2019m prepared to take a calculated risk on their behalf.\u201dMr. Inslee, also in an interview, said he strongly backed Mr. Ferguson\u2019s approach, viewing Mr. Trump\u2019s order as a unique threat to their state\u2019s economy, which depends heavily on international trade, and to the state\u2019s diverse population. In his view, the governor said, the state was right to make \u201cany plausible claim\u201d to take down the order.Few other states adopted such a daring strategy. Mr. Ferguson said he had invited other Democratic attorneys general to join in his lawsuit, finding only one taker so far: Lori Swanson of Minnesota. Mr. Ferguson said there were other states still weighing whether to join him.Mr. Inslee described the Friday ruling as a special kind of victory for Washington State, which draws relatively little attention in national politics but tends to race ahead of national trends on social issues.\u201cIt\u2019s part of our nature and history,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. \u201cThis is the first time this administration has been reined in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Are the Richest of the Rich?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isn\u2019t a lot of money in 1997.Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, \u201cO.K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion.\u201dTwenty years after the movie \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d was released, billions of dollars aren\u2019t what they used to be, either.Bill Gates alone is just $10 billion shy of Dr. Evil\u2019s ransom demand, according to a list of the world\u2019s top 10 billionaires compiled by Wealth-X, a financial research firm. Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, tops the list at $89.3 billion, followed by his friend Warren Buffett at $73.5 billion.The top 10 \u2014 nine from the United States, one from Spain \u2014 have a combined net worth of $582 billion. While their wealth would certainly be enough to save the world from Dr. Evil, what they do with it in real life is the subject of great interest and debate.That is true now more than ever. Issues around money \u2014 like wealth inequality and talk of tax cuts for the rich \u2014 are among the hottest topics of the day. And the richest president in history is sitting in the Oval Office, with billionaires sprinkled throughout his cabinet.To some, today\u2019s billionaires are like Dr. Evil: selfish, rapacious and bent on world domination. To others, billionaires are worthy of respect for having put their names and fortunes behind an array of philanthropic endeavors, many aimed at improving the lives of people at the very base of the wealth pyramid.There were 2,473 billionaires in the world, as of Wealth-X\u2019s last count through 2015. That was a 6.4 percent increase in billionaires from the year before.But who these billionaires are and what they\u2019re like is more difficult to discern. Many may seem as ordinary as the guy sitting next to you on the train \u2014 or in Michael Bloomberg\u2019s case, standing beside you on the subway, when he was mayor of New York. (Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on Wealth-X\u2019s list.)There are certainly billionaires who want to save the world, like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bloomberg, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. Others in the top 10 are also philanthropic, but they are still focusing on their day jobs, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Alphabet (the parent of Google) \u2014 Nos. 4, 5 and 10.Yet many of the billionaires beyond the top 10 or 20 have a much lower profile. Who outside of finance or hockey knew of Vincent Viola, a former oil trader and current owner of the Florida Panthers, before President Trump nominated him to be secretary of the Army? Now that he has withdrawn, he can return to relative anonymity.For that matter, Wilbur L. Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, is the wealthiest of the president\u2019s billionaire cabinet picks. He would pop up in the headlines every few years for a deal he was making but then return to what could be called the quiet opulence of the billionaire class.\u201cThey\u2019re different in how they can invest their assets and what their portfolio may look like,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said. \u201cIn many ways, they face different risks, both personal risks and cyber risks, than the average individual does. They often think about structuring decisions differently from a succession-planning standpoint as well as the structure they create around themselves and their family.\u201dYet for most people, billionaires are just wealthy beyond belief. And these days, they are also much wealthier (and getting even more so) than the broader ultra-high-net-worth population.That group is defined as anyone with more than $30 million. In 2015, there were 212,615 of them. On the lower end, the 155,050 people worth between $30 million and $99 million had a combined $8.4 trillion. At the top, the world\u2019s 2,473 billionaires were worth $7.68 trillion.\u201cThere is growing inequality around the world, but there is also inequality among the ultrawealthy,\u201d said Maya Imberg, director of custom research at Wealth-X.Billionaires also matter because of the outsize influence they have, or believe they can have, on policy and public life. They can give millions to a political campaign, as Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, did with Mr. Trump, or as George Soros, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has done with liberal causes.But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group. How they amassed their billions, and how that pile is growing, tells a lot about the economy today.Just as the best teacher in the country is going to earn less money than a mediocre investment banker, the industries in which future billionaires begin their careers determine the magnitude of their wealth and how quickly it is going to grow.Six of the top 10 billionaires made their money in technology. But in Wealth-X\u2019s research, technology ranks sixth overall for the number of billionaires on the list, with 114 around the world.Finance has created the most billionaires, with 377, or 15 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires. It is followed by industrial conglomerates, with 317, or 13 percent.After that, the concentration in particular industries drops. Real estate is third with 141. The group of people who identify their industry as nonprofits (meaning they made their money some other way or inherited it) is fourth, with 122. Manufacturing, in fifth place, has 120.\u201cGlobalization has been a big trend,\u201d said Benjamin Kinnard, a research analyst at Wealth-X. \u201cThe market is now seven billion people, not just the size of your domestic country.\u201dHe added that finance had a bigger lead in first place several years ago, but it has been losing ground as industries like technology boom.A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other people\u2019s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified.The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance.And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts).While the number of billionaires in China is rising at a fast clip, the pace of growth in billionaires worldwide is slowing. Wealth-X said the number will be 3,250 by 2020, down 16 percent from an earlier prediction of 3,873. This is because economic growth is expected to slow around the world.Across the billionaire spectrum, the biggest proportion of billionaires\u2019 wealth \u2014 about half \u2014 is in the business that created the wealth in the first place, according to Wealth-X\u2019s research. After that, they have about a quarter of their money in public securities and a little less than a quarter in cash. Just 4 percent is in real estate and luxury assets, the research found.There are common strains to how they cross the billionaire line, regardless of industry: 57 percent are self-made, according to Wealth-X, and another 31 percent received an inheritance and grew it into billions.\u201cTiming has a lot to do with it,\u201d said John Mathews, head of private wealth management and the ultra-high-net-worth group at UBS. \u201cIf we looked back 100 years, it would have been a really great time to be in steel, railroad or infrastructure businesses. Today, it\u2019s a good time to be in technology and finance.\u201dBut there is a difference from the bottom of the billionaire ladder to the top: Most are on that first rung.Over half of all billionaires are worth between $1 billion and $2 billion. Go up to $5 billion and there are 2,101.And not all billionaires are household names.Ma Jianrong, executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group Holdings, which is the leading textile company in China and manufactures clothing for Nike, Adidas, Puma and Uniqlo, is worth $4.3 billion.Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, built his wealth through mining in South Africa after starting his career as a lawyer in the United States. He is now worth $2.1 billion.Kevin Systrom, chief executive of Instagram, is surely well known in Silicon Valley \u2014 and among students at Stanford University (his alma mater) who want to emulate his route to a net worth of $1.2 billion by age 33. But he is not as recognizable as Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook.But being a billionaire, as opposed to a very wealthy millionaire, can make a huge difference in the loss of privacy for a family. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to be anonymous,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said.And being known as billionaires opens them up to risks, she said, like cybersecurity breaches and attacks on their families.How single-digit billionaires add additional billions isn\u2019t always up to them.One way to become even wealthier is to have picked the right global industry in which to make your billions and hang on to your stake in your company as it booms \u2014 and avoids busts. Right now, the technology and finance industries are leading the growth. Another way is to make your money in the right region, which is Asia.Then, of course, there are the investment opportunities that only get presented to the wealthiest people, and that only they have the resources to take a chance on. \u201cThey can diversify their holdings to protect themselves,\u201d Mr. Kinnard said.And the big investments that are needed in private equity deals, for example, are a smaller portion of overall wealth for billionaires than for someone with, say, $100 million.\u201cThe common thread with billionaires is the incredibly focused drive these people have in whatever business they go into,\u201d Mr. Mathews said. \u201cIt\u2019s dogged determination. You can say everyone is like that, but with billionaires everything else gets blocked out. You see it today with tech the way you saw it with steel barons 100 years ago.\u201dYet getting across the billionaire line does not mean a person will always be there.\u201cOnce a billionaire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stay a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Mathews of UBS said. \u201cLast year alone there were 41 new billionaires created in the United States, but 36 also dropped out of billionaire status in the U.S. Our billionaire population is growing but only by a net of five.\u201dIn the United States, Mr. Mathews said, most people fall off the billionaire list because they sell the company that created their wealth. \u201cWhen you sell it, there are tax issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are estate-planning issues.\u201dThe latter results in chunks of money being given to heirs to get it out of the wealth creator\u2019s estate.Selling family firms happens less often in Europe and Asia. People end up holding on to them and creating family holding companies to continue to operate that original business and expand into others.Of course, people who sell their $1 billion company and end up with $500 million after taxes \u2014 or whose wealth tops out at $800 million \u2014 aren\u2019t scraping by. But being a billionaire gives you entry into an exclusive club that being a millionaire does not. After all, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s wealth from his career at Exxon Mobil looks positively modest. He\u2019s worth just a few hundred million.What is expected of people who have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes? It depends on whom you ask.\u201cIt is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when one in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day,\u201d Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam, said in a statement. \u201cInequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty. It is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.\u201dYet the anger against the superrich has abated since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Protesters seem to be more concerned with the actions of Mr. Trump (who is likely a billionaire, although he has provided little proof of his real wealth) than with his cabinet of plutocrats.Philanthropy has become important to many billionaires, and not just through the Giving Pledge, Mr. Buffett\u2019s compact to get the wealthiest to give away at least half of their fortunes. Nor is it confined to the United States, with its tradition of charitable giving.\u201cWhen I explained to him that New York City\u2019s annual school budget was $22 billion a year,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, \u201cthat was the last time we ever heard from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Living Lab: Reimagining Retail on Seattle Streets", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 On a busy stretch of road in this city\u2019s Ballard neighborhood, a curious new grocery store is taking shape \u2014 and so begins another effort by Amazon to use the residents of its hometown as guinea pigs.Amazon\u2019s success in online commerce has transformed Seattle by bringing jobs, wealth and an almost insatiable appetite for office space \u2014 along with grumbling about how expensive the city is getting. At the same time, the company is putting its stamp on the city by using it as a lab for its expanding array of unconventional experiments in bricks-and-mortar retailing.While Amazon has never articulated the grand strategy behind its expansion into physical stores, analysts and tech executives believe its goal is to capture a bigger share of some forms of shopping \u2014 food being the biggest \u2014 that may never move entirely online.Amazon isn\u2019t alone in using Seattle, home to Starbucks and other major retail brands, as a proving ground for new ideas in stores. But it is the main attraction among people focused on innovation in the category.Amazon declines to talk about the drive-up grocery stores it is building here. The most obvious reason the company tries out new ideas in its own backyard is that it makes life easier for corporate leadership to see them in action without having to get on planes. Executives closely scrutinize how customers use new stores and tweak them as they gather data.Amazon\u2019s own technologically demanding employees are an important part of the feedback process. More than 25,000 of them work for the company in Seattle, and many serve as the first test cases for new concepts.The company opened its first Amazon Go store on the ground floor of one of its office buildings, where employees can buy prepared meals, drinks and snacks. Customers enter the store through a gate with a smartphone app and simply walk out with their goods when they\u2019re done.Almost a decade ago, the company conducted one of its biggest local experiments when it started a grocery home delivery service, tinkering for almost five years before expanding the concept to a new city. Early on, Amazon allowed employees and their friends to use the service, which helped provide unvarnished feedback, said Ian Clarkson, then the general manager of the service, AmazonFresh.Mr. Clarkson recalls a friend telling him that AmazonFresh didn\u2019t stock a brand of orange juice her daughter liked. As a result, she said, she wouldn\u2019t shop through AmazonFresh since she would still need to go to a supermarket for the juice.Seattle has long been receptive to new ideas in retail. REI, Costco Wholesale and Nordstrom are among the store chains that got their start here. Starbucks opened its first coffee house in the Pike Place Market in 1971.Several years ago, it came up with a new idea for building drive-through Starbucks stores out of recycled shipping containers to promote sustainability, trying out the design just south of Seattle before opening others across the country.One of Amazon\u2019s more puzzling retail experiments in Seattle is the Treasure Truck, a roaming delivery truck retrofitted with carnival-style lights and signs, from which customers can pick up items offered during flash sales through the Amazon mobile app. The truck, which seems like the offspring of a billboard and an ice cream truck, has sold wild mahi-mahi steaks, paddle boards and Nintendo game consoles.\u201cSeattleites will say they hate Amazon taking over downtown, but at the same time when Amazon rolls out something special, after everyone complains about it, the first thing people want to do is go check it out,\u201d said Mr. Croft, who says his employment with another technology company doesn\u2019t color his views of Amazon.Not everyone agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t use any Amazon services,\u201d Sherman Alexie, the novelist and poet, who lives in Seattle, wrote in an email.The company\u2019s growth has contributed to a booming economy in its hometown, where the median single-family home price jumped to $548,000 last year from $340,000 five years ago, according to the Northwest Multiple Listing Service.As much as Seattle residents like technology, some say the population is more representative of the rest of the country than shoppers in other cities.\u201cSan Francisco is ludicrously tech-forward,\u201d said Dan Shapiro, the chief executive of a start-up, called Glowforge, that makes a laser cutting device. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me about Seattle is it\u2019s about as tech-friendly and prosperous as you can go without being completely off the rails.\u201dBut Elliott Bay had record sales last year, and he can\u2019t figure out why Amazon, with its size, would bother with the relatively low sales volumes of physical bookstores. Amazon\u2019s global book sales are estimated to be in the billions of dollars, which would dwarf the proceeds from an independent shop.\u201cI know these are very smart people,\u201d Mr. Aaron said. \u201cI assume there\u2019s some kind of design or plan that makes sense. I can\u2019t figure out why they\u2019re doing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To our whole crew, everyone that put their heart and souls into this film, I\u2019m going to find you all individually, and I\u2019m going to thank you, along with my friends, who I love so much. I\u2019m going to hug the hell out of you when the feeling re-enters my body.I still have a lot of growing and learning and work to do. And this guy [gestures toward her Oscar] is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey, and I am so grateful for that. So, thank you so much.Casey Affleck, best actor, \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201dIt means so much to me, thank you. Whew, damn it. One of the first people who taught me how to act was Denzel Washington, and I just met him tonight for the first time. Thank you. And to all the other nominees who did great work, I\u2019m proud to be in your company. You guys are very brave and I admire what you do.And I\u2019m only here, really, because of all the talents and good will of so many people that are impossible to name. But most of all, Kenneth Lonergan, who made this part \u2014 and without this part, and without his writing, I wouldn\u2019t be here for sure. And how well he directed it. Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say, but I\u2019m just really proud to be a part of this community in general. Thank you also to Matt Damon for creating this opportunity. Of course, my mother and my father for mostly believing in me. And Ben, I love you. You ain\u2019t heavy. Thank you all very much.Damien Chazelle, best director, \u201cLa La Land\u201dI just want to first thank my fellow nominees. I was absolutely honored and floored to be in your company this year. So, Barry [Jenkins], Kenny [Lonergan], Mel [Gibson], Denis [Villeneuve] \u2014 but I know you\u2019re here somewhere. Just thank you for what incredible filmmakers you are and for inspiring me with your work every day.I want to thank the people who helped me make this movie: my crew, my team, everyone at Lionsgate for taking a chance on it. Ryan and Emma for bringing it to life. John [Legend] for acting alongside them and now doing me very proud here on this stage. And I want to thank Justin [Hurwitz, who composed the score], who I\u2019ve known since we were both 17, 18, I think. Justin, thank you for riding with me on this, and carrying this dream forward, and for never giving up. Thank you.... And finally, I want to thank Olivia, my love, sitting there. This was a movie about love, and I was lucky enough to fall in love while making it. And it means the world to me that you\u2019re here with me sharing it.Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney, best adapted screenplay, \u201cMoonlight\u201dJenkins: You know, I tell my students that I teach sometimes: Be in love with the process, not the result. But I really wanted this result because a bajillion people are watching, and all you people out there who feel like there\u2019s no mirror for you, that your life is not reflected, the academy has your back, the A.C.L.U. has your back, we have your back, and for the next four years, we will not leave you alone. We will not forget you.McCraney: I also want to say thank God for my mother, who proved to me through her struggles and the struggles that Naomie Harris portrayed for all of you, that we can really be here and be somebody. Two boys from Liberty City [in Miami, where they grew up and where the film is set] up here on this stage. This goes out to all those black and brown boys and girls and non-gender-conforming who don\u2019t see themselves. We\u2019re trying to show you you, and us.

{"Headline": "How Nicole Kidman Puts Women First in Hollywood", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "With her production company and her new HBO show, \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Ms. Kidman is helping to ensure that complicated stories about women reach the screen.Supported byThe subject was \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d the seven-episode series that she co-produced (and stars in) with Reese Witherspoon and that will begin airing on HBO on Sunday, Feb. 19. Based on the best-selling book by Liane Moriarty, the series features five women \u2014 the other three are played by Shailene Woodley, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern \u2014 in an upscale part of Monterey, Calif., that lends itself to social satire. As the story opens, parental warfare is threatening to break out following an unpleasant incident at the local elementary school.First on the agenda: how to market \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d to reflect the humor, but also the serious drama and frothy melodrama.Ms. Kidman said she wanted to ensure that domestic violence, perhaps the story\u2019s darkest theme (unless you count homicide) received proper public attention and was not overshadowed by the outr\u00e9 histrionics. \u201cWe want to navigate it properly and to instigate some discussion about it around the show,\u201d she said.Len Amato, president of HBO Films, said it was tricky to get the right balance. \u201cIf you only see a small bit of it, it could be really reductive.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 here. Nothing against \u2018Desperate Housewives,\u2019 but that wasn\u2019t the focal point of why people wanted to make the series.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to shape my career in terms of being able to find things that I may not get offered, that I wouldn\u2019t get the opportunity for,\u201d Ms. Kidman said in an interview after the meeting.On this Monday in January, Ms. Kidman commanded the room, though she was relaxed, and at times playful (introducing her producing partner, Per Saari, she said the two are so close that \u201cwe\u2019ve been married for 14 years\u201d). Wearing navy tailored trousers and a crisp white shirt, she seemed taller in person, her Australian accent all the more striking because her non-Australian accents in her work are so familiar.She said she has no real career plan, other than gravitating toward material that interests her, and seeking out writers and directors who are talented but unknown. Blossom commissions scripts out of pocket, to minimize what Ms. Kidman called in an email \u201cthe red tape.\u201d She continues to act in projects she doesn\u2019t produce, and vice versa. \u201cI\u2019m only going for the things that I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise I can sit at home in Nashville and take care of my children\u201d \u2014 referring to her two young daughters with her husband, the country singer Keith Urban \u2014 \u201cand be very happy.\u201dLast year, she shot \u201cThe Beguiled,\u201d a Civil War-era film set in Virginia directed by Sofia Coppola, and \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer,\u201d the latest film, now in postproduction, from Yorgos Lanthimos, who directed \u201cThe Lobster.\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a very safe place in my life right now, a place of feeling far more comfortable with myself so that I can be more extroverted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also means that I can work with people I like.\u201dIt makes sense that \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d became a series on HBO rather than a feature film at a major studio. As superhero and other tentpole movies dominate the release schedules of the major studios, even bona fide movie stars like Natalie Portman, Daniel Craig and Bradley Cooper are bringing their projects to places like HBO, Showtime, Amazon and Netflix.\u201cThere\u2019s not as much of a separation anymore,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a bigger pool to work in, the talent base is much broader than it used to be, and it\u2019s become sort of a blur \u2014 what is television, what is a movie?\u201dJust two and a half years elapsed between conception to finished project. In the spring of 2014, Bruna Pappandrea, Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s former partner in her production company (Pacific Standard), who is also friends with Ms. Kidman, read a galley of \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d thought it was great and called Ms. Witherspoon, who was in New Orleans shooting \u201cHot Pursuit.\u201d Entranced by the book, Ms. Witherspoon got Ms. Kidman, an old friend, to read it, too.Ms. Kidman said she was drawn in by the many moods of the book, by its strong female characters, and that \u201cas much as it\u2019s about women who are feuding, who are trying to destroy one another, it\u2019s also about friendships.\u201d (The character she plays, Celeste, seems to have a perfect life, including a hunky younger husband played by Alexander Skarsgard, but it\u2019s a facade that begins to peel away as the series goes on.)She called Ms. Witherspoon back. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m in if you\u2019re in,\u2019\u201d Ms. Kidman recalled. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018I\u2019m in. Now all we have to do is get it.\u2019\u201d That meant persuading the author, Ms. Moriarty, at home in Australia, to sell them the exclusive rights.Ms. Kidman was on her way there for a vacation, and she and Ms. Moriarty met in a coffee shop in Sydney. Ms. Moriarty said she had not expected much from the meeting. \u201cI\u2019ve had other books optioned before, and other authors have said, \u2018Never get too excited until the day they start shooting,\u2019\u201d she said by telephone. \u201cAnd Nicole said, \u2018If I option it, get excited because I don\u2019t just option things for the sake of it.\u2019\u201dMs. Witherspoon then enlisted Jean-Marc Vallee, who directed Ms. Witherspoon in \u201cWild\u201d \u2014 \u201cAnd then Reese sends Jean-Marc an email,\u2019\u201d is how Ms. Kidman described it \u2014 and the two women then hired David E. Kelley (\u201cAlly McBeal,\u201d \u201cThe Practice\u201d) to write the screenplay.What ensued was a burst of all-female networking activity that Ms. Kidman compared to the way the A-list friends from the \u201cOcean\u2019s 11\u201d films conduct their business. She and Ms. Witherspoon began working the phones. \u201cReese and I were like, \u2018\u201cO.K., let\u2019s go for it,\u2019 and suddenly Shay was in\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s Ms. Woodley \u2014 \u201cand she signs on because Laura Dern, who\u2019s one of her best friends, goes, \u2018I\u2019m in and I\u2019ll talk to Shay,\u201d Ms. Kidman said.With HBO, Ms. Kidman is also working on the dramatization of another novel she optioned, \u201cReconstructing Amelia,\u201d about a mother who sets out to find out why her daughter committed suicide. (Naomi Watts is in discussions to play the main character, Mr. Amato said.) Ms. Kidman said she feels intuitively that this one ought to be a film, rather than a limited series, which appears to be fine with HBO. \u201cIt\u2019s delicate, the balance, how you make these things,\u201d Ms. Kidman said, of the decision to embark on a series or a feature.Mr. Amato\u2019s job means that he meets a great many people pitching their projects. Many actors have production companies, or wish they had production companies, but their levels of commitment and engagement vary wildly, he said.\u201cNot all big stars are as in the weeds as Nicole and Reese are on \u2018Big Little Lies,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual when you have a megastar who\u2019s also a producer sitting around the table doing their homework. It\u2019s meaningful when it comes from people who found the project, who put all the elements together and who are also going to put themselves on the line as actors.\u201dThe two women\u2019s involvement included making decisions about locations and budgets, helping shape character arcs and taking part in script meetings. \u201cWe got to put loads of ideas on the table,\u201d Ms. Kidman said. \u201cAs an actor, you don\u2019t get to do that, but as a producer you have to be there.\u201d\u201cDid you option that?\u201d Mr. Amato asked.\u201cYes, we\u2019ve got a script, and it\u2019s out with a director,\u201d Ms. Kidman responded. She remained mysterious on the subject of where it might end up.Ms. Kidman said that the transformation of television had created a vast menu of possibility for actors, and for producers.\u201cThere are so many great stories out there and so many talented people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe probably would not have been able to do this \u2014 \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 probably wouldn\u2019t have been made \u2014 if it hadn\u2019t been made for TV.\u201dAn article last Sunday about Nicole Kidman referred incorrectly to the film \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d It is a Civil War-era film set in Virginia, not a \u201cCivil War western.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Profits? Nice, but for These Investors, Conscience Matters More", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSeth Holehouse, who owns an auction house in New York City, has focused his investments on renewable energy and recycled products. He has done so for the last five years \u2014 despite steadily losing money on the strategy.It is passion, not profit, that guides him. And he is not about to let up. Instead, he is prepared to keep losing money in the near term with the expectation of gains down the road.\u201cWe\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d he said. \u201cThis philosophy is how we\u2019d like to invest in 20 years.\u201dInvesting with a guiding passion isn\u2019t the same as being an impact investor, who aims to effect social change while earning a solid return. Passion investing is purer \u2014 if not puritanical. And seeing how people who embrace it deploy their strategies shows just how hard it is to follow a passion in investing without some level of compromise.Its better-known cousin, impact investing, tends to attract people who are pragmatic. They are looking for the best possible investment in a sector, based on established criteria.In terms of its volume of greenhouse emissions, for example, a consumer packaging company will most likely score much higher among environmentalists than every company in the oil and gas sector. But a certain type of impact investor might look for the oil and gas company that has improved its business practices the most or is as environmentally responsible and progressive as such a company can be.Instead of swearing off whole sectors, this type of impact investor is looking to make a practical accommodation between today\u2019s reality and tomorrow\u2019s aspiration.Passion investors spurn such accommodations. They are driven by a belief in the primacy of a cause \u2014 animal rights, climate change, reducing waste \u2014 and try to apply that desire to all investment types. It\u2019s not easy.\u201cI have a conversation about this quite often,\u201d said Mark Doman, chief executive of the Doman Group, an investment adviser. \u201cClients talk about how their ethics and morality guide their portfolio. I tell them it\u2019s a very slippery slope to find companies that meet their ethical bar while keeping in mind their goal is to grow their assets.\u201dMr. Doman added, \u201cIf you can find me a morally and ethically pure blue-chip company, that\u2019s more the exception than the rule.\u201dRoyce Pinkwater, a real estate broker in Manhattan, is trying to find such companies that align with her passion \u2014 reducing pollution \u2014 but are also profitable. She has taken to analyzing individual securities through the lens of pollution. This has led to tough choices.She had been earning solid returns investing in Amazon when she began to be concerned about the company\u2019s relationship with its vendors and how those vendors sold and packaged products. Was Amazon monitoring how they did business? How concerned were Amazon and its vendors with reducing the waste caused by their packaging?When people make private investments guided by passion, the risk can seem higher. Losing all of your money in any private investment is always a possibility, particularly in early-stage ventures.But when people assess a private investment primarily on their perception of its underlying merit, it also narrows their options. Their passion, in effect, has limited what may already be a small field of suitable investments.\u201cI have to be willing for the money to go down the drain completely,\u201d he said.It has happened once, with an investment in a food technology company. \u201cIt was a good idea, basically trying to create a more automated supply chain for small farms and organic farms,\u201d Mr. Baltzell said. \u201cThat did not work out.\u201dHowever difficult investing with a pure vision may be, it also comes at the risk of hypocrisy. Mr. Doman has clients passionate about avoiding investments in fossil fuels who have duly refused to put money into oil and gas companies. But one of those clients was comfortable owning stocks in airlines, which, of course, need fossil fuels to fly.\u201cWe talked it through and they said: \u2018Aviation and air travel are an essential part of the economy, and it\u2019s something I use \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity. I guess I can\u2019t go that far,\u2019\u201d Mr. Doman said of the client. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to own BP, Royal Dutch Shell or Mobil, but they\u2019d own American Airlines or Delta. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s a very subjective assessment.\u201dSome investors have put parameters in place to stay focused on their passions but not to go broke.A strategy that loses money for years, like Mr. Holehouse\u2019s focus on renewables, is not one any professional investor could sustain and still be in business. But he said he and his wife did not need their investments to live. And being tied to the jewelry business, he said, has allowed them to invest in gems and rare metals that regular investors cannot access.\u201cKashmir sapphires have gone up 500 percent in the last decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, it gives us more room to let our conscience drive things.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Baltzell\u2019s approach in choosing his angel investments is, by his own admission, one of convenience: He looks at deals that come to him and meet his criteria of reducing waste. (Professional angel investors most likely look at 10 or 20 deals before investing in one or none.)But he limits his angel investments to 20 percent of his net worth. Even if they\u2019re successful, he reasons, they could take years to pay him back.\u201cIf I went totally with my heart, I\u2019d be doing this all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have trouble paying the school bills.\u201dAffluent investors can take a chance others wouldn\u2019t. The question is, Should they?Preston McSwain, managing partner of Fiduciary Wealth Partners in Boston, said being deeply interested in your investment decisions was generally a good thing but focusing almost myopically on a passion could have its downside.\u201cIf you have a very long time horizon it\u2019s certainly something you should spend time on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you need to be broadly diversified based on your goals and objectives.\u201dHe said a simple weighing of pros and cons could help even the most passionate investor gain perspective. The pros with a passion are clear \u2014 this is something the investor believes in.\u201cThe cons could be extreme concentration \u2014 that can help you reach your goals really fast or it gets blown up,\u201d Mr. McSwain said. \u201cAdvisers should try to get people to think why is this important and make sure they don\u2019t get overconcentrated in too much of a good thing.\u201dMs. Pinkwater is one who stepped back. She wanted to invest in Chinese internet companies, thinking this would be a market that would grow steadily. She bought stock in Tencent, the Chinese internet company that owns popular messaging apps like WeChat.But she ended up selling the stock because of Tencent\u2019s growing carbon footprint. She replaced it with Alphabet, the holding company for Google, YouTube and other technology companies. Google is well known for working to lower its carbon emissions, but is also known for getting out of China in 2010 and only now trying to return.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me the same exposure to China,\u201d Ms. Pinkwater said. \u201cI tried. I just wasn\u2019t comfortable with Tencent.\u201dThat is a perfectly dispassionate way to think of a passion investment.Advertisement"}

Another grand party attended by members of Team Trump.With 400 of his closest friends in attendance, the New York financier Stephen A. Schwarzman celebrated his 70th birthday on Saturday at his Four Winds estate in Palm Beach, Fla.Partygoers feasted on short ribs, while two camels wandered along a stretch of sand and a gondolier propelled his craft across the pool. Guests were treated to a 12-minute fireworks display that could be seen across Lake Worth Lagoon. To top off the evening at what is just one of the multibillionaire\u2019s many homes, Gwen Stefani sang \u201cHappy Birthday to You\u201d before taking a quick twirl with the birthday boy around a dance floor constructed inside a two-story tent where acrobats shimmied and jumped.The cost? A person familiar with the planning who was not authorized by the host to speak on the record estimated it at between $7 million and $9 million.How, exactly, does one spend in the millions on a single party? Ken Fulk, a San Francisco events planner who oversaw the wedding of the technology entrepreneur Sean Parker, had some general estimates. A fireworks display can cost as much as $50,000, he said. Dinner for 400 at such an affair can come to about $200,000. But that doesn\u2019t include waiters and other staff members, he said, which can add another $60,000.The guests had cocktails in the entry hall before moving on to the dining area, where later they ate cake sculpted in the shape of a Chinese temple with a dragon curled around the edges of the roof, according to one guest. The day after the celebration, some 150 people attended a private lunch hosted by Mr. Schwarzman.And what about the camels? Mr. Fulk estimated they cost $1,500 apiece. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few camels at parties, too,\u201d he said with a laugh.The Feb. 11 party marked the second Saturday in a row that Palm Beach society f\u00e9ted itself. President Trump and the first lady attended an American Red Cross ball on Feb. 4 at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, a party with a theme of \u201cFrom Vienna to Versailles.\u201d With its harpists, and waiters in powdered wigs, it was an exercise in 18th-century French opulence.The Trump team seems unable to resist a theme party. In December, a \u201cVillains and Heroes\u201d costume party hosted by the Republican donor Robert Mercer drew a contingent that included one of Mr. Trump\u2019s senior advisers, Kellyanne Conway, who wore a Supergirl costume; the billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel, who dressed as the pro wrestler Hulk Hogan; and Mr. Trump, who wore his usual suit and tie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Fill Out Your Tax Return Like a Pro", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrimming your income taxes is an exercise in financial fitness. You are aiming for a low number. As in golf, that\u2019s a goal that can be achieved honorably with skill and practice.This sample return, prepared in consultation with Bob Meighan, a vice president of TurboTax, the tax software published by Intuit, guides you through the process. Understanding how it works can help, whether you rely on a professional preparer do your own return by hand or use software, as we did here.All taxpayers get the benefit of lower brackets on part of their taxable income. For married couples filing jointly, the 25 percent bracket applies to taxable income\u00a0above $75,300 and up to $151,900, and taxable income is calculated after various breaks are taken.They have three dependents: their children, Cyril and Heidi, and an elderly parent, Sydney, who lives with them, so they claimed five personal exemptions. Itemized deductions and education credits also helped to reduce their\u00a0taxable\u00a0income\u00a0taxes.Form 1040 first asks a taxpayer to list all income. Then it factors in adjustments, deductions and personal exemptions to determine how much income is taxable. Most of the numbers are transferred from worksheets or supplemental forms and schedules. Taxable income and the tax on it are calculated on Page 2, as are credits \u2014 which are more valuable than deductions, because they reduce taxes dollar for dollar. The Internal Revenue Service encourages taxpayers to file electronically. However, people who prepare their own returns may mail in paper forms. Either way, the preparation is the same.First, gather papers related to income and deductions, including the official forms: W-2, 1099, 1098, K-1 and others sent by employers, banks, brokerage firms and anyone else who paid you. Payers must also send copies to the I.R.S. The agency\u2019s computers compare returns with what the payers report. If you are missing a W-2 or a 1099; go to the source for a new copy.This couple did not have to file Schedule B because they did not earn more than $1,500 in either interest or dividends.As an unincorporated engineering consultant, Samuel must file Schedule C for a sole proprietorship.Asset sales that resulted in a net capital gain or loss are reported on Schedule D, which takes numbers from Form 8949. Last summer, the couple, feeling anxious about the presidential campaign, and seeing the value of their stocks in Twitter and Goldman Sachs losing value, sold those shares. They\u00a0lost $3,279.50 on Goldman (Part\u00a01I\u00a0of Schedule 8949) and $5,868 on Twitter (Part II of 8949).\u00a0Losses of up to $3,000 can be used to offset ordinary income; any more may be carried forward to future years. Schedule D is also used to report sales of real estate, artwork and other assets, including municipal bonds. (Only the interest on these bonds, not any profit on sales, is tax-exempt.) The Taxpayers did not have any of these sales to report.The costs for the sales reported include brokerage fees and charges, and the sale price is calculated after deducting such fees. Assets held for a year or less are short term, and their sales are reported in Part I.\u00a0Short-term gains are taxed like ordinary income. Long-term gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, and are tax-free for those in the 10 and 15 percent brackets.Two credits for education, the American Opportunity Credit, which may be claimed for four years of undergraduate education, provided the student is enrolled at least half time, and the Lifetime Learning Credit, may be claimed on this form.The income limit for claiming the full American Opportunity Credit is a modified adjusted gross income of $80,000 for single filers, but those with incomes up to $90,000 can claim a reduced credit. The range is $160,000 to $180,000 for married couples filing jointly.The tax code has other breaks for educational costs, which tax software may identify for users who answer its\u00a0questionnaire.Advertisement"}

Why were they here? The answer remains a mystery.Dr. Watling and her team reconstructed a 6,000-year-old environmental history of two geoglyph sites in the Amazon rain forest. To do this, they searched for clues in soil samples in and around the sites. Microscopic plant fossils called phytoliths told them about ancient vegetation. Bits of charcoal revealed evidence of burnings. And a kind of carbon dating gave them a sense of how open the vegetation had been in the past.About 4,000 years ago, people started burning the forest, which was mostly bamboo, just enough to make small openings. They may have planted maize or squash, weeded out some underbrush, and transported seeds or saplings to create a partly curated forest of useful tree products that Dr. Watling calls a \u201cprehistoric supermarket.\u201d After that, they started building the geoglyphs.

Her teenage son studies late into the night and her 88-year-old mother, who suffers from dementia, gets agitated at night. To tackle the problems, Ms. Conn looked up \u2014 at her light bulbs.Ms. Conn, 61, is among a small, but growing, group of people who are altering the lighting in their homes not just for aesthetics, but for health, too.Disruptions to our circadian rhythm can affect weight loss, libido, mood and sleep patterns. And chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers.Such lighting comes at a premium, particularly if you replace all the lights in a room, or an entire apartment. The starter kit for Philips Hue white and color ambience lights cost $199 for three bulbs and a device to link the bulbs to a wireless network. A single Good Night bulb costs $24.95. An Awake and Alert bulb costs $28.95.When Mike House and his wife, Sierra Zamarripa, renovated their two-bedroom in Serenity House, a co-op on East Ninth Street, they spent time thinking, and arguing, about lighting.The couple hunted down vintage lamps and shades, rewiring them. Mr. House did find a way to incorporate more energy-saving bulbs into the mix: They selected Lighting Science bulbs for the bedroom to help their infant daughter sleep. At first, Ms. Zamarripa \u201cwas resistant because she is an antiques purist,\u201d Mr. House said. \u201cBut she came around.\u201dBut the secret behind a good night\u2019s sleep, often an elusive goal for new parents, is not always easy to pinpoint. \u201cDoes my kid sleep well through the night totally? Yes,\u201d Mr. House said. \u201cWould I say it\u2019s because of the light? It\u2019s hard to say.\u201dIndeed, it is hard for an average user to know how much that soothing glow helps. Ms. Conn of East 49th Street finds that her mother, Doris Padawer, is less agitated at night now. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, but when you have dementia, you have a lot of anxiety,\u201d Ms. Conn said. As for her son and the bulb\u2019s intended use to help him focus, she said, \u201cHe definitely sits at his desk to study, let\u2019s put it this way.\u201d\u201cWhat you see in the whole consumer market is they give you the tool of the bulb,\u201d she said, but not the software necessary to \u201cprogram that light to really enhance your life.\u201dUltimately biological lighting is only as beneficial as the person using it, as I discovered during my attempt to improve sleep habits in my household. The packaging for the Good Night light includes directions advising consumers to use the light as \u201cpart of a healthy bedtime routine\u201d that includes limiting the use of electronic devices and other light sources for two hours before bedtime.With a few bulbs, I transformed the bedrooms in my home into warm, cozy cocoons of yellow glowing light. Although the mood has done nothing to convince the children that their beds are not trampolines, they do seem to drift off to sleep faster. As for me, no amount of soothing light in a bedroom helps if I\u2019m binge watching \u201cThe Affair\u201d all night in the living room. But at least it\u2019s a start.Advertisement"}

So their connection to a genuine black culture in America was compromised, at best. For all that, they put black heroes on the screen.The first movie I watched on the site isn\u2019t even American. \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d is a 1972 Jamaican film (co-written and directed by Perry Henzell), a semi-underground classic that remains one of the most potent pop outlaw movies ever made: Its hero, played by the reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, simultaneously becomes Jamaica\u2019s most wanted criminal and its record chart topper. Tough, funny and fueled by a spectacular reggae soundtrack, it was one of the first movies in English that included subtitles for American audiences (because of the Jamaican patois spoken by the characters), and it holds up quite well.That\u2019s not the case with either \u201cBlack Caesar\u201d or \u201cHell Up in Harlem,\u201d two \u201970s films written and directed by Larry Cohen, who was then a veteran TV writer whose directorial debut, \u201cBone\u201d (not on the service), was a shockingly funny and corrosive look at intimate race relations in Los Angeles.Like many blaxploitation films, these are, in some ways, exercises in speculative metafiction. A good number of blaxploitation movies took narrative outlines and antihero trappings from classic crime films and changed the ethnicity. \u201cBlack Caesar,\u201d in particular, is a remake of the 1931 gangster picture \u201cThe Public Enemy\u201d transposed to Harlem of the 1970s. Despite the sardonic way Mr. Cohen\u2019s films equate gangsterism with all-American capitalism, there\u2019s not much in the way of effective subversion, subtextual or otherwise.Similarly, the films that the actress Pam Grier made with the director Jack Hill, \u201cCoffy\u201d (1973) and \u201cFoxy Brown\u201d (1974), flip the script on grimy sadistic low-budget revenge films by making the avenger a strong black woman, but that\u2019s pretty much it. And in some respects, that\u2019s sufficient for satisfyingly offbeat, lurid entertainment.More than a couple of the films don\u2019t quite fit the \u201cbadass\u201d honorific the site bestows on its own library. The screen beauty Jacqueline Bisset had an early lead role in \u201cThe Grasshopper\u201d (1970), a grim cautionary tale of a dreamer turned call girl (co-produced by Garry Marshall, many years before he directed \u201cPretty Woman\u201d), in which she has an interracial romance with Jim Brown before a few bad things happen.\u201cMr. Ricco,\u201d which you don\u2019t read about in histories of Hollywood\u2019s \u201970s cinema renaissance, is a platitudinous drama from 1975 starring Dean Martin as a San Francisco lawyer whose successful defense of a black client backfires on him. Despite the presence of Thalmus Rasulala as the client, the picture is of more interest to Martin completists than any other demographic. (Sample dialogue exchange: Martin: \u201cYou really see yourself as a big black hero, don\u2019t you?\u201d Rasulala: \u201cWhen was the last time you volunteered to have your taxes audited?\u201d)\u201cMr. Ricco\u201d was directed by Paul Bogart, who also made \u201cHalls of Anger\u201d (1970), an extra-turgid high school integration drama starring Calvin Lockhart and featuring early turns from Rob Reiner and Jeff Bridges. That movie features a scene in which an attractive white female student is harassed and forcibly stripped by several black teen girls who want to determine if the white student is \u201cblond all over.\u201dThe site does offer two landmarks of African-American cinema, Melvin Van Peebles\u2019s tortured, bluntly confrontational \u201cSweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song\u201d (1971) and Bill Gunn\u2019s \u201cGanja & Hess\u201d (1973), a vampire story that consistently upends the conventions of all the genres from which it draws. One of the stars, Duane Jones, is the superb actor who starred in the 1968 horror classic \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and whose career never broke out of genre films \u2014 with the exception of the 1982 drama \u201cLosing Ground,\u201d directed by Kathleen Collins.Brown Sugar, which charges subscribers $3.99 a month, has a library of just over 100 films available. Jim Weiss, a communications executive at Bounce TV, said in an email, \u201cOur goal is for Brown Sugar to have the widest and deepest collection of movies possible; refreshing our library and delighting our consumers with new titles monthly is at the heart of our mission.\u201dI\u2019m not in the business of telling other businesses their business, but it seems to me that if the service wants to build on its existing formula, expanding its own parameters to include work by maverick African-American filmmakers both past and present wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea. The aesthetic, or at least the ideological, distance between, say, \u201cGanja & Hess\u201d and Haile Gerima\u2019s searing \u201cAshes and Embers\u201d (1982) is not as great as one might immediately presume.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grading Obamacare: Successes, Failures and \u2018Incompletes\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthDid Obamacare work?It\u2019s worth reflecting upon after President Trump and House Republicans failed on Friday to repeal and replace the \u201cdisaster\u201d of Obamacare.Ever since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it has been so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate. But by looking at the many ways the law has changed health care, it\u2019s possible to hazard some judgments.For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to make health insurance affordable to all who want it, the rational answer is: No, Obamacare did not achieve uniform affordability. Health care in the United States remains the most expensive in the world, and coverage remains out of the financial reach of many Americans.For those who believe the primary goal of the law was to make Americans healthier, the answer has to be: It is too soon to tell.One thing is clear, though \u2014 the Affordable Care Act has shifted the nation\u2019s baseline expectations for how health care should work. Its successes have pushed Republican politicians, like Mr. Trump, into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all Americans. Its failures have become focal points, too, leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals.There are layers beneath each judgment, of course. The law was broad and complex, with many goals and provisions. This assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments. For many important questions, there is not yet strong evidence either way.Not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to have insurance or pay a fine. Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions.In many parts of the country, only one insurer even offers health plans, limiting the choices available to consumers.But it will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health, or how large that effect may be. Even though the law allowed 20 million more people to get coverage, that\u2019s a small fraction of the nation\u2019s population, and it often takes years for health care services to result in measurable benefits.The health law contained many provisions intended to make medical care safer and more evidence-based. The health system is still often a dangerous place for patients, but fewer are contracting infections in the hospital, for example, or leaving the hospital only to be readmitted in a few weeks. Some trends were underway before the health law passed, so it is difficult to tease out how much change was caused by Obamacare or would have happened anyway.An Upshot article on Monday about the successes and failures of the Affordable Care Act misstated part of the name of a budget analysis group. It is the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, not the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget.Advertisement"}

There are Southern-style BBQ joints that look straight out of Brooklyn; gastro pubs with cocktail gardens; and a chain of crepe restaurants that has set up shop in nearly every neighborhood. Yet regional Colombian fare from outside the capital has long been the city\u2019s weak spot. Until now.As Bogot\u00e1 has increasingly become a melting pot of cultures from every part of Colombia, restaurants focusing on regional dishes and ingredients are opening with regularity.Each table is set with bottles of house-made hot sauces and chile-infused vinegars, which can be bought on the way out.

The recipe for a corn and peanut soup called samai, in fact, comes from a grandmother named Mercedes Tisoy, who serves it during celebrations in the high-altitude Sibundoy Valley, in the southwest of the country.Inside, 60 students enrolled in a two-year program do a range of tasks, like roasting their own coffee, which is sold in the cafe; working the register; and deep-frying plantains to make fritters. The lunch-only menu offers dishes like fried Magdalena River fish, called mojarra, with coconut rice, or the chuleta valluna, a breaded pork chop typical of the rural Cauca Valley outside Cali. The young servers also help decipher the long list of freshly pressed juices like araz\u00e1 or camu camu.Colombia\u2019s undeveloped and rarely visited Pacific Coast has a set of ingredients all its own, like a shark called a toyo, and an herb called cilantro cimarr\u00f3n; if you wanted to taste them, however, you were probably better off going to the port town of to Buenaventura.\u201cIn Europe they have foie gras, in the Pacific we have piangua,\u201d he said, referring to the region\u2019s flavorful, nutrient-rich black clam, with which he makes a ceviche. \u201cEsto es puro Pacifico.\u201dThe Heads Up column last Sunday, about regional Colombian dishes, misspelled the name of a region in the country.

For though she made the requisite nods to the signature chain-mail gown, in the form of a halter-necked bias-draped gold number and a mini version in bronze, her Versace is less about worshiping the Amazon goddess of curves than powering through.So there were power puffas in blue and yellow, and power shearlings in orange and black; power shoulders and power pantsuits (jackets cropped, trousers full) and power flowers for evening. There was not a shrinking violet in sight, though there were some rather lurid color combinations that may read better on social media than in real life.Either way, you can\u2019t miss the fact that flirtation has broadly been abandoned in favor of fortification.Tougher, men\u2019s wear fabrics and suiting have been omnipresent: at Etro, where Veronica Etro mixed tweed and corduroy, Tibetan silk and sherpa shearling, into a m\u00e9lange meant for a self-selecting tribe. At Agnona, where houndstooth met thick ribbed cashmere \u00e0 la super luxe Sherlock. At Antonio Marras, where the first woman to be named to a university chair in Italy, Eva Mameli, and the modern performance maestra Pina Bausch inspired a wholly charming dance-off between tailoring and tulle, pinstripes and painterly embroidery.Leather is on the rise, ascendant at Tod\u2019s, where the design team went back to its bags and driving-shoe roots for trench coats, motorcycle jackets, trousers and skirts in supple calfskin and shades of black, brown, red and white (the simplest statement yet of brand identity). Also Jil Sander, where Rodolfo Paglialunga, in what was rumored to be his last collection for the brand, offered his inflationary boardroom suiting in black patent, cashmere and felt \u2014 though the proportions were so oversized, it often seemed as if the clothes were swallowing the body, instead of swaddling it.Still, it\u2019s clear fashion has decided its mission is to gird women for a fight (or to protect them, depending on how you look at it). Some of the armoring is simply more overt than others. But just because something is subtle doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t exert a powerful force. As Tomas Maier demonstrated at Bottega Veneta.Working from an obliquely 1940s silhouette, with strong, squared-off shoulders (as in \u201ccarry the world on\u2026\u201d) and a defined, curving waist (for men as well as women) he gave sophistication a missile-sharp precision. Suits were nipped in and no-nonsense; dresses puff-sleeved and graceful. Decoration came in the form of metal studs. The coats, for both men and women, had a military bearing; the trousers were cropped. \u201cThey were designed at the same time and speak the same language,\u201d Mr. Maier observed of his clothes for both genders.That was clearly true. But just as clear was the fact that it was the opening woman\u2019s look \u2014 olive green ribbed sweater and jodhpurs, on the now 43-year-old model Eva Herzigova \u2014 that carried the biggest pow, defining the terms and setting the pace for the show. And it was the women, resplendent in a finale of gowns in gunmetal gray and gold lam\u00e9, part Boudicca, part Veronica Lake, that finished it off. In between, the men, in their bow ties and tuxedo cardigans, played a supporting role.That may be because this is still, officially, the women\u2019s season, despite the growing (and logical) movement toward combining the sexes, but nevertheless it felt particularly relevant in a way that went beyond fashion.

{"Headline": "Brewers Hope Eric Thames, Ruthian in South Korea, Has Crossover Power", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BaseballPHOENIX \u2014 A package arrived recently for Eric Thames at Maryvale Baseball Park, the spring training home of the Milwaukee Brewers. It was a fungo bat, thin-handled and light, a tool to help make his hands quicker. Thames had ordered it for $30 on Amazon.\u201cI opened the box and I was taking the bar code off it, and the clubhouse guy was like, \u2018Hey, did you buy that bat?\u2019\u201d said Thames, who replied that he had. \u201cHe says: \u2018You know, this is the big leagues. I have fungoes back there I can give you.\u2019\u201dThames laughed. He was, indeed, in a major league clubhouse, with an eight-figure contract and a team that was counting on him. He was not in South Korea anymore.\u201cI was so embarrassed,\u201d Thames said. \u201cI was like: \u2018It\u2019s been a while. Just give me a few weeks to adapt.\u2019\u201dFor the last three years, Thames adapted just fine with the NC Dinos of the Korea Baseball Organization. A marginal major leaguer for Toronto and Seattle in 2011 and 2012, Thames erupted for the Dinos, hitting .348 and averaging 41 homers and 126 R.B.I. His on-base plus slugging percentage was 1.171; the career major league record, held by Babe Ruth, is 1.164.Thames is not Babe Ruth. But the rebuilding Brewers believe he\u2019s a better value than Chris Carter, the slugger he replaces at first base. Last season Carter hit .222 with 206 strikeouts \u2014 but tied for the National League lead in homers, with 41. That put him in line to be awarded perhaps $10 million in salary arbitration.The Brewers let him go, and Carter eventually signed with the Yankees for $3.5 million. Thames did much better on the open market, getting a three-year, $16 million deal from the Brewers with a club option for 2020. They don\u2019t quite know how his production will translate, but the possibilities are enticing.\u201cWe expect a productive major league player,\u201d said David Stearns, the Brewers\u2019 general manager. \u201cThat can take shape in a variety of ways. With a signing like this, there\u2019s a fairly wide variance of potential outcomes, and we think there\u2019s a lot of upside there. We\u2019re going to put him in a comfortable environment that will allow him to adjust back to major league baseball, and hopefully his talents will take over.\u201dThames, 30, has played 181 games in the majors, with a .250 average and 21 homers. He has just three major league stolen bases, but stole 40 for the Dinos in 2015. He has a .296 on-base percentage in the majors, but had a .450 mark in the K.B.O., where ballparks tend to be small and the talent level is considered to be below that of the Japanese league.The Brewers did not scout Thames in person, but did study him extensively on video. Pitchers feared Thames and rarely challenged him with fastballs, but he displayed discipline at the plate, laying off junk and waiting for breaking balls he could mash. The pitch patterns will be different now, but the Brewers believe Thames can handle them.\u201cHe\u2019s going to see more consistent velocity than he\u2019s seen the past couple of years, but I think he\u2019s frankly looking forward to that,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cIt\u2019s a more normal style of hitting than constantly trying to guess which shade of breaking ball he\u2019s going to see.\u201dThames is eager for those fastballs, and everything else about the major league life. He made good money in South Korea \u2014 about $3.5 million, plus a Kia Sorento for winning the Most Valuable Player Award in 2015. But some of the game\u2019s customs there grew tiresome, like the emphasis on bunting and the practice of dressing in full uniform at the hotel before road games. And while Thames had a few American teammates, communication with others was limited.Thames was essentially his own hitting coach with the Dinos, and reinvented his approach. He watched interviews on technique with stars like the Detroit sluggers Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez, absorbing their lessons and teaching himself a new swing after finding his old one too inconsistent.\u201cI\u2019d be very uphill, so a lot of balls I\u2019d hit would have topspin,\u201d Thames said. \u201cIf I got it perfect, it\u2019d be a home run, but if I just missed it a little bit, topspin, so it would be off the wall or even knuckle and it wouldn\u2019t travel as far. Now I work hard to stay short to the ball but have a flat path \u2014 finish flat, not just try to be up there hitting dingers all day.\u201dBy not swinging for the fences, Thames began clearing them regularly. As a left-handed-hitting first baseman with power, a thick beard and a relatively short frame (6 feet), Thames recalls a former Brewer, Prince Fielder. His path to Milwaukee was just a lot less conventional.\u201cEric\u2019s in a sweet spot for all this,\u201d said Craig Counsell, the Brewers\u2019 manager. \u201cHe\u2019s got something to prove, and I think he feels that. That\u2019s a really good place to be for players, when they feel they\u2019ve got something to prove.\u201dOnly one returning Brewer, Ryan Braun, hit 20 home runs last season, so the team needs Thames\u2019s power. Counsell said he was also intrigued by Thames\u2019s potential on the basepaths; the Brewers went 73-89 last season but easily led the majors in steals.Some players, like Jung Ho Kang in Pittsburgh, have starred in the K.B.O. and adapted well to the major league game. Others, like Byung Ho Park in Minnesota, have flopped. Thames has not set statistical goals for the season; there are too many pitchers to learn and decode, he said, and all he can do is work diligently to apply his skills.If he fails, he will be severely overpaid. If he succeeds, the Brewers will have a bargain. After fourth-place finishes the last two seasons, they need Thames to help plot their road map to contention.\u201cThis year will be the year that informs us the most about where we really are on the timeline for competing,\u201d said Mark Attanasio, the Brewers\u2019 principal owner. \u201cThis team will tell us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
